CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, among others, statements relating to: 
 the potential uses for and advantages of XHANCE , the EXHALATION DELIVERY SYSTEM (also referred to as, the EDS and related technologies; 
 the potential benefits of the recent FDA approval of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps; 
 our commercial plans and expectations for XHANCE including, among other things, the launch of XHANCE for its new indication; 
 the potential to expand promotion of XHANCE into the primary care segment and our plans to seek a partner for such expansion; 
 our belief that the current practice of postoperative intranasal steroid (INS) use could support XHANCE s adoption as a maintenance therapy to improve outcomes following sinus surgery; 
 the potential for XHANCE to be the standard of care for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps; 
 the potential for direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising to be a future driver of XHANCE prescription growth; 
 the potential benefits of our patient affordability programs (including changes made to the XHANCE co-pay assistance program) and their potential effect on XHANCE demand and financial results; 
 the potential benefits of, and impact of transitioning XHANCE business to, a Hub model; 
 our expectation for XHANCE prescriptions to be impacted by the seasonality observed in the INS market and the seasonal variation in patient visits with their doctor; 
 our expectation for XHANCE prescriptions and average net revenue per prescription to be adversely impacted by the annual resetting of patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles and changes in individual patients' healthcare insurance coverage, both of which often occur in January; 
 our expectations relating to the impact on average net product revenues per prescription resulting from changes we made to the XHANCE co-pay support program and disruptions that occurred at Change Healthcare, the claims processor for our vendor that administers the XHANCE co-pay support program; 
 XHANCE prescription, net revenue, prescriber and other business trends; 
 the potential for payor utilization management criteria to negatively impact XHANCE prescription volumes; 
 the rate and degree of market acceptance and market opportunity of XHANCE; 
 our belief that an inflection in new prescriptions commenced in September and continued through the week ended October 25, 2024 (which is the most recent week for which a full prescription data set was available prior to the filing of this Form 10-Q); 
 our expectation that our operating expenses (consisting of selling, general administrative expenses and research development expenses) in 2024 will be between 90.0 million and 93.0 million and that our non-cash stock-based compensation expense will be approximately 6.0 million; 
 our expectation that XHANCE net product revenues for the full year of 2024 will be between 75.0 million and 79.0 million; 
 our expectation that the average net product revenue per prescription for XHANCE for the full year of 2024 will be approximately 270;

 our potential non-compliance with certain covenants of the A R Note Purchase Agreement, the consequences of failing to achieve compliance with such covenants and our plans to seek to mitigate such risks; 
 our belief that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months if we are able to maintain compliance with or obtain a waiver or modification of the financial and other covenants under A R Note Purchase Agreement; 
 our expectations and the accuracy of our estimates regarding our future expenses, revenue, capital requirements, potential sources of capital and consequences of failing to obtain additional capital; 
 our ability to continue as a going concern; 
 as well as other statements relating to our future operations, financial performance and financial condition, prospects, strategies, objectives or other future events. Forward-looking statements appear primarily in the sections of this Form 10-Q entitled Item 1. Financial Statements, and Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by words such as may, will, could, would, should, expect, intend, plan, anticipate, "target," believe, estimate, predict, project, potential, continue, ongoing, scheduled and similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. 
 Forward-looking statements are based upon our current expectations and assumptions and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those expressed or implied by such statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Form 10-Q and in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in particular, the risks and uncertainties discussed therein under the caption Risk Factors . Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. 
 Additionally, the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q represent our views only as of the date of this Form 10-Q (or any earlier date indicated in such statement). While we may update certain forward-looking statements from time to time, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if new information becomes available in the future. However, you are advised to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in the reports that we file with the SEC. 
 The foregoing cautionary statements are intended to qualify all forward-looking statements wherever they may appear in this Form 10-Q. For all forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

 and a working capital deficit of . 
 The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other life sciences companies, including successful discovery, development and commercialization of its products and product candidates, raising additional capital, the development by its competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology and market acceptance of the Company's products. The Company has incurred recurring net losses since its inception and has accumulated a deficit of as of September 30, 2024. 
 On May 10, 2024, the Company completed a registered direct offering pursuant to which it issued an aggregate of shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share and, in lieu of shares of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock at a price of per pre-funded warrant, which represents the per share offering price for common stock less the per share exercise price for each such pre-funded warrant. The net proceeds from the offering were million. 
 The Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement) on September 12, 2019 with funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors, LP (Pharmakon), the investment manager of the BioPharma Credit Funds (BioPharma) which was subsequently amended on August 13, 2020, March 2, 2021, November 16, 2021, August 10, 2022, and November 9, 2022. 
 On November 23, 2022, the Company amended and restated the Note Purchase Agreement (the A R Note Purchase Agreement). Pursuant to the A R Note Purchase Agreement, the financial covenants requiring the Company to achieve minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net product sales and royalties were modified. The Company entered into the first amendment to the A R Note Purchase Agreement (the First Amendment) on March 5, 2024, which waived certain covenants. The Company entered into the second amendment to the A R Note Purchase Agreement (the Second Amendment) on March 8, 2024, which further modified the financial covenants. On May 8, 2024, the Company entered into the third amendment to the A R Note Purchase Agreement (the Third Amendment), which provided for a further waiver to the requirement that the Company's annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements not be subject to any statement as to "going concern" (the "going concern covenant") through the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2025, and modified the minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents that the Company is required to maintain at all times under the A R Note Purchase Agreement (see Note 8 ). The principal balance outstanding under the A R Note Purchase Agreement was at September 30, 2024.

quarterly installments of million each through maturity in June 2027. The Company believes that it is probable that, absent additional capital, it will not be able to maintain compliance with the minimum cash covenant under the A R Note Purchase Agreement once it makes the second principal repayment, which is due on December 31, 2025. 
 The Company believes it is probable that it will not be able to maintain compliance with the trailing twelve-month minimum consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties thresholds under the A R Note Purchase Agreement for the entire one year period after the date these consolidated financial statements are issued, which will constitute a default under the A R Note Purchase Agreement if the Company is unable to obtain a modification or waiver of such minimum consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties thresholds. 
 In the event of the foregoing default, the holders of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes may declare an event of default under the A R Note Purchase Agreement and may elect to accelerate the repayment of all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts due, which may require the Company to delay or curtail its operations until additional funding is received. The terms of the A R Note Purchase Agreement and the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes, including applicable covenants, are described in Note 8 . 
 
 Management s plans to mitigate these risks include enhancing its commercial performance to accelerate growth in net revenues, seeking out partnership and collaboration opportunities to expand the market for XHANCE, and, if required, requesting a modification or waiver of the covenants under the A R Note Purchase Agreement, or refinancing the debt. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in accelerating growth in net revenues, expanding the market for XHANCE through partnerships or collaborations, obtaining a modification or waiver of the covenants under the A R Note Purchase Agreement, and/or refinancing the debt. If the Company is unable to accelerate growth in net revenues, expand the market for XHANCE through partnerships or collaborations, obtain a modification or waiver of the covenants under the A R Note Purchase Agreement, or refinance the debt, the Company may need to delay or curtail its operations. As a result of these factors, management has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these consolidated financial statements are issued.

 The Company purchases XHANCE and its components from several third-party suppliers and manufacturing partners, certain of which are only available through a single source. Although the Company could obtain each of these components from alternative third-party suppliers, it would need to qualify and obtain FDA approval for another supplier as a source for each such component.

Diluted income (loss) per common share, (Diluted), also includes the weighted average of common stock equivalents, if the inclusion of such common stock equivalents would be dilutive. Dilutive common stock equivalents potentially include warrants, stock options and non-vested restricted stock awards using the treasury stock method. As occurred in the nine month periods ended 
 Septembe r 30 , 2024, the Diluted calculation was further adjusted by the unrealized gains on the liability classified warrants under the assumption that the gains would not have been recorded if the warrants had been exercised.

Assumptions Used in Determining Fair Value of Liability-Classified Warrants 
 The Company issued warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock at a public offering price of per warrant (the Warrants). Each Warrant has an exercise price of per share of common stock and is exercisable until the expiration date, which is the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance (November 23, 2027). After such date, any unexercised Warrants will expire and have no further value. If the Company issues or sells, or is deemed pursuant to the terms of the Warrants to have issued or sold, any shares of common stock (which includes, among other things, options and securities convertible into shares of common stock), subject to certain exceptions and excluding certain issuances defined in the Warrants as "excluded issuances", for a price per share less than the exercise price of the Warrants in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale (such event, a "dilutive issuance"), then immediately after such dilutive issuance the exercise price then in

 (or on election of such holder, prior to the issuance of any Warrants, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Warrants; provided, however, such holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of , provided that any increase in such percentage shall not be effective until 61 days after such notice is delivered to the Company. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant, the Company could be required to settle the Warrants in cash in the event of a "fundamental transaction" as defined in the Warrant (which includes, among other things, an acquisition of the Company) and, as a result, the Warrants are required to be measured at fair value and reported as liability in the consolidated balance sheet. 
 The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model which incorporates assumptions as to the stock price volatility, the expected life of the warrants, a risk-free interest rate, as well as timing and probability of equity financing. The Company values the warrant liability at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Strike price Expected volatility Risk-free interest rate Expected dividend yield Expected life (years) Fair value per warrant 
 On May 10, 2024, the Company completed a registered direct offering which resulted in the exercise price of the Warrants being reduced from to (which was the offering price of each share sold in the registered direct offering) pursuant to the anti-dilution price protection provisions of such Warrants. All other terms of the Warrants remain unchanged.

equal quarterly installments of principal and interest through the New Maturity Date. As part of the A R Note Purchase Agreement the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes now bear an amended interest rate through the New Maturity Date equal to the -month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (subject to a floor), determined as of the date that is two business days prior to the commencement of each quarter, plus per annum, which interest rate shall be increased by an additional per annum upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any event of default. The effective interest rate as of September 30, 2024 is . 
 
 As an inducement for the holders of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes to enter into the A R Note Purchase Agreement, the Company was required to pay the holders of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes an amendment fee of (representing of the then outstanding principal balance of such notes) due on the New Maturity Date or the earlier repayment of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes, which amendment fee shall be reduced to in the event that the Company repays the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes in full on or after the one-year anniversary of the date of the A R Note Purchase Agreement and prior to second anniversary of the date of the A R Note Purchase Agreement. Additionally, the fee payable under the Fourth Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement that the Company entered into on November 9, 2022 will be credited against the amendment fee payable in connection with the A R Note Purchase Agreement. 
 
 On March 5, 2024, the Company entered into a first amendment and waiver (the First Amendment) to the A R note Purchase Agreement. The First Amendment provided for a waiver of Going Concern Covenant for the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and unaudited quarterly financial statements for the quarter ending March 31, 2024. 
 
 On March 8, 2024, the Company entered into a second amendment (the Second Amendment) to the A R Note Purchase Agreement. 

June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2024 March 31, 2025 June 30, 2025 September 30, 2025 December 31, 2025 March 31, 2026 June 30, 2026 September 30, 2026 December 31, 2026 March 31, 2027 June 30, 2027

th-month anniversary of the effective date of the A R Note Purchase Agreement), the sum of all interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of the notes prepaid or required to be prepaid from the date of such prepayment through and including the th-month anniversary of such prepayment date; and (b) for any prepayment occurring after November 21, 2024 (which represents the th-month anniversary of the effective date of the A R Note Purchase Agreement) but prior to May 21, 2026 (which represents the nd-month anniversary of the effective date of the A R Note Purchase Agreement), the sum of all interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of the notes prepaid or required to be prepaid from the date of such prepayment through and including May 21, 2026 (which represents the nd-month anniversary of the effective date of the A R Note Purchase Agreement); provided, however, that in no event shall all make-whole amounts payable by the Company exceed in the aggregate. 
 
 On May 8, 2024, the Company entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment) to the A R Note Purchase Agreement. The Third Amendment provided for a further waiver of the Going Concern Covenant for the Company s quarterly and annual financial statements through the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2025. The Going Concern Covenant will continue to apply to the Company s financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025 and each fiscal quarter and fiscal year thereafter. In addition, pursuant to the Third Amendment the minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents that the Company is required to maintain at all times under the A R Note Purchase Agreement (the Liquidity Covenant) will be reduced from to following the date of the first quarterly payment of principal due on September 30, 2025. 
 
 As part of the Third Amendment, the Company issued an aggregate of shares of common stock to the holders of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes in satisfaction of of outstanding amendment and waiver fees owed under the A R Note Purchase Agreement for prior amendments and waivers, which shares were calculated based on the offering price of each share of common stock sold in the registered direct offering completed on May 10, 2024. Additionally, the common stock warrants, dated November 18, 2021, issued to the holders of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes for the purchase of an aggregate of shares of Company common stock (the Pharmakon Warrants) were amended to (i) reduce the exercise price of the Pharmakon Warrants from per share to , which is the offering price of each share of common stock sold in the registered direct offering completed by the Company on May 10, 2024, and (ii) extend the expiration date of the Pharmakon Warrants from November 18, 2024 to November 18, 2026. 
 
 The Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors and the A R Note Purchase Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type, including limitations on the Company s and its subsidiaries ability, among other things, to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make investments and acquisitions, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets, pay dividends and distributions, repay junior indebtedness, incur a material adverse change and enter into affiliate transactions, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the A R Note Purchase Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain certain minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties, tested on a quarterly basis, and to maintain compliance with the Liquidity Covenant. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants. The A R Note Purchase Agreement also includes events of default customary for financings of this type, in certain cases subject to customary periods to cure, following which the holders of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes may accelerate all amounts outstanding under such notes. 
 
 The Company believes that it is probable that it will not maintain compliance with the required trailing twelve-month minimum consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties thresholds for the entire one year period after the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. As a result, in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 470, the Company has classified all outstanding principal and the payment of additional fees upon maturity as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The Company classified the Pharmakon debt as a current liability at December 31, 2023 as it believed that, without additional capital, it was unlikely to comply with certain covenants in the A R Note Purchase Agreement.

 Company Overview 
 W e are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of products for patients treated by ear, nose and throat (ENT) and allergy specialists. Our first commercial product, XHANCE (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray, 93 micrograms (mcg), is a therapeutic utilizing our proprietary Exhalation Delivery System (EDS that delivers a topically-acting corticosteroid for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps. Chronic rhinosinusitis is a serious nasal inflammatory disease that is treated using therapies, such as intranasal steroids (INS), which have significant limitations. We believe XHANCE has a differentiated clinical profile with the potential to become part of the standard of care for this disease because it is able to deliver medication to the primary site of inflammation high and deep in the nasal passages in regions not adequately reached by conventional INS. Additionally, we believe the current practice of postoperative INS use could support XHANCE s adoption as a maintenance therapy to improve outcomes following sinus surgery. 
 XHANCE was approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2017 for the treatment of nasal polyps in patients 18 years of age or older (which indication statement was subsequently changed to "chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps" in patients 18 years of age or older to reflect new FDA labeling terminology and not based on new XHANCE clinical trial data). We made XHANCE widely available through commercial channels in April 2018. On March 15, 2024, the FDA approved XHANCE for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps in patients 18 years of age and older. XHANCE is the first and only drug therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. 
 We are relaunching XHANCE to focus on the comparatively larger market opportunity that we believe is created by the new indication. We plan to continue to focus our commercial efforts primarily to the ENT and allergy specialist audience while seeking partnerships to extend the commercialization of XHANCE into primary care. We realigned our 75 sales territories at the start of 2024 in order to optimize the chronic sinusitis prescribing potential within the called on specialist audience. As a result of the realignment and the new indication, approximately 40 of targets in the called on specialist audience are new to our territory managers. We completed training with our territory managers on new promotional materials during a national sales meeting the week of April 8, 2024 and deployed those to the field starting the week of April 15, 2024. In the second quarter of 2024, more than half of our territory manager sales calls were to targets who are new to our territory managers or have historically prescribed XHANCE infrequently. Successfully growing XHANCE prescribing in this audience, as well as our existing prescribing base, will be important to achieving our near and long term financial objectives. 
 In the first quarter of 2024 we launched a central in-take pharmacy model (commonly referred to as, a "Hub") to prepare for the growth we expect from XHANCE's new indication. In addition to offering the necessary scalability for our anticipated growth, we believe the Hub has the potential to provide improved protections for business continuity and more comprehensive and consistent patient support and prescription fulfillment services than our historical preferred pharmacy network. During the second quarter we transitioned a significant proportion of the XHANCE business from our historical preferred pharmacy network to the Hub. Although we may experience initial inefficiencies as a result of this transition, we believe we will begin to realize the benefits of the Hub model as we continue to optimize processes at the Hub and physician offices become familiar with working with the Hub. 
 In accordance with the Pediatric Research Equity Act, and as part of its approval of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps in patients 18 years of age and older, the FDA required that we conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group clinical study in children and adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of XHANCE using a Bayesian borrowing approach to evaluate efficacy in this population. We submitted our draft protocol to the FDA with respect to the pediatric study in March 2024 as required, and we are required to complete the study by March 2028 and submit a final report with respect to the study by October 2028. 
 26 

The medical community and payers generally use the terms "chronic sinusitis" and "chronic rhinosinusitis" interchangeably. FDA uses the term "chronic rhinosinusitis" and recognizes two distinct indications "chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps" and "chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps". It is our view that variations in terminology are synonymous from a promotional perspective. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we generally use the terms "chronic sinusitis" and "chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps" as being synonymous. 
 XHANCE Business Update 
 We track and report metrics that we believe are an important part of assessing our progress in key strategic areas including: 
 XHANCE Net Product Revenues per Prescription . We calculate average net product revenues per prescription, one metric that we use to gauge the profitability of XHANCE, by dividing net product revenues for the quarter by the estimated number of XHANCE prescriptions dispensed during the quarter. Average XHANCE net product revenues per prescription were 320 in the third quarter of 2024 which represents a 36 increase when compared to the 236 average XHANCE net product revenues per prescription in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in average net product revenues per prescription is partly the result of changes we made to our co-pay saving program intended to reduce the number of prescriptions filled by patients in commercial insurance plans that either do not cover XHANCE or are in commercial insurance plans that have high deductibles. In addition, part of the increase was the result of an increase in channel inventory associated in part with the addition of new pharmacies within the Hub network. In addition, we believe the disruption in services at Change Healthcare, the claims processor for our vendor that administers the XHANCE co-pay support program, hindered access to our co-pay benefit for uncovered patients. We believe this disruption had a favorable effect on XHANCE net revenue per prescription in the first quarter 2024, and was resolved in the second quarter 2024. 
 During the second half of 2023 we began to modify our co-pay assistance program to reduce the amount co-pay assistance available to patients that do not have coverage for XHANCE or have high out of pocket costs. These changes were intended to increase average net revenue per prescription by decreasing the amount we pay in co-pay assistance for these prescriptions and decreasing the number of these prescriptions that are filled because they have limited or no profitability. In the first quarter of 2024 we further reduced the amount of co-pay assistance available to patients that do not have coverage for XHANCE or have high out of pocket costs, which changes were designed to further increase average net revenue per prescription. 
 XHANCE Prescriptions . Based on third-party inventory and prescription data as well as data from our hub and PPN partners, the total estimated number of XHANCE prescriptions in the third quarter of 2024 was 63,900, which represents a 24 decrease for total prescriptions when compared to estimated third quarter 2023 prescriptions of 84,100. We believe the third quarter 2024 decrease in prescriptions was primarily driven by changes we made to our co-pay saving program intended to reduce the number of prescriptions filled by patients in commercial insurance plans that either do not cover XHANCE or are in commercial insurance plans that have high deductibles. 
 A seasonal effect has historically been observed in both the INS and XHANCE prescription markets in which market volume generally peaks near the middle of the second quarter and declines into the early part of the third quarter of each calendar year. 
 Although the underlying disease that we are treating is chronic and causes symptoms year-round, we believe the variation in patient flow through the offices of relevant physician specialists, and seasonality in disease flare-ups, has an impact on the number of patients that present themselves and who are therefore available to receive a new prescription for XHANCE. 
 Additionally, we believe that first quarter prescription demand and average net revenue per prescription for XHANCE is adversely impacted by the annual resetting of patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles and changes in individual patients' healthcare insurance coverage, both of which often occur in January. 
 XHANCE New and Refill Prescriptions . The underlying disease that we are treating is chronic and, as a result, many patients may fill multiple prescriptions per year. We monitor new prescriptions as they create the potential for future refill prescriptions. As noted above, we believe the third quarter 2024 decrease in prescriptions (including both new and refill prescriptions) was primarily driven by changes we made to our co-pay saving program intended to reduce the number of prescriptions filled by patients in commercial insurance plans that either do not cover XHANCE or are in commercial insurance plans that have high deductibles. Based on third-party inventory and prescription data as well as data from our hub and PPN 
 27 

partners, the total estimated number of XHANCE new prescriptions in the third quarter of 2024 was 25,600, which represents a 7 decrease for new prescriptions when compared to estimated third quarter 2023 new prescriptions of 27,400. We believe an inflection in new prescriptions occurred in September and continued through the week ended October 25 (which is the most recent week for which a full prescription data set was available prior to the filing of this Form 10-Q). The four-week moving average of weekly new prescriptions ranged between approximately 1,760 to 1,960 for the weeks ended June 28, 2024, through September 6, 2024. Following the inflection first observed in September, the moving average increased to approximately 2,300 to 2,500 NRx per week in October (through the week ended October 25) an increase of approximately 20 to 40 compared to the prior range. 

We track refill prescriptions and provide patient co-pay assistance to support refill programs that are administered by our hub and PPN partners. Based on third-party inventory and prescription data as well as data from our hub and PPN partners, the total estimated number of XHANCE refill prescriptions in the third quarter of 2024 was 38,200, which represents a 32 decrease for refill prescriptions when compared to estimated third quarter 2023 refill prescriptions of 56,600. 
 
 Prescribing Breadth and Depth . We track the number of physicians who prescribe XHANCE in a time period to evaluate the breadth of prescribing. We do not distinguish profitable and unprofitable prescribing in this metric. Based on third-party inventory and prescription data as well as data from our hub and PPN partners, the total estimated number of physicians who had at least one patient fill a prescription for XHANCE in the third quarter of 2024 was 8,548, which represents a 1 increase when compared to the estimated 8,427 physicians who had at least one patient fill a prescription for XHANCE in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, the total estimated number of physicians who had at least one patient fill a prescription for XHANCE was 8,478 in the fourth quarter of 2023, 8,451 in the first quarter of 2024, and 8,561 in the second quarter of 2024. 
 We also track the number of prescriptions filled by a prescribing physician's patients in a time period to evaluate depth of prescribing. We do not distinguish profitable and unprofitable prescribing in this metric. Based on third-party inventory and prescription data as well as data from our hub and PPN partners, the total estimated number of physicians who had more than 15 XHANCE prescriptions filled by their patients in the third quarter of 2024 was 1,056, which represents a 22 decrease when compared to the estimated 1,346 physicians who had more than 15 XHANCE prescriptions filled by their patients in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, the total estimated number of physicians who had more than 15 XHANCE prescriptions filled by their patients was 1,346 in the third quarter of 2023, 1,229 in the fourth quarter of 2023, 1,023 in the first quarter of 2024, and 1,056 in the second quarter of 2024. 
 28 

Market Access . We believe that as of September 30, 2024, approximately 70 of insured lives were in a plan that covers XHANCE. However, payors generally impose restrictions on access to or usage of XHANCE, such as by requiring prior authorizations or "step-edits". For example, insurers may require that a physician attest that they are treating a patient for an FDA-approved indication prior to becoming eligible for coverage for XHANCE. We believe that approximately half of commercial covered lives as of September 30, 2024 are in a plan that requires a prior authorization and most of those prior authorizations request information regarding both prior use of standard-delivery nasal steroid, and patient diagnosis for an indication for which XHANCE has been approved by the FDA. In some cases, patients do not meet the payors' utilization management criteria or the patient's healthcare provider may not complete the burdensome administrative process required to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom XHANCE has been prescribed meet the payors utilization management criteria (i.e., prior authorizations or step-edits) and, as a result, patients may not gain access to XHANCE treatment. The approval of XHANCE in March 2024 as a treatment for chronic sinusitis could make the prior authorization process easier for physicians to attest because chronic sinusitis is a more common clinical diagnosis and a diagnosis made by many types of physician, including those who do not have routine in-office ability to perform nasal endoscopy to ascertain the presence of nasal polyps. Payors can elect to change utilization management criteria to be more or less restrictive at any time, and changes in utilization management criteria or increasing rates of enforcement of utilization management criteria in the future could have a negative effect on prescription volume. 

Financial Operations Overview 
 The following discussion sets forth certain components of our consolidated statements of operations as well as factors that impact those items. 
 Net product revenues 
 Sales of XHANCE generated 20.4 million and 19.8 million in net product revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 55.8 million and 51.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In accordance with GAAP, we determine net product revenues for XHANCE, with specific assumptions for variable consideration components including but not limited to trade discounts and allowances, co-pay assistance programs and payor rebates. 
 Based on available XHANCE prescription data purchased from third parties and data from our hub and PPN partners, our average XHANCE net product revenues per prescription were 320 in the third quarter of 2024 which represents a 36 increase when compared to the 236 average XHANCE net product revenues per prescription in the third quarter of 2023. We believe the increase in average net product revenues per prescription is partly the result of changes we made to our co-pay saving program intended to reduce the number of prescriptions filled by patients in commercial insurance plans that either do not cover XHANCE or are in commercial insurance plans that have high deductibles. In addition, part of the increase was the result of an increase in channel inventory associated in part with the addition of new pharmacies within the Hub network. 
 We calculate average net product revenues per prescription, one metric that we use to gauge the profitability of XHANCE, by dividing net product revenues for the quarter by the estimated number of XHANCE prescriptions dispensed during the quarter. As a result, average net product revenues per prescription is subject to variability. That variability is impacted by factors that do not necessarily reflect a change in the price that is paid for an individual unit of XHANCE, including but not limited to ordering patterns and inventory levels for our wholesale customers, hub and PPN partners, patient utilization rates of our co-pay assistance and other affordability programs and the proportion of patients acquiring XHANCE through an insurance benefit. There is also the potential for variability that results from changes in estimation methodology by us and the third parties that we rely upon to provide certain prescription and inventory data which may lead to revisions of historical estimates of prescription volumes and our calculated average net product revenues per prescription. 
 29 

The lowering of the guidance range for full year 2024 XHANCE net revenues is the result of a slower than anticipated return to demand growth. As a result, we expect full year 2024 net product revenues will be between 75.0 to 79.0 million. Previously, we expected full year 2024 net product revenues to be between 85.0 to 90.0 million. The magnitude of the benefit derived as a result of the revisions that we made to our co-pay assistance program was greater than we expected in the first nine months of 2024, in addition, third quarter of 2024 benefited from additional channel inventory that included the stocking of new pharmacies within our Hub network. As a result, we believe average net product revenues per prescription will be approximately 270 for the full year of 2024. Previously, we believed that average net revenues per prescription would exceed 250. We expect full year 2024 operating expenses (consisting of selling, general administrative expenses and research development expenses) will be between 90.0 to 93.0 million, of which we expect non-cash stock-based compensation expense will be approximately 6.0 million. Previously, we expected full year 2024 operating expenses to be between 95.0 to 101.0 million, of which we expected non-cash stock-based compensation expense would be approximately 6.0 million. 
 Costs of product sales 
 Costs of product sales includes the cost of inventory sold, which includes direct and indirect manufacturing and supply chain costs. 
 Research and development expense 
 Research and development expense consists primarily of expenses incurred to prepare for, initiate and conduct our planned clinical trials, research efforts for new products and device improvements. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include: 
 personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; 
 costs of funding clinical development performed by third parties, including pursuant to agreements with contract research organizations (CROs), as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct or support our nonclinical studies and clinical trials; 
 expenses associated with the continued development of the Exhalation Delivery System; 
 expenses related to the continued development of our product portfolio; 
 expenses incurred under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), including manufacturing scale-up expenses prior to regulatory approval of products for commercial sale and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; 
 consultant fees and expenses associated with outsourced professional, scientific and development services; 
 expenses for regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies and costs incurred to compile and respond to filings with the FDA; and 
 allocated expenses for facility costs, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance. 
 We typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. Although we track certain outsourced development costs by product candidate, we do not allocate personnel costs or other internal costs to specific product candidates. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for employees in executive, finance, accounting, business development, information technology, legal and human resource functions. General and administrative expense also includes corporate facility costs, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance, not otherwise included in research and development expense, as well as regulatory fees and professional fees for legal, patent, accounting and other consulting services. 
 Sales and marketing expenses include our sales team and supporting promotional materials, digital promotion, peer-to-peer education, congresses / conventions, product samples, and marketing activities such as direct-to-patient / direct-to-consumer initiatives. Additionally, sales and marketing-related expenses include fees paid to our hub and PPN partners for services unrelated to traditional distribution functions, such as patient services fees, data fees, benefit claims adjudication and program management fees.

Warrant Liability 
 In November 2022, we issued warrants in connection with a public offering. These warrants are required to be measured at fair value and reported as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet. We recorded the fair value of the warrants upon issuance using a Monte Carlo simulation and are required to revalue the warrants at each reporting date with any changes in fair value recorded on our statement of operations. The valuation of the warrants is considered under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the need to use assumptions in the valuation that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. The change in the fair value of the Level 3 warrants liabilities is reflected in the statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Interest (income) expense 
 Interest (income) expense consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents held with institutional banks and interest expense is primarily related to the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes. 
 Other (income) expense 
 Other (income) expense consists primarily of unrealized gains and losses on our warrant liability, as well as foreign currency (income) losses due to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than our functional currency. 
 
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Comparison of three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Revenues: Net product revenues 20,437 19,823 Total revenues 20,437 19,823 Costs and expenses: Cost of product sales 2,065 2,225 Research and development 949 1,281 Selling, general and administrative 19,475 18,011 Total operating expenses 22,489 21,517 Loss from operations (2,052) (1,694) Other (income) expense: Interest expense, net 4,381 4,395 Other income (6,900) 3,205 Total other expense (income) (2,519) 7,600 Net income (loss) 467 (9,294) 
 Net product revenues 
 Net product revenues related to sales of XHANCE were 20.4 million and 19.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The year-over-year increase in net product revenues is attributable primarily to revisions that we made to our co-pay assistance program in the second half of 2023 as well as in January of 2024 intended to increase average net revenue per prescription. 
 Cost of product sales 
 Cost of product sales related to XHANCE were 2.1 million and 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 31 

Research and development expense 
 Research and development expense was 0.9 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 0.3 million decrease is attributable to a decrease in costs related to the preparation and filing of our supplemental new drug application for XHANCE for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expense was 19.5 million and 18.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 1.5 million increase was due primarily to an increase in sales and marketing costs related to our launch of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. 
 Interest (income) expense, net 
 Interest (income) expense, net, was 4.4 million and 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was primarily comprised of interest expense on the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes during both periods. 
 Other income 
 In November 2022, we issued warrants in connection with a public offering. These warrants are required to be measured at fair value and reported as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet. We recorded the fair value of the warrants upon issuance using a Monte Carlo simulation and are required to revalue the warrants at each reporting date with any changes in fair value recorded on our statement of operations. The valuation of the warrants is considered under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the need to use assumptions in the valuation that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. The change in the fair value of the Level 3 warrants liabilities is reflected in the statement of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other income includes primarily 6.9 million and 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively of unrealized gains on the fair value of warrants. 
 Comparison of nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Revenues: Net product revenues 55,807 51,122 Total revenues 55,807 51,122 Costs and expenses: Cost of product sales 5,277 6,502 Research and development 3,083 4,017 Selling, general and administrative 64,121 60,839 Total operating expenses 72,481 71,358 Loss from operations (16,674) (20,236) Other (income) expense: Interest (income) expense, net 13,194 12,461 Other income (8,687) (7,181) Total other expense 4,507 5,280 Net loss (21,181) (25,516) 
 Net product revenues 
 Net product revenues related to sales of XHANCE were 55.8 million and 51.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The year-over-year increase in net product revenues is attributable primarily to revisions that we made to our co-pay assistance program in the second half of 2023 as well as in January of 2024 intended to increase average net revenue per prescription. 
 32 

Cost of product sales 
 Cost of product sales related to XHANCE were 5.3 million and 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 1.2 million can be primarily attributed to an a lower number of units sold in 2024. 
 Research and development expense 
 Research and development expense was 3.1 million and 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 0.9 million decrease is attributable to a decrease in costs related to the preparation and filing of our supplemental new drug application for XHANCE for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expense was 64.1 million and 60.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 3.3 million increase was due primarily to an increase in sales and marketing costs related to our launch of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis, as well as higher stock based compensation expense in 2024, which was partially offset by 1.1 million of severance costs recognized in 2023. 
 Interest (income) expense, net 
 Interest (income) expense, net, was 13.2 million and 12.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was primarily comprised of interest expense on the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes during both periods. The increase was due primarily to higher interest rates in 2024. 
 Other income 
 In November 2022, we issued warrants in connection with a public offering. These warrants are required to be measured at fair value and reported as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet. We recorded the fair value of the warrants upon issuance using a Monte Carlo simulation and are required to revalue the warrants at each reporting date with any changes in fair value recorded on our statement of operations. The valuation of the warrants is considered under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the need to use assumptions in the valuation that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. The change in the fair value of the Level 3 warrants liabilities is reflected in the statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other income includes primarily 8.7 million and 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively of unrealized gains on the fair value of warrants. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since inception, we have incurred significant net losses and expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred net losses of 21.2 million and 25.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 741.6 million. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale and issuance of stock and debt, as well as through sales of XHANCE and licensing revenues. As of September 30, 2024, we had 82.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (46,552) (27,441) Net cash used in investing activities (72) (255) Net cash provided by financing activities 55,436 296 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 8,812 (27,400) 
 Operating activities 
 Cash used in operating activities increased by 19.1 million, from 27.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 46.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in cash used in operating activities was attributable to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory, as well as a decrease in 
 33 

accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by a smaller loss from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investing activities 
 Cash used in investing activities decreased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an decrease in equipment and software purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Financing activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the registered direct offering completed in May 2024. 
 Projected 2024 operating expenses 
 We expect that our total GAAP operating expenses (consisting of selling, general administrative expenses and research development expenses) for 2024 will be between 90 million and 93 million, of which approximately 6 million is expected to be stock-based compensation expense. As a result, our total operating expenses (consisting of selling, general administrative expenses and research development expenses) excluding approximately 6 million of expected stock-based compensation expense are expected to be between 84 million and 87 million. The 84 million to 87 million range is approximately a 4 million to 7 million increase compared to 2023. This increase is the result of additional selling, general, administrative expenses that we expect to incur in 2024 as we invest in the launch of XHANCE for the treatment of patients with chronic sinusitis. 
 Registered Direct Offering 
 
 On May 10, 2024, we completed a registered direct offering pursuant to which it issued an aggregate of 31,800,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of 1.00 per share and, in lieu of shares of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 23,700,000 shares of common stock at a price of 0.999 per prefunded warrant which represents the per share offering price for common stock less the 0.0001 per share exercise price for each such pre-funded warrant. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were 55.3 million. 
 A R Note Purchase Agreement 
 The principal balance of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes outstanding under the A R Note Purchase Agreement was 130,000 at September 30, 2024. See Note 8 of our unaudited consolidated financial statements for a description of terms of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes and A R Note Purchase Agreement, including repayment terms and applicable covenants. 
 
 Future funding requirements 
 We expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we: 
 continue advertising and other promotional activities to support the commercialization of XHANCE; 
 continue to provide co-pay and other patient affordability programs for XHANCE; 
 continue clinical development activities for XHANCE, including studies mandated under the Pediatric Research Equity Act; 
 evaluate product candidates; 
 continue to contract to manufacture XHANCE; 
 maintain and protect our patent portfolio; 
 service our debt obligations under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes; 
 maintain infrastructure necessary to operate as a publicly-traded, commercial-stage company; and 
 hire additional staff and add operational, financial and information systems to execute our business plan. 
 Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 34 

the success of our commercialization of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and chronic sinusitis including, among other things, continued patient and physician adoption of XHANCE and our ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement for XHANCE; 
 our clinical development plans for XHANCE, including the outcome, timing and cost of studies mandated under the Pediatric Research Equity Act; 
 the cost of commercialization activities for XHANCE, including product manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales; 
 net product revenues received from sales of XHANCE; 
 the level of co-pay assistance and other patient affordability programs offered for XHANCE; 
 the costs involved in preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and annuity fees relating to issued patents; 
 the cost of maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, as well as the cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us; 
 the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials and other research and development related to additional product candidates, 
 the extent to which we in-license, acquire or otherwise partner in development or commercialization of other products, product candidates or technologies; and 
 our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants (including the requirement for us to achieve certain minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties thresholds and the requirement for us to maintain at least a minimum level of cash and cash equivalents at all times), and the other provisions under the A R Note Purchase Agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024 we had 82.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the event we are able to maintain compliance with the financial covenants and terms of the A R Pharmakon Note Purchase Agreement or obtain a waiver to or modification of such covenants, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents would be sufficient to fund our operations and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, as discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, there is substantial doubt about our ability to maintain compliance with such financial covenants and terms of the A R Note Purchase Agreement and our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 We will likely require additional capital in the future secured through equity or debt financings, partnerships, collaborations, or other sources in order to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of the A R Note Purchase Agreement as discussed below, to meet our debt service obligations, including repayment of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes, and to carry out our planned development and commercial activities. If additional capital is not obtained when required, we may need to delay or curtail our operations until additional funding is received. 
 
 Our continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants (including the requirement for us to achieve certain minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties thresholds, the requirement for us to maintain at least 30.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at all times (reduced to 20.0 million following the date of the first quarterly payment of principal due on September 30, 2025), referred to as "the liquidity covenant", and the requirement that our annual and quarterly financial statements not be subject to any qualification or statement as to "going concern" commencing with our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025), and the other provisions under the A R Note Purchase Agreement, and our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our debt service obligations and to fund our operations and/or obtain additional capital through equity or debt financings, partnerships, collaborations, or other sources. The A R Note Purchase Agreement includes events of default, in certain cases subject to customary periods to cure, following which Pharmakon may accelerate all amounts outstanding pursuant to the A R Note Purchase Agreement. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. 
 
 The A R Note Purchase Agreement includes a requirement that we achieve certain minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties thresholds. We believe it is probable that we will not maintain compliance with the trailing twelve-month minimum consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties thresholds for the entire one year period after the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. If we fail to achieve a 
 35 

minimum consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties threshold, it will constitute a default under the A R Note Purchase Agreement if we are unable to obtain a modification or waiver of such minimum consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties threshold. 
 
 In the event of the foregoing default, the holders of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes may declare an event of default under the A R Note Purchase Agreement and may elect to accelerate the repayment of all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts due (which would also require us to pay an interest make-whole premium as specified in the A R Note Purchase Agreement if the repayment of the debt is accelerated prior to May 21, 2026). 
 
 Additionally, commencing on September 30, 2025, we will be required to begin making principal repayments on our debt in eight quarterly installments of 16.3 million each through maturity in June 2027. We believe it is probable that, absent additional capital, we will not be able to maintain compliance with the minimum cash covenant under the A R Note Purchase Agreement once we make the second principal repayment, which is due on December 31, 2025. 
 
 Our plans to seek to mitigate these default risks include enhancing our commercial performance to accelerate growth in net revenues, seeking out partnership and collaboration opportunities to expand the market for XHANCE, and, if required, requesting a modification or waiver of the covenants under the A R Note Purchase Agreement, or refinancing the debt. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in accelerating growth in net revenue, expanding the market for XHANCE, obtaining a modification or waiver of the covenants under the A R Note Purchase Agreement, or refinancing the debt. If we are unable to accelerate growth in net revenue, expand the market for XHANCE, obtain a modification or waiver of the covenants under the A R Note Purchase Agreement, and/or refinance the debt, we may need to delay or curtail its operations until we obtain additional capital which may not be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all, and such capital, if obtained, may not be sufficient to meet our payment obligations or enable us to continue to implement our long-term business strategy. In such an event, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the fair value for such assets or less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. Additionally, if we seek additional financing to fund our debt service obligations and business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide funding to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 
 Critical accounting policies 
 The Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024, have not materially changed.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 36 

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024. 
 
 We have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 82.5 million and have 130.0 million of outstanding Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes under the A R Note Purchase Agreement. Our accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 was 741.6 million. We have incurred significant net losses since inception and also expect to incur substantial losses in future periods. 
 
 Our continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants (including the requirement for us to achieve certain minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties thresholds, the requirement for us to maintain at least 30.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at all times (reduced to 20.0 million following the date of the first quarterly payment of principal due on September 30, 2025) and the requirement that commencing with our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025 that our annual and quarterly financial statements not be subject to any qualification or statement as to "going concern"), and the other provisions under the A R Note Purchase Agreement, and our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our debt service obligations and to fund our operations and/or obtain additional capital through equity or debt financings, partnerships, collaborations, or other sources. 
 
 The A R Note Purchase Agreement includes a requirement that we achieve certain minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties thresholds through maturity. We believe it is probable that we will not maintain compliance with the trailing twelve-month minimum consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties thresholds for the entire one year period after the filing of this Form 10-Q. If we fail to achieve a minimum consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties threshold, it will constitute a default under the A R Note Purchase Agreement if we are unable to obtain a modification or waiver of such minimum consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties threshold. 
 
 The A R Note Purchase Agreement also requires us to maintain at all times a minimum of 30.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, which will be reduced to 20.0 million following the date of the first quarterly payment of principal due on September 30, 2025 (referred to as, the "liquidity covenant"). If we are unable to secure additional capital through equity or debt financings, partnerships, collaborations, or other sources, we believe that it is probable that we will not be able to maintain compliance with the liquidity covenant under the A R Note Purchase Agreement once we make the second principal repayment, which is due on December 31, 2025, which will also constitute a default under the A R Note Purchase Agreement if we are unable to obtain a waiver or modification of such liquidity covenant. 
 
 Further, the A R Note Purchase Agreement includes a requirement that commencing with the report and opinion on our consolidated financial statements commencing with our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025 that all of our quarterly and annual financial statements, not be subject to any statement or qualification as to going concern (referred to as, the "going concern covenant"). As a general matter, financial statements are subject to a "going concern" uncertainty disclosure if it is probable that the company's available capital is not sufficient to fund its operations and obligations for at least twelve months following the issuance of such financial statements including obligations that could become due during such twelve month period as a result of some future event (for instance, the potential that the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes could become due if it is deemed probable that we will not maintain compliance with the covenants and other terms under the A R Note Purchase Agreement during such twelve month period). If we are unable to secure additional capital through equity or debt financings, partnerships, collaborations, or other sources, we believe it is unlikely that we will be able comply with the going concern covenant commencing with our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025, which will constitute a default under the A R Note Purchase Agreement if we are unable to obtain a modification or waiver of such going concern covenant. 
 38 

In the event of any of the foregoing defaults, the holders of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes may declare an event of default under the A R Note Purchase Agreement and may elect to accelerate the repayment of all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts due (which would also require us to pay an interest make-whole premium as specified in the A R Note Purchase Agreement if the repayment of the debt is accelerated prior to May 21, 2026), which may require us to delay or curtail our operations until we obtain additional capital which may not be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all, and such capital, if obtained, may not be sufficient to meet our payment obligations or enable us to continue to implement our long-term business strategy. In such an event, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the fair value for such assets or less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. Additionally, if we seek additional financing to fund our debt service obligations and business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide funding to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 

Our failure to comply with the covenants or other terms of the A R Note Purchase Agreement, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in a default under the A R Note Purchase Agreement that could materially and adversely affect the ongoing viability of our business. 
 
 Each holder of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes may elect to accelerate the repayment of all unpaid principal and accrued interest under such holders Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes upon consummation of a specified change of control transaction or occurrence of certain events of default (as specified in the A R Note Purchase Agreement), including, among other things: 
 our default in a payment obligation under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes; 
 our breach of the financial covenants, affirmative covenants, restrictive covenants or other terms of the A R Note Purchase Agreement, including (i) the trailing twelve-month minimum consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties covenant, (ii) the requirement to maintain at least 30.0 million of cash and cash equivalents (reduced to 20.0 million following the date of the first quarterly payment of principal due on September 30, 2025) and (iii) the requirement to deliver quarterly and annual financial statements that, commencing with the fiscal period ending December 31, 2025, are not subject to a "going concern" statement or qualification; 
 our breach of reporting obligations; 
 our failure to properly maintain the collateral; 
 any circumstance that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect (as defined in the A R Note Purchase Agreement) on us; 
 certain regulatory and/or commercial actions that cause an ongoing delay in commercialization of XHANCE; and 
 certain specified insolvency and bankruptcy-related events. 
 Subject to any applicable cure period set forth in the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes, all amounts outstanding with respect to the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes (principal and accrued interest), as well as any applicable interest make-whole payments, would become due and payable immediately upon an event of default and shall be subject to a default interest rate of an additional 3 . Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay our obligations under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes if the obligations thereunder are accelerated upon any events of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our obligations under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes, or obtain a waiver or modification to the financial covenants or any other terms under the A R Note Purchase Agreement as may be required in the future, the holders of such Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes could proceed to protect and enforce their rights under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes by exercising such remedies (including foreclosure on the assets securing our obligations under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes and the A R Note Purchase Agreement) as are available to the holders thereunder and in respect thereof under applicable law, either by suit in equity or by action at law, or both, whether for specific performance of any covenant or other agreement contained in the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes. Any such action would materially and adversely affect the ongoing viability of our business.

In the event that we maintain compliance with the trailing twelve-month minimum consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties that we are required to meet each quarter, maintain at least 30.0 million of cash and cash equivalents (reduced to 20.0 million following the date of the first quarterly payment of principal due on September 30, 2025) and deliver quarterly and annual financial statements that, commencing with the fiscal period ending December 31, 2025, are not subject to a "going concern" statement or qualification, and maintain compliance with all other terms of the A R Note Purchase Agreement, in each case, to avoid an acceleration of payments due under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes, then we will be required to repay the notes in eight equal quarterly payments of 16.25 million starting on September 30, 2025. The Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries and are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our and their assets. 
 
 We are required to achieve the following minimum trailing twelve-month XHANCE net sales and royalties under the A R Note Purchase Agreement (in thousands): 
 
 Trailing Twelve-Months Ending As Revised Pursuant to Second Amendment March 31, 2024 70,000 June 30, 2024 70,000 September 30, 2024 72,500 December 31, 2024 75,000 March 31, 2025 80,000 June 30, 2025 87,500 September 30, 2025 95,000 December 31, 2025 105,500 March 31, 2026 120,000 June 30, 2026 130,000 September 30, 2026 145,000 December 31, 2026 150,000 March 31, 2027 155,000 June 30, 2027 160,000 

We could be delisted from Nasdaq, which would harm the liquidity of our stock and our ability to raise capital, and may cause the market price of our stock to decline. 
 
 Nasdaq requires listing issuers to comply with certain standards in order to remain listed on its exchange. On October 16, 2024, we were notified (the Notice by Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq that on October 16, 2024, the average closing price of our common stock over the prior 30 consecutive trading days had fallen below 1.00 per share, which is the minimum average closing price required to maintain listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Requirement ). Nasdaq s notice had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our common stock. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we are provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days prior to the deadline. If we do not achieve compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement within 180 calendar days, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar days to regain compliance. To qualify, we would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other Nasdaq initial listing standards, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Requirement, and provide written notice of our intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during the second compliance period. 
 
 If the Nasdaq staff determines that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are otherwise not eligible for such additional compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting. In the event we receive notice that our common stock is being delisted, Nasdaq rules permit us to appeal any delisting determination by the Nasdaq staff. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement or maintain compliance with the other listing requirements. 
 
 40 

If, for any reason, Nasdaq were to delist our securities from trading on its exchange and we are unable to obtain listing on another reputable national securities exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could materially adversely affect our stockholders: 
 liquidity and marketability of our common stock; 
 our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations; 
 the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in our common stock; 
 the number of market makers in our common stock; 
 the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock; and 
 the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock 
 In addition, if we cease to be eligible to trade on Nasdaq, we may have to pursue trading on a less recognized or accepted market, such as the over the counter markets, our stock may be traded as a penny stock which would make transactions in our stock more difficult and cumbersome, and we may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all, as companies trading on alternative markets may be viewed as less attractive investments with higher associated risks, such that existing or prospective institutional investors may be less interested in, or prohibited from, investing in our common stock. This may also cause the market price of our common stock to further decline.
