 Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis (MD A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of W.W. Grainger, Inc. (Grainger or Company) as it is viewed by management of the Company. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K and the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Percentage figures included in this section have not been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or in the associated text. 
 
 Overview 
 Grainger is a broad line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the U.K. Grainger uses a combination of its high-touch solutions and endless assortment businesses to serve its customers worldwide, which rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations. 
 
 Strategic Priorities 
 For a discussion of the Company s strategic priorities for 2024, see Part 1, Item 1: Business and Part II, Item 7: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Recent Events 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 The global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty including to the commodity, labor and transportation markets, arising from a combination of geopolitical conditions and events, and various economic and financial factors. These conditions have affected the Company's operations and may continue to affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company continues to monitor economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, and the impact of macroeconomic pressures, including repercussions from changes in interest rates, currency exchange fluctuations, changing inflationary environment, and a potential recession on the Company s business, customers, suppliers and other third parties. The Company has implemented strategies designed to mitigate certain adverse effects from the impact of the changing inflationary environment while remaining market price competitive. Historically, the Company s broad and diverse customer base and the nondiscretionary nature of the Company s products to its customers has helped to insulate it from the effects of recessionary periods in the industrial MRO market. The full extent and impact of these conditions are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. 
 
 For further discussion of the Company's risks and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 Grainger utilizes non-GAAP measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. Non-GAAP measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating resul ts. The Company adjusts its reported net sales when there are differences in the number of U.S. selling days relative to the prior year period and also excludes the impact on reported net sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and results of certain divested businesses. This includes the net sales results of E R divested in the fourth quarter of 2023 previously reported in the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment. Adjusted results including adjusted SG A, adjusted operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS exclude certain non-recurring items, including restructuring charges, asset impairments, gains and losses associated with business divestitures and other non-recurring, infrequent or unusual gains and losses from the Company s most directly comparable reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) results. The Company believes its non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its businesses by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating results. Grainger s non-GAAP finan cial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Grainger believes its current balances of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to invest in its business and return excess cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, which it plans to fund through cash flows generated from operations. Grainger also maintains access to capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Grainger had cash and cash equivalents of 1,448 million and 660 million, respectively. The Company had approximately 2.7 billion in available liquidity as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table shows the Company's cash flow activity for the periods presented (in millions of dollars): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,683 1,427 Investing activities (262) (307) Financing activities (615) (839) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (18) (5) Increase in cash and cash equivalents 788 276 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 1,683 million and 1,427 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven by favorable changes in working capital primarily due to decreased accounts receivable driven by value added services compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 262 million and 307 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was due to timing of capital expenditures driven by U.S. supply chain investments in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 615 million and 839 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt, which includes 500 million in unsecured senior notes partially offset by higher treasury stock repurchases in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Working Capital 
 Working capital as of September 30, 2024 was 3,112 million, an increase of 34 million compared to 3,078 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the ratio of curre nt assets to current liabilities was 2.7 and 2.8, respectively. 
 
 Debt 
 Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. Grainger has various sources of financing available. 
 
 Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 41.9 and 40.1 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of Grainger s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are in conformity with GAAP and the Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company s management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts. The Company considers an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) it involves assumptions that are uncertain when judgment was applied, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on Grainger s consolidated financial position and results. While the Company believes the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable, the Company s management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 From time to time in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as in other written reports, communications and verbal statements, Grainger makes forward-looking statements that are not historical in nature but concern forecasts of future results, business plans, analyses, prospects, strategies, objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws.

 This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the Securities ), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of June 11, 2015, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association as trustee, as supplemented by a Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 12, 2024, between the Company and the U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association (herein called the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture) (collectively, the Indenture ), to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to 500,000,000.

 100 of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed, 
 plus , in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the Redemption 
 Date. 
 
 On or after the Par Call Date, the Securities are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a Redemption Price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.

 The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Company after 4 15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of 

Governors of the Federal Reserve System), on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as Selected Interest Rates (Daily) - H.15 (or any successor designation or publication) H.15 under the caption U.S. government securities Treasury constant maturities Nominal (or any successor caption or heading) H.15 TCM ). In determining the Treasury Rate, the Company shall select, as applicable (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the Redemption Date to the Par Call Date (the Remaining Life or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life, the two yields one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life and shall interpolate to the Par Call Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life, the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life.

The limitations are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions.
