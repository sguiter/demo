and a working capital deficit of . During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company used of cash in operations and incurred a net loss of , resulting in an accumulated deficit
of . 

Any
additional capital that the Company may raise through the sale of equity or equity-backed securities may dilute current stockholders 
ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of AiAdvertising equity securities. The terms of the
securities issued by the Company in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include preferences, superior
voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities which may have a further dilutive effect. Furthermore, any
additional debt or equity or other financing that we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If the Company
is unable to obtain additional capital, the Company may have to curtail its growth plans or cut back on existing business. Further, the
Company may not be able to continue operations if AiAdvertising does not generate sufficient revenues from operations. The Company may
incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities
law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. The Company may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses
in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our reported financial
results. 

The
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity
of operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company
historically does not generate significant revenues, and has negative cash flows from operations, which raises substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and appropriateness
of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital. There is no assurance that the Company
can obtain capital on terms that are acceptable, or at all, to the Company.

Because the Company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

25 

Financing Activities 

Cash flow provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,499,999 which was from the proceeds of 2,500,000 from the sale of preferred
stock. Cash flow provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as 5,599,400. This was from the proceeds
from the issuance of preferred stock of 5,000,000 and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 599,427. 

As of September 30, 2024, the
Company had cash of 630 and a working capital deficit of 1,882,197. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used
 2,609,405 of cash in operations and incurred a net loss of 4,310,811, resulting in an accumulated deficit of ay 64,435,843. 

Any additional capital that the
Company may raise through the sale of equity or equity-backed securities may dilute current stockholders ownership percentages
and could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of AiAdvertising equity securities. The terms of the securities issued by
the Company in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include preferences, superior voting rights
and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities which may have a further dilutive effect. Furthermore, any additional debt
or equity or other financing that we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional
capital, we may have to curtail our growth plans or cut back on existing business. Further, we may not be able to continue operations
if AiAdvertising does not generate sufficient revenues from operations. The Company may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital
financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses
and other costs. The Company may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such
as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our reported financial results. 

The accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements do not
reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company historically does not generate
significant revenues, and has negative cash flows from operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and appropriateness of using the going concern
basis is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital. There is no assurance that the Company can obtain capital on
terms that are acceptable, or at all, to the Company.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not required for smaller reporting
companies. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management, with the participation
of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses. 

Changes in Internal Controls
over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

The Company s management
does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all
fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by
the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or management override of the controls. The design of any system
of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness
to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
