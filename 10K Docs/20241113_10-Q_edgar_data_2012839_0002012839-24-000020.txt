 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions and our assumptions. We are externally managed by the Adviser, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ), and a subsidiary of KKR Co. Inc. (together with the Adviser and its other affiliates, KKR ). Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, potential, predicts, and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including: 
 our future operating results; 
 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 
 risk associated with possible disruptions in our operations or the economy generally; 
 changes in the general interest rate environment; 
 general economic, political and industry trends and other external factors, including uncertainty surrounding 
 the financial and political stability of the United States and other countries; 
 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 actual and potential conflicts of interest with our Adviser and its affiliates; 
 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we invest; 
 the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 
 the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments; 
 the adequacy of our financing sources and working capital; 
 the timing and amount of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; 
 the ability of our Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 
 the ability of our Adviser and its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 
 our ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a BDC and as a RIC under the Code; 
 the impact on our business of U.S. and international financial reform legislation, rules and regulations; 
 the effect of changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations thereof. 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statements in

this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. This report contains forward-looking statements, which may relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described or identified in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we make directly to you or through reports that we may file with the SEC in the future, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. 
 
 Overview 
 We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We are externally managed by the Adviser, which manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory and administrative services pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. We were formed as a Delaware statutory trust on December 22, 2023 and converted into a Delaware corporation on April 19, 2024. After the conversion, we also elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. 
 
 The Adviser oversees (subject to the oversight of the Board, a majority of whom are Independent Directors) the management of our operations and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to our portfolio pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. For the services it provides to us, the Adviser receives an annual fee, payable monthly by us, in an amount equal to 1.25 of our month end net assets. The Adviser has agreed to reduce its management fee to an annual rate of 0.00 of our month end net assets. The Management Fee Waiver will remain in effect through at least December 31, 2025, though the Adviser does not currently intend to terminate the Management Fee Waiver after that date. After December 31, 2025, the Management Fee Waiver may be terminated only upon 60 days notice by the Board or the Adviser. 
 
 We expect to conduct the continuous Private Offering of our Common Shares in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, Regulation S under the Securities Act and other exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and is expected to vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle-market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 Revenues 
 
 We plan to principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold, as well as dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we hold. In addition, we plan to generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses will include interest expense from financing arrangements and other indebtedness and other expenses necessary for our operations. The Adviser has agreed to waive its Management Fee through at least December 31, 2025. See Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 4 - Agreements and Related Party Transactions for additional information.

Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 Our investment income for the three months ended and the period ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 For the Period Ended September 30, 2024 Amount Percentage of Total Income Amount Percentage of Total Income Interest income 16,208 89.5 26,931 90.2 Fee income 1,904 10.5 2,914 9.8 Total investment income 18,112 100.0 29,845 100.0 
 The level of interest income and other income we received was primarily driven by our deployment of capital. We expect the dollar amount of interest that we earn to increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases. 
 Expenses 
 Our operating expenses for the three months ended and the period ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 For the Period Ended September 30, 2024 Interest expense 6,425 10,990 Management fee 982 1,600 Professional fees 416 842 Administration and custody fees 81 145 Directors fees 18 37 Other expenses 118 126 Total operating expenses 8,040 13,740 Less: Fees waived by the Adviser (982) (1,600) Net operating expenses 7,058 12,140 
 Interest expense, among other things, is the main driver of net operating expenses, which may increase or decrease depending on investment activities, changes in amounts outstanding under our financing arrangement and benchmark interest rates such as SOFR, among other factors. 
 Net Investment Income 
 Our net investment income totaled 11,054 for the period ended September 30, 2024. Our net investment income during the period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributed to interest and fee income, which is offset by the interest expense discussed above. 
 Net Realized Gains or Losses 
 Our net realized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency for the three months ended and the period ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 For the Period Ended September 30, 2024 Net realized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currencies 271 360 Total net realized gains (losses) 271 360 
 Our realized gains (losses) on investments were derived from the acceleration of OID from repayment activities. There was no sale activity for the period ended September 30, 2024. 
 29 

Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 Our net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and foreign currency for the three months ended and the period ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 For the Period Ended September 30, 2024 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and foreign currencies 488 7,599 Benefit (provision) for income taxes 28 (1,018) Total net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) 516 6,581 
 Our net change in unrealized appreciation in our investments for the period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to appreciation in market value of several specific assets in the portfolio, offset by a provision for income taxes of 1,018 that was derived from a transaction prior to our conversion from a statutory trust to a corporation and election to be treated as a business development company and subsequent activities. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We intend to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds from the Private Offering and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of the Private Offering. Our primary use of cash will be investments in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses, payment of cash distributions to our shareholders and repurchases of our Common Shares under our share repurchase program. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had received capital subscriptions of 326,652 from the investors in the Private Offering. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 14,466 in cash and cash equivalents, which we held in custodial accounts and money market fund accounts with financial institutions. As of September 30, 2024, we had aggregate unfunded commitments of 201,886. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise. 
 Financing Arrangements 
 
 We intend to utilize leverage to finance our investments. The amount of leverage that we employ will be subject to the restrictions of the 1940 Act and the supervision of our Board of Directors. At the time of any proposed borrowing, the amount of leverage we employ will also depend on our Adviser s assessment of market and other factors. 
 
 We intend to establish one or more credit facilities or enter into other financing arrangements to facilitate investments and the timely payment of our expenses. It is anticipated that any such credit facilities will bear interest at floating rates at to-be-determined spreads over a specified reference rate. We cannot assure shareholders that we will be able to enter into a credit facility on favorable terms or at all. In connection with a credit facility or other borrowings, lenders may require us to pledge assets (and the ability to enforce the payment thereof) and may ask to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. 
 
 On April 1, 2024, KKR Enhanced US EVDL Funding LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into the Citibank Credit Facility with Citibank, N.A., as lender, to borrow up to 500.0 million, with options to increase the financing commitment up to 1.25 billion. In the absence of any events of default, the borrowing and repayment period will terminate on April 1, 2027. Subsequent to this period, outstanding borrowings are subject to periodic mandatory repayments through the final maturity date of March 30, 2029.

The following table presents summary information with respect to our outstanding financing arrangements as of September 30, 2024: 
 September 30, 2024 Debt Obligations Type of Debt Rate Amount Outstanding (2)

 ____________ 
 (1) The carrying amount outstanding under the facility approximates its fair value. 
 (2) Amount includes borrowings in GBP and EUR, which have been converted to U.S dollars at exchange rates as of September 30, 2024 to reflect total amount outstanding in U.S. dollars. 
 See Note 7 - Debt Obligations to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our debt obligations. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Subsequent events after the reporting date have been evaluated through the date the unaudited consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. Other than the item discussed below, we have concluded that there is no impact requiring adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements. 
 On October 7, 2024, KKR Enhanced US EVDL Funding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of us, entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Citibank Credit Facility, amending the spread from 2.65 to 2.15 . 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management utilizes available information, which includes our history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in the notes to our financial statements. 
 
 Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We will evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. We have identified one of our accounting policies, valuation of portfolio investments, specifically the valuation of Level 3 investments, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 We are required to report our investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. We value our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 ), which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on how we value our investments. 
 31 

Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into certain contracts under which we may have material future commitments. We have entered into each of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement with the Adviser to provide us with investment advisory services and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the Investment Advisory Agreement and reimbursements made under the Administration Agreement. If any of our contractual obligations are terminated, our costs may increase under any new agreements that we enter into as replacements. We would also likely incur expenses in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement. 
 Under our organizational documents, our officers and Directors are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to us. In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations that provide general indemnifications. Our maximum liability exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as future claims that have not yet occurred may be made against us. However, based on experience, we expect the risk of loss to be remote. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. 
 
 We may become a party to investment commitments and to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to fund investments and to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, we believed that we had adequate financial resources to satisfy our unfunded commitments of 201,886 . 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to any variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. However, many of our variable rate investments provide for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our interest income from increasing until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold amount. A rise in interest rates would also be expected to lead to higher cost on our floating rate borrowings. 
 The following table shows the effect over a twelve-month period of changes in interest rates on our interest income, interest expense and net interest income assuming no changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, including the accrual status of our investments, and our financing arrangements in effect as of September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts are presented in thousands):

 _______________ 
 
 (1) Assumes no defaults or prepayments by portfolio companies over the next twelve months. 
 (2) Assumes current debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and no changes over the next twelve months. 
 We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During the period ended September 30, 2024, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency that are subject to the effects of exchange rate movements between the foreign currency of each such investment and the U.S. dollar, which may affect future fair values and cash flows, as well as amounts translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. We may use derivative instruments from time to time, including foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps, to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, we may have the ability to borrow in foreign currencies under any credit facilities or enter into other financing arrangements, which provides a natural hedge with regard to changes in exchange rates between the foreign currencies and U.S. dollar and reduces our exposure to foreign exchange rate differences. We expect to typically be a net receiver of these foreign currencies as related for our international investment positions, and, as a result, our investments denominated in foreign currencies, to the extent not hedged, are expected to benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. 
 Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that we would meet our disclosure obligations. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 33 

Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Neither we, the Adviser, nor our subsidiaries are currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our businesses. We, the Adviser, and our subsidiaries may from time to time, however, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do not expect any current matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Before making a decision to transact in our Common Shares, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Form 10, and all other information set forth in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results, as well as the NAV of our Common Shares. The risks described in the Form 10 are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results, as well as the NAV of our Common Shares. 
 There have been no material changes since the filing of the Amendment No.2 to Form 10 with the SEC on June 4, 2024 to the risk factors previously disclosed therein. If any of the identified risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the NAV of our Common Shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities 
 During the period ended September 30, 2024, we issued and sold an aggregate of 321,535 Common Shares pursuant to the subscription agreement entered into by and between KKR Enhanced US Direct Lending Fund-L Holdings L.P. (the Subscriber and us. As of September 30, 2024, the Subscriber holds all of the outstanding Common Shares issued by us and was our only shareholder. The Common Share was issued and sold in reliance upon the available exemptions from registration requirements of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
