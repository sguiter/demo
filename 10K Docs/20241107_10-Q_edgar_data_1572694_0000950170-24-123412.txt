 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDIN G FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, expect, anticipate, project, target, estimate, intend, continue or believe or the negatives of, or other variations on, these terms or comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations concerning our business, operating results, financial condition and other similar matters. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors. Our forward-looking statements include information in this report regarding general domestic and global economic conditions, our future financing plans, our ability to operate as a business development company BDC and the expected performance of, and the yield on, our portfolio companies. There may be events in the future, however, that we are not able to predict accurately or control. The factors listed under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as any cautionary language in this report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date of this report. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this quarterly report because we are an investment company. The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements:

disruptions in the capital markets, market conditions, and general economic uncertainty;

Accelerated amortization of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts 

Fees received from portfolio companies (directors fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) are paid to the Company, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, the Company only receives its allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as another Account (as defined below) managed by the Investment Adviser. Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any. Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind PIK interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the principal amount or shares (if equity) of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon the investment being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income. Certain structuring fees, amendment fees, syndication fees and commitment fees are recorded as other income when earned. Administrative agent fees received by the Company are recorded as other income when the services are rendered over time.

The Purchase Discount allocated to equity investments acquired is not amortized over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company will recognize a realized gain with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.

per quarter) of the average of the values of the Company s gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The Management Fee for any partial quarter will be appropriately prorated. The Investment Adviser waives a portion of its management fee payable by the Company in an amount equal to the management fees it earns as an investment adviser for any affiliated money market funds in which the Company invests. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Management Fees amounted to and . As of September 30, 2024, remained payable. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Management Fees amounted to and . Incentive Fee The incentive fee (the Incentive Fee consists of components that are determined independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. The Incentive Fee is calculated as follows: A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on income and a portion is based on capital gains, each as described below. The Investment Adviser is entitled to receive the Incentive Fee based on income if Ordinary Income (as defined below) exceeds a quarterly hurdle rate of . For this purpose, the hurdle is computed by reference to the Company s NAV and does not take into account changes in the market price of the Company s common stock. The Incentive Fee based on income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter by reference to the Company s aggregate net investment income, as adjusted as described below, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (such period the Trailing Twelve Quarters ). The Incentive Fee based on capital gains is determined and paid annually in arrears at the end of each calendar year by reference to an Annual Period, which means the period beginning on January 1 of each calendar year and ending on December 31 of such calendar year or, in the case of the first and last year, the appropriate portion thereof. The hurdle amount for the Incentive Fee based on income is determined on a quarterly basis and is equal to multiplied by the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments for subscriptions (which includes all of the Company s issuances of shares of its common stock, including issuances pursuant to its DRIP) and distributions that occurred during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Incentive Fee for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. i. Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Income For the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income, the Company pays the Investment Adviser a quarterly Incentive Fee based on the amount by which (A) aggregate net investment income Ordinary Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (B) the hurdle amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve

 Incentive Fee based on income is payable to the Investment Adviser for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount; 

 of the Ordinary Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle amount, but is less than or equal to an amount, referred to as the Catch-up Amount, determined as the sum of multiplied by the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income; and 

 of the Ordinary Income that exceeds the Catch-up Amount is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income. 

 The amount of the Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter equals the excess of the Incentive Fee so calculated minus the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters but not in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap (as described below). The Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter is subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ). The Incentive Fee Cap for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (b) the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. Cumulative Net Return means (x) the Ordinary Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company pays no Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to the Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company pays an Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to the Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company pays an Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap. Net Capital Loss in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Incentive Fees based on income amounted to and . As of September 30, 2024, remained payable. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Incentive Fees based on income amounted to and , and the Investment Adviser voluntarily agreed to waive and of such Incentive Fees. ii. Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains The portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is calculated on an annual basis. For each Annual Period, the Company pays the Investment Adviser an amount equal to (A) of the difference, if positive, of the sum of the Company s aggregate realized capital gains, if any, computed net of the Company s aggregate realized capital losses, if any, and the Company s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, in each case from April 1, 2013 until the end of such Annual Period minus (B) the cumulative amount of Incentive Fees based on capital gains previously paid to the Investment Adviser from April 1, 2013. For the avoidance of doubt, unrealized capital appreciation is excluded from the calculation in clause (A) above. The Company accrues, but does not pay, a portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains with respect to net unrealized appreciation. Under GAAP, the Company is required to accrue an Incentive Fee based on capital gains that includes net realized capital gains and losses and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the accrual for the Incentive Fee based on capital gains, the Company considers the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, since an Incentive Fee based on capital gains would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative net realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then the Company records a capital gains incentive fee equal to of such amount, minus the aggregate amount of actual Incentive Fees based on capital gains paid in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future.

Purchases under the 2022 10b5-1 Plan were required to be conducted on a programmatic basis in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act and other applicable securities laws. Any repurchase by the Company of its common stock under any 10b5-1 plan or otherwise may result in the price of the Company s common stock being higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market.

 and included within Accrued expenses and other liabilities that were paid by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates on behalf of the Company. Co-investment Activity In certain circumstances, the Company can make negotiated co-investments pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to do so. On November 16, 2022, the SEC granted to the Investment Adviser, the BDCs advised by the Investment Adviser and certain other affiliated applicants exemptive relief on which the Company expects to rely to co-invest alongside certain other client accounts managed by the Investment Adviser (collectively with the Company, the Accounts ), which may include proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs, in a manner consistent with the Company's investment objectives and strategies, certain Board-established criteria, the conditions of such exemptive relief and other pertinent factors (as amended, the Relief ). On June 25, 2024, the SEC granted an amendment to the Relief, which permits the Company to participate in follow-on investments in the Company's existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates covered by the Relief if such affiliates, that are not BDCs or registered investment companies, have an investment in such existing portfolio company. Additionally, if the Investment Adviser forms other funds in the future, the Company may co-invest alongside such other affiliates, subject to compliance with the Relief, applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. As a result of the Relief, there could be significant overlap in the Company s investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of other Accounts, including, in some cases, proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs. The Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit Team is composed of investment professionals dedicated to the Company s investment strategy and to other funds that share a similar investment strategy with the Company. The Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit Team is responsible for identifying investment opportunities, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments, negotiating and structuring the Company s investments and monitoring and servicing the Company s investments. The team works together with investment professionals who are primarily focused on investment strategies in syndicated, liquid credit. Under the terms of the Relief, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act) of the Company s independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to the Company and the Company s stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s stockholders and is consistent with the then-current investment objectives and strategies of the Company.

 These ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of instrument, but they do not represent a range of values for any one instrument. For example, the lowest discount rate in 1st Lien/Senior Secured Debt is appropriate for valuing that specific debt investment, but may not be appropriate for valuing any other debt investments in this asset class. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs presented below do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of the Company s Level 3 assets.

As a result, if the Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. The shares distributed by the Transfer Agent in the Company s DRIP are either through (i) newly issued shares or (ii) acquired by the Transfer Agent through the purchase of outstanding shares on the open market. If, on the payment date for any distribution, the most recently computed NAV per share as of the DRIP is equal to or less than the closing market price plus estimated per share fees, the Transfer Agent will invest the distribution amount in newly issued shares. Otherwise, the Transfer Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares acquired by purchasing shares on the open market.

The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with this discussion and analysis. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We are a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). In addition, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC ), and we expect to qualify annually for tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. From our formation in 2012 through September 30, 2024, we originated approximately 8.51 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt and equity investments prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien, unitranche debt, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments. 
 Unitranche loans are first lien loans that extend deeper in a borrower s capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority between different lenders in such loan. In a number of instances, we may find another lender to provide the first-out portion of a unitranche loan while we retain the last-out portion of such loan, in which case, the first-out portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to the payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder as compared to the last-out portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for taking greater risk of loss, the last-out portion generally earns a higher interest rate than the first-out portion of the loan. We use the term mezzanine to refer to debt that ranks senior in right of payment only to a borrower s equity securities and ranks junior in right of payment to all of such borrower s other indebtedness. We may make multiple investments in the same portfolio company. 
 We may also originate covenant-lite loans, which are loans with fewer financial maintenance covenants than other obligations, or no financial maintenance covenants. Such covenant-lite loans may not include terms that allow the lender to monitor the performance of the borrower or to declare a default if certain criteria are breached. These flexible covenants (or the absence of covenants) could permit borrowers to experience a significant downturn in their results of operations without triggering any default that would permit holders of their debt (such as us) to accelerate indebtedness or negotiate terms and pricing. In the event of default, covenant-lite loans may recover less value than traditional loans as the lender may not have an opportunity to negotiate with the borrower prior to such default. 
 We invest primarily in U.S. middle-market companies, which we believe are underserved by traditional providers of capital such as banks and the public debt markets. In this report, we generally use the term middle market companies to refer to companies with between 5 million and 200 million of annual earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization EBITDA excluding certain one-time, and non-recurring items that are outside the operations of these companies. However, we may from time to time invest in larger or smaller companies. We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from various loan origination and other fees, dividends on direct equity investments and capital gains on the sales of investments. Fees received from portfolio companies (directors fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) are paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief therefrom, we only receive our allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as another client account managed by our Investment Adviser (collectively with us, the Accounts ). The companies in which we invest use our capital for a variety of purposes, including to support organic growth, fund acquisitions, make capital investments or refinance indebtedness. 
 Our origination strategy focuses on leading the negotiation and structuring of the loans or securities in which we invest and holding the investments in our portfolio to maturity. In many cases, we are the sole investor in the loan or security in our portfolio. Where there are multiple investors, we generally seek to control or obtain significant influence over the rights of investors in the loan or security. We generally seek to make investments that have maturities between three and ten years and range in size between 10 million and 75 million, although we may make larger or smaller investments on occasion. 
 For a discussion of the competitive landscape we face, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Competition We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and Item 1. Business Competitive Advantage s in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 KEY COMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the Investment Company Act, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), eligible portfolio companies include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind PIK income. The principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. 
 We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring, syndication, exit fees or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Portfolio company fees (directors fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) will be paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, we receive our allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as other Accounts, which other Accounts could receive their allocable portion of such fee. We do not expect to receive material fee income as it is not our principal investment strategy. We record contractual prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee (the Management Fee and the incentive fee (the Incentive Fee to our Investment Adviser, legal and professional fees, interest and other debt expenses and other operating and overhead related expenses. The Management Fee and Incentive Fee compensate our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions in accordance with the investment management agreement (the Investment Management Agreement and administration agreement (the Administration Agreement ), including: 
 
 our operational expenses; 

fees and expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Investment Adviser or payable to third parties related to our investments, including, among others, professional fees (including the fees of consultants and experts) and fees and expenses from evaluating, monitoring, researching and performing due diligence on investments and prospective investments; 

interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; 

fees and expenses incurred by us in connection with membership in investment company organizations; 

brokers commissions; 

the expenses of and fees for registering or qualifying our shares for sale and of maintaining our registration and registering us as a broker or a dealer; 

fees and expenses associated with calculating our net asset value NAV (including expenses of any independent valuation firm); 

legal, auditing or accounting expenses; 

taxes or governmental fees; 

the fees and expenses of our administrator, transfer agent or sub-transfer agent; 

the cost of preparing stock certificates, including clerical expenses of issue, redemption or repurchase of our shares; 

the fees and expenses of our directors who are not affiliated with our Investment Adviser; 

the cost of preparing and distributing reports, proxy statements and notices to our stockholders, the SEC and other regulatory authorities; 

costs of holding stockholder meetings;

insurance premiums; and 

costs incurred in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration, mediation, government investigation or dispute in connection with our business and the amount of any judgment or settlement paid in connection therewith, or the enforcement of our rights against any person and indemnification or contribution expenses payable by us to any person and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of our business. 

We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. Costs relating to future offerings of securities would be incremental. 
 Leverage 
 Our senior secured revolving credit agreement (as amended, the Revolving Credit Facility with Truist Bank, as administrative agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, our 3.75 Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes ), our 2.875 Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes and our 6.375 Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes allow us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as leverage and could increase or decrease returns to our stockholders. The use of leverage involves significant risks. We are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). 
 Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered borrowings or involve leverage and thus may be subject to Investment Company Act restrictions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered borrowings are not subject to the Investment Company Act s asset coverage requirement. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on the assessment by our Investment Adviser and our board of directors (the "Board of Directors" or the Board of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.

(1) The weighted average yield at amortized cost of our portfolio excludes the Purchase Discount (as defined below) and amortization related to our merger with Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp. GS MMLC (the Merger and does not represent the total return to our stockholders. 

(2) Computed based on (a) the annual actual interest rate or yield earned plus amortization of fees and discounts on the performing debt and other income producing investments as of the reporting date, divided by (b) the total investments (including investments on non-accrual and non-income producing investments) at amortized cost or fair value. 

(3) The calculation includes incremental yield earned on the last-out portion of the unitranche loan investments. 

(4) Computed based on (a) the stated coupon rate, if any, for each income-producing investment, divided by (b) the total investments (including investments on non-accrual and non-income producing investments) at amortized cost or fair value. 

As of September 30, 2024, the total portfolio weighted average yield measured at amortized cost and fair value was 10.9 and 13.3 , as compared to 11.8 and 13.2 as of December 31, 2023. Within Second Lien/Senior Secured Debt, the increase in weighted average yield at cost and fair value was primarily driven by the restoration of MPI Engineering Technologies, LLC to accrual status. Within Unsecured Debt, the decrease in weighted average yield at cost and fair value was primarily driven by the underperformance of Wine.com and the sale of Zodiac Intermediate, LLC (dba Zipari), a first lien debt investment, to mPulse Mobile, Inc. (dba Zipari Inc.), a non-income producing security.

(4) For a particular portfolio company, we calculate the level of contractual indebtedness net of cash net debt owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to measures of cash flow available to service the net debt. To calculate net debt, we include debt that is both senior and pari passu to the tranche of debt owned by us but exclude debt that is legally and contractually subordinated in ranking to the debt owned by us. We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual rights of repayment of the tranche of debt owned by us relative to other senior and junior creditors of a portfolio company. We typically calculate cash flow available for debt service at a portfolio company by taking EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month period. Weighted average net debt to EBITDA is weighted based on the fair value of our debt investments and excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 

For a particular portfolio company, we also calculate the level of contractual interest expense owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to EBITDA interest coverage ratio ). We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual interest obligations of the portfolio company. Weighted average interest coverage is weighted based on the fair value of our performing debt investments, excluding investments where interest coverage may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 
 Median EBITDA is based on our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 
 Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the reported end date. Statistics of the portfolio companies have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk represented 24.9 and 42.9 of total debt investments.

 Our Investment Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company on an ongoing basis to determine if it is meeting its respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each portfolio company. Our Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include: (i) assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; (ii) periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; (iii) comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; (iv) attendance at and participation in Board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and (v) review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser also employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Investment Adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (e.g., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grading system for our investments is as follows: 
 Grade 1 investments involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit; 

Grade 2 investments involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 2; 

Grade 3 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due; and 

Grade 4 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 4, in most cases, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 4, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 

Our Investment Adviser grades the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments graded 3 or 4, our Investment Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. The following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 4 grading scale:

The decrease in investments with a Grade 1 investment performance rating was driven by the exit of investments with an aggregate fair value of 46.81 million, partially offset by investments with an aggregate fair value of 19.81 million being upgraded from a Grade 2 investment performance rating to a Grade 1 investment performance rating due to potential exits.

 Investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to the contractual terms. Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in management s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to this treatment if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

Net increase in net assets from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including acquisitions, the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation in the investment portfolio. 
 On October 12, 2020, we completed our Merger with GS MMLC. The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations Related Issues. The consideration paid to GS MMLC s stockholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the Purchase Discount ). The Purchase Discount was allocated to the cost of GS MMLC investments acquired by us on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the closing date. Immediately following the Merger with GS MMLC, we marked the investments to their respective fair values and, as a result, the Purchase Discount allocated to the cost basis of the investments acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized appreciation on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Purchase Discount allocated to the loan investments acquired will amortize over the life of each respective loan through interest income with a corresponding adjustment recorded as unrealized depreciation on such loans acquired through their ultimate disposition. The Purchase Discount allocated to equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, we will recognize a realized gain with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired. 
 As a supplement to our financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), we have provided, as detailed below, certain non-GAAP financial measures to our operating results that exclude the aforementioned Purchase Discount and the ongoing amortization thereof, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures include (i) Adjusted net investment income after taxes; and (ii) Adjusted net realized and unrealized gains (losses). We believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of the Purchase Discount is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess our financial condition and results of operations. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

PIK income from investments increased from 25.83 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 34.54 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to the increase in the number of investments earning PIK income.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for our investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate purposes, including paying for operating expenses or debt service to the extent we borrow or issue senior securities. 
 72 

Table of Contents 

 We expect to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of any future offerings of securities, future borrowings and cash flows from operations. To the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our Board of Directors otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders, we may enter into credit facilities in addition to our existing credit facilities, as discussed below, or issue other senior securities. We would expect any such credit facilities may be secured by certain of our assets and may contain advance rates based upon pledged collateral. The pricing and other terms of any such facilities would depend upon market conditions when we enter into any such facilities as well as the performance of our business, among other factors. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we are only permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). See Key Components of Operations Leverage. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio based on the aggregate amount outstanding of our senior securities was 183 and 187 . We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions. 
 We may enter into investment commitments through signed commitment letters that may ultimately become investment transactions in the future. We regularly evaluate and carefully consider our unfunded commitments using GSAM s proprietary risk management framework for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity, including our financial leverage. 
 Equity Issuances 
 We may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock through public or at-the-market ("ATM offerings. On May 26, 2022, we entered into (i) an equity distribution agreement by and among us, GSAM and Truist Securities, Inc. Truist and (ii) an equity distribution agreement by and among us, GSAM and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc SMBC ). The equity distribution agreements with Truist and SMBC described in the preceding sentence are collectively referred to herein as the 2022 Equity Distribution Agreements. On and effective August 1, 2023, we terminated the 2022 Equity Distribution Agreements in accordance with their respective terms. 
 On November 15, 2023, we entered into an equity distribution agreement (the 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement by and among us, GSAM and Truist. 
 For further details regarding the 2022 Equity Distribution Agreements and the 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement, see Note 9 Net Assets Equity Issuances At-the-market ATM Offering to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 On March 9, 2023, we completed a follow-on offering (the "March Offering") under our shelf registration statement, issuing 6,500,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the underwriters of 15.09 per share. Net of offering and underwriting costs, we received cash proceeds of 97.58 million. 
 For further details, see Note 9 Net Assets Equity Issuances Follow-on Offering to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 Common Stock Repurchase Plan 
 In November 2021, our Board of Directors approved and authorized a 10b5-1 stock repurchase plan (the 2022 10b5-1 Plan ), which provided for us to repurchase up to 75.00 million of shares of our common stock if our common stock traded below the most recently announced quarter-end NAV per share, subject to certain limitations. The 2022 10b5-1 Plan became effective on August 17, 2022, commenced on September 16, 2022 and expired on August 17, 2023. The 2022 10b5-1 Plan was temporarily suspended in accordance with its terms in connection with the March Offering on March 1, 2023 and remained suspended until its termination on August 17, 2023. 
 For further details, see Note 3 Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
 We have a voluntary dividend reinvestment plan (the DRIP that provides for automatic reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by our Board of Directors unless a stockholder elects to opt out of the plan. As a result, if our Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Due to regulatory considerations, GS Group Inc. has opted out of the DRIP, and GS Co. had also opted out of the DRIP in respect of any shares of our common stock acquired through the 2022 10b5-1 Plan. 
 For further details, see Note 9 Net Assets to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 All correspondence concerning the plan should be directed to the plan agent at Computershare Trust Company, N.A., P.O. Box 43078, Providence, RI 02940-3078, with overnight correspondence being directed to the plan agent at Computershare Trust Company, N.A., 150 Royall St., Suite 101, Canton, MA 02021; by calling 855-807-2742; or through the plan agent s website at www.computershare.com/investor.

 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into certain contracts under which we have future commitments. Payments under the Investment Management Agreement, pursuant to which GSAM has agreed to serve as our Investment Adviser, are equal to (1) a percentage of value of our average gross assets and (2) a two-part Incentive Fee. Under the Administration Agreement, pursuant to which State Street Bank and Trust Company has agreed to furnish us with the administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, we pay our administrator such fees as may be agreed between us and our administrator that we determine are commercially reasonable in our sole discretion. Either party or the stockholders, by a vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, may terminate the Investment Management Agreement without penalty on at least 60 days written notice to the other party. Either party may terminate the Administration Agreement without penalty upon at least 30 days written notice to the other party.

Revolving Credit Facility 
 On September 19, 2013, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility with various lenders. Truist Bank serves as administrative agent and Bank of America, N.A. serves as syndication agent under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The aggregate committed borrowing amount under the Revolving Credit Facility is 1,695.00 million. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility to up to 2,542.50 million. We amended and restated the on numerous occasions between October 3, 2014 and June 28, 2024. 
 Borrowings denominated in USD, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bear interest (at the Company s election) of either (i) Term SOFR plus a margin of either (x) 2.00 , (y) 1.875 (subject to maintenance of certain long-term corporate debt ratings) or (z) 1.75 (subject to certain gross borrowing base conditions), in each case, plus an additional 0.10 credit adjustment spread or (ii) an alternative base rate, which is the highest of (i) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day plus 1/2 of 1.00 and (iii) the rate per annum equal to (x) the greater of (A) Term SOFR for an interest period of one (1) month and (B) zero plus (y) 1.00 , plus a margin of either (x) 1.00 , (y) 0.875 (subject to maintenance of certain long-term corporate debt ratings) or (z) 0.75 (subject to certain gross borrowing base conditions).

With respect to borrowings denominated in USD, we may elect either Term SOFR, or an alternative base rate at the time of borrowing, and such borrowings may be converted from one benchmark to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. Interest is payable in arrears on the applicable interest payment date as specified therein. We pay a fee of 0.375 per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly in arrears. Any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility with respect to certain lenders which hold approximately 87 of total lending commitments, will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable, on October 18, 2028.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to investment commitments and to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to fund investments and to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, we believed that we had adequate financial resources to satisfy our unfunded commitments. Our unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies were as follows:

HEDGING 
 Subject to applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and applicable Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC regulations, we may enter into hedging transactions in a manner consistent with SEC guidance. To the extent that any of our loans are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, we may enter into currency hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We may also enter into interest rate hedging agreements. Such hedging activities, which will be subject to compliance with applicable legal requirements, may include the use of futures, options, swaps and forward contracts. Costs incurred in entering into such contracts or in settling them, if any, will be borne by us. Our Investment Adviser has claimed no-action relief from CFTC registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator pursuant to a CFTC Rule 4.5 with respect to our operations, with the result that we will be limited in our ability to use futures contracts or options on futures contracts or engage in swap transactions. Specifically, CFTC Rule 4.5 imposes strict limitations on using such derivatives other than for hedging purposes, whereby the use of derivatives not used solely for hedging purposes is generally limited to situations where (i) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish such positions does not exceed five percent of the liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such contracts it has entered into; or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of such derivatives does not exceed 100 of the liquidation value of our portfolio. Moreover, we anticipate entering into transactions involving such derivatives to a very limited extent solely for hedging purposes or otherwise within the limitations of CFTC Rule 4.5.

Table of Contents 

 Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act includes limitations on the ability of a BDC (or a RIC) to use derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations (including reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions). Under the rule, BDCs that make significant use of derivatives are subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, a derivatives risk management program, testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These requirements apply unless the BDC qualifies as a limited derivatives user, as defined in Rule 18f-4. Under the rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Under Rule 18f-4, when we trade reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions, including certain tender option bonds, we need to aggregate the amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness (e.g., bank borrowings, if applicable) when calculating our asset coverage ratio. We currently operate as a limited derivatives user and these requirements may limit our ability to use derivatives and/or enter into certain other financial contracts. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Investments, Revenue Recognition, Non-Accrual Investments, Distributions, and Income Taxes. We consider the most significant critical estimate to be the fair value measurement of investments. The critical accounting policies and estimate should be read in connection with our risk factors listed under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Fair Value Measurement of Investments 
 Consistent with GAAP and the Investment Company Act, we conduct a valuation of our investments, pursuant to which our NAV is determined. Our investments are valued on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the Investment Company Act. The determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. The majority of investments are not quoted or traded in an active market and as such their fair values are determined using valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flows, market multiples, and recent comparable transactions. The most significant inputs in applying the discounted cash flow approach and the market multiples approach are the selected discount rates and multiples, respectively. The selection of these inputs is based on a combination of factors that are specific to the underlying portfolio companies such as financial performance and certain factors that are observable in the market such as current interest rates and comparable public company trading multiples. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations and any change in these valuations on the consolidated financial statements. For further details of our investments and fair value measurement accounting policy, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies Investments and Note 5 Fair Value Measurement. 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 On November 7, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of 0.45 per share payable on January 27, 2025 to holders of record as of December 31, 2024.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITA T IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, on a fair value basis, approximately 0.6 and 0.1 of our performing debt investments bore interest at a fixed rate (including income producing preferred stock investments), and approximately 99.4 and 99.9 of our performing debt investments bore interest at a floating rate. Our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate and our 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

We may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, applicable CFTC regulations and in a manner consistent with SEC guidance. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
