 METROCITY BANKSHARES, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 of the Bank. The Company or our, as used herein, includes Metro City Bank unless the context indicates that we refer only to MetroCity Bankshares, Inc. These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP followed within the financial services industry for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information or notes required for complete financial statements. The Company principally operates in business segment, which is community banking. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring items, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements for the interim periods have been included. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. These reclassifications did not have a material effect on previously reported net income, shareholders equity or cash flows. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Company s 2023 Form 10-K ). There were no new accounting policies or changes to existing policies adopted during the first nine months of 2024 which had a significant effect on the Company s results of operations or statement of financial condition. For interim reporting purposes, the Company follows the same basic accounting policies and considers each interim period as an integral part of an annual period.

 million and the creation of an allowance for unfunded commitments of . These one-time cumulative adjustments resulted in a million decrease to retained earnings, net of a million increase to deferred tax assets. For available for sale AFS securities, the new CECL methodology replaced the other-than-temporary impairment model and required the recognition of an allowance for reductions in a security s fair value attributable to declines in credit quality, instead of a direct write-down of the security, when a valuation decline was determined to be other-than-temporary. There was no financial impact related to this implementation since the credit risk associated with our securities portfolio was minimal. The Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis of AFS securities. In January 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures , which eliminated the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings TDRs while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. This guidance was applied on a prospective basis. Upon adoption of this guidance, the Company no longer establishes a specific reserve for modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, unless those loans do not share the same risk characteristics with other loans in the portfolio or are considered collateral dependent. Provided that is not the case, these modifications are included in their respective cohort and the allowance for credit losses is estimated on a pooled basis consistent with the other loans with similar risk characteristics. See Note 3 below for further details. The following new accounting policies were adopted during 2023:

There were securities sold during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Mortgage-backed GSE residential Total Mortgage-backed GSE residential Total At September 30, 2024, the securities available for sale municipal securities and mortgage-backed securities) with an unrealized loss have depreciated from the Company s amortized cost basis. All of these securities have been in a loss position for greater than twelve months. The Company does not believe that the securities available for sale that were in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 represent a credit loss impairment. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no payment defaults nor do we currently expect any future payment defaults. Furthermore, the Company does not intend to sell these securities, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. Equity Securities As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had equity securities with carrying values totaling million and million, respectively. The equity securities consist of our investment in a market-rate bond mutual fund that invests in high quality fixed income bonds, mainly government agency securities whose proceeds are designed to positively impact community development throughout the United States. The mutual fund focuses exclusively on providing affordable housing to low- and moderate-income borrowers and renters, including those in Majority Minority Census Tracts. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized an unrealized gain of and an unrealized loss of 245,000 , respectively, in net income on our equity securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized an unrealized gain of and an unrealized loss of , respectively, in net income on our equity securities.

Many of the leases have or more renewal options which typically are for at the then fair market rental rates. We assessed these renewal options using a threshold of reasonably certain. For leases where we were reasonably certain to renew, those option periods were included within the lease term, and therefore, the measurement of the right-of-use ROU asset and lease liability. ne of our leases include options to terminate the lease and ne have initial terms of 12 months or less (i.e. short-term leases). Operating leases in which the Company is the lessee are recorded as operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company currently does not have any finance leases. Operating lease ROU assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of the remaining lease payments using a discount rate that represents the Company s incremental collateralized borrowing rate provided by the FHLB at the lease commencement date. ROU assets are further adjusted for lease incentives, if any. Operating lease expense, which is comprised of amortization of the ROU asset and the implicit interest accreted on the operating lease liability, is recognized

The interest rate cap was designated as a cash flow hedge of our deposit accounts that are indexed to the Federal Funds Effective rate. The rate cap premium paid by the Company at inception will be amortized on a straight line basis to deposit interest expense over the total term of the interest rate cap agreement. The fair value of the interest rate cap amounted to an unrealized gain of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are recorded in Interest Rate Derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is exposed to credit related losses in the event of the nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swaps. The Company performs an initial credit evaluation and ongoing monitoring procedures for all counterparties and currently anticipates that all counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligation under the contracts. In addition, the Company may require collateral from counterparties in the form of cash deposits in the event that the fair value of the contracts are positive and such fair value for all positions with the counterparty exceeds the credit support thresholds specified by the underlying agreement. Conversely, the Company is required to post cash deposits as collateral in the event the fair value of the contracts are negative and are below the credit support thresholds. At September 30, 2024, there were cash deposits pledged as collateral by the Company. At September 30, 2024, the Company had million of restricted cash obtained from the counterparties as collateral for the significant unrealized gains on our interest rate derivatives.

 Standby letters of credit Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments to extend credit includes million of unused lines of credit and million for standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2024. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Standby letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers. The Company maintains cash deposits with a financial institution that during the year are in excess of the insured limitation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. If the financial institution were not to honor its contractual liability, the Company could incur losses. Management is of the opinion that there is not material risk because of the financial strength of the institution.

 States and political subdivisions Mortgage-backed GSE residential Total securities available for sale Equity securities SBA and USDA servicing asset Interest rate derivatives Nonrecurring fair value measurements: Collateral-dependent loans ) Foreclosed real estate, net ) ) Liabilities Recurring fair value measurements: Interest rate swaps The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Securities, Available for Sale : The Company carries securities available for sale at fair value. For securities where quoted prices are not available (Level 2), the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond s terms and conditions, among other things. The investments in the Company s portfolio are generally not quoted on an exchange but are actively traded in the secondary institutional markets. The Company owns certain SBA investments for which the fair value is determined using Level 3 hierarchy inputs and assumptions as the trading market for such securities was determined to be not active. This determination was based on the limited number of trades or, in certain cases, the existence of no reported trades. Discounted cash flows are calculated by a third party using interest rate curves that are updated to incorporate current market conditions, including prepayment vectors and credit risk. During time when trading is more liquid, broker quotes are used to validate the model. Equity Securities : The Company carries equity securities at fair value. Equity securities are measured at fair value using quoted market prices on nationally recognized and foreign securities exchanges (Level 1). SBA Servicing Assets and Interest Only Strip : The fair values of the Company s servicing assets are determined using Level 3 inputs. All separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities are initially measured at fair value and at each reporting date and changes in fair value are reported in earnings in the period in which they occur. The fair values of the Company s interest-only strips are determined using Level 3 inputs. When the Company sells loans to others, it may hold interest-only strips, which is an interest that continues to be held by the transferor in the securitized receivable. It may also obtain servicing assets or assume servicing liabilities that are initially measured at fair value. Gain or loss on sale of the receivables depends in part on both (a) the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets sold and the interests that continue to be held by the transferor based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer, and (b) the proceeds received. To obtain fair values, quoted market prices are used if available. However, quotes are generally not available for interests that continue to be held by the

The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities, if any, is not included in computing regulatory capital. Management believes as of September 30, 2024 the Company and Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution s category.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition of MetroCity Bancshares, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiary, Metro City Bank, from December 31, 2023 through September 30, 2024 and on our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and information presented elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 1. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as may, might, should, could, predict, potential, believe, expect, continue, will, anticipate, seek, estimate, intend, plan, strive, projection, goal, target, outlook, aim, would, annualized and outlook, or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

CECL Adoption On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 which replaces the incurred loss approach for measuring credit losses with an expected loss model, referred to the current expected credit loss ("CECL") model. CECL applies to financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures, which include, but are not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments and financial guarantees. The adoption of this guidance resulted in an increase of the allowance for credit losses of 5.1 million, the creation of an 

 39 

Table of Contents 
 allowance for unfunded commitments of 239,000 and a reduction of retained earnings of 3.8 million, net of the increase in deferred tax assets of 1.5 million. The impact of utilizing the CECL approach to calculate the allowance for credit losses will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the provision for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility to our reported earnings. See Note 1 and Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, for additional information on the allowance for credit losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting and reporting estimates conform with U.S. GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We consider accounting estimates that can (1) be replaced by other reasonable estimates and/or (2) changes to an estimate from period to period that have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations as well as (3) those estimates that require significant and complex assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain to be critical accounting estimates. We consider our critical accounting policies to include the allowance for credit losses, servicing assets, fair value of financial instruments and income taxes. Critical accounting estimates include a high degree of uncertainty in the underlying assumptions. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed relevant. The development, selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Actual results could differ from these estimates. For additional information regarding critical accounting policies, refer to Part II - Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. T here have been no significant changes in the Company s application of critical accounting policies since December 31, 2023. Reserve for Credit Losses A consequence of lending activities is that we may incur credit losses. The amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance of borrowers. The reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for credit losses ACL and the allowance for unfunded commitments. As a result of our January 1, 2023 adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, and its related amendments, our methodology for estimating the reserve for credit losses changed significantly from December 31, 2022. The standard replaced the incurred loss approach with an expected loss approach known as the Current Expected Credit Losses CECL ). The CECL approach requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). It removes the incurred loss approach s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was probable a loss event was incurred. The estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL approach is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. We then consider whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for loan-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience was used. Finally, we consider forecasts about future economic conditions that are reasonable and supportable. The allowance for unfunded commitments represents the expected credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded commitments to extend credit. This allowance is estimated by loan segment at each balance sheet date under the CECL model using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur.

Table of Contents 
 Management s evaluation of the appropriateness of the reserve for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution. Our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the credit risk rating we assign to individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, reliance on historical loss rates on homogenous portfolios, consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of economic factors, and the reliance on our reasonable and supportable forecasts. The reserve for credit losses attributable to each portfolio segment also includes an amount for inherent risks not reflected in the historical analyses. Relevant factors include, but are not limited to, concentrations of credit risk (geographic, large borrower, and industry), changes in underwriting standards, changes in collateral values, experience and depth of lending staff, trends in delinquencies, and the volume and terms of loans. See Note 1 and Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, for additional information on the reserve and allowance for credit losses.

 Results of Operations We recorded net income of 16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 11.4 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 5.3 million, or 46.1 . This increase was due to an increase in net interest income of 6.1 million and an increase in noninterest income of 4.0 million, offset by an increase in noninterest expense of 2.1 million, an increase in income tax expense of 1.7 million and an increase in provision for credit losses of 963,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net income of 48.3 million compared to 40.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 8.0 million, or 19.9 . This increase was due to an increase in net interest income of 12.7 million and an increase in noninterest income of 4.3 million, offset by an increase in noninterest expense of 5.2 million, an increase income tax expense of 2.6 million and an increase in provision for credit losses of 1.1 million. Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.66 and 0.65, respectively, compared to 0.45 for both the basic and diluted earnings per common share for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, basic and diluted earnings per common share was 1.91 and 1.89, respectively, compared to 1.60 and 1.58 for the same period in 2023, respectively. Interest Income Interest income totaled 53.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.1 million, or 10.5 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 45 basis points increase in the loan yield coupled with an 86.2 million increase in average loan balances, as well as a 38 basis points increase in the total investment yield coupled with a 19.7 million increase in the average total investment balance. The increase in average loans is due to an increase of 93.5 million in average commercial real estate loans, an increase of 6.1 million in average residential mortgage loans and an increase of 2.8 million in average commercial and industrial loans, offset by a decrease of 16.4 million in construction and development loans. As compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, the yield on average interest-earning assets increased by 44 basis points to 6.36 from 5.92 with the yield on average loans increasing by 45 basis points and the yield on average total investments increasing by 38 basis points. Interest income was 160.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 142.2 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 18.1 million, or 12.8 , primarily due to a 48 basis point increase in the loan yield coupled with an increase in average loan balances of 112.5 million, as well as a 58 basis points increase in the interest earning cash accounts yield coupled with a 20.0 million increase in the average interest earning cash balances. The increase in average loans is due to an increase of 73.9 million in average commercial real estate loans, a 44.5 million increase in average residential mortgage loans and an increase of 13.8 million in average commercial and industrial loans, offset by a decrease of 19.8 million in construction and development loans. As compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the yield on average interest-earning assets increased by 48 basis points to 6.36 from 5.88 with the yield on average loans increasing by 48 basis points and the yield on average total investments increasing by 58 basis points. Interest Expense Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.0 million, or 4.1 , to 23.5 million compared to interest expense of 24.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 44 basis points decrease in deposit costs, offset by a 31.8 million increase in average deposit balances. The 44 basis points decrease in deposit costs was primarily driven by a 199 basis points decrease in the yield on average money market deposits from the benefit received on our interest rate swaps, offset by an 81 basis point increase in time deposit costs. Average time deposits increased by 91.5 million while average money market deposits decreased by 54.4 million. Average borrowings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 50.7 million with an increase in rate of 73 basis points compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense totaled 72.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.4 million, or 8.1 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 128.4 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits

 and a 108 basis points increase in borrowing costs, partially offset by a seven basis points decrease in deposit costs. Average borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 3.1 million compared to the same period in 2023. The Company currently has interest rate derivative agreements totaling 850.0 million that are designated as cash flow hedges of our deposit accounts indexed to the Federal Funds Effective rate. The weighted average pay rate for these interest rate derivatives is 2.29 . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a credit to interest expense of 6.4 million from the benefit received on these interest rate derivatives compared to a credit to interest expense of 1.3 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a credit to interest expense of 17.0 million from the benefit received on these interest rate derivatives compared to a credit to interest expense of 2.3 million recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Based on the Federal Funds Effective rate as of September 30, 2024 (4.83 ), the Company would estimate to record a credit to interest expense of approximately 5.4 million for the remainder of 2024 from the benefit received on these interest rate derivatives. See Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, for additional information on these interest rate derivatives. Net Interest Margin The net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 64 basis points to 3.58 from 2.94 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 44 basis points increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets of 3.37 billion and a 28 basis points decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities of 2.54 billion. Average earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 105.9 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 86.2 million increase in average loans and a 19.7 million increase in average total investments. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 82.4 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by increases in average borrowings of 50.7 million and average interest-bearing deposits of 31.8 million. The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 39 basis points to 3.50 from 3.11 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 48 basis points increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets of 3.37 billion, offset by a 10 basis points increase in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities of 2.56 billion. Average earning assets increased by 131.4 million due to a 112.5 million increase in average loans and a 20.0 million increase in average interest-earning cash accounts. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by 125.3 million, primarily driven by an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of 128.4 million, offset by a 3.1 million decrease in average borrowings. Net interest margin and net interest income are influenced by internal and external factors. Internal factors include balance sheet changes on both volume and mix and pricing decisions, and external factors include changes in market interest rates, competition and the shape of the interest rate yield curve. The increase in our net interest margin is primarily the result of our decreasing deposit costs from the benefit received on our interest rate derivatives, as well as the continued increase to our loan yields.

 Rate/Volume Analysis Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income during the period shown. Information is provided with respect to (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior rate) and (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). Change applicable to both volumes and rate have been allocated to volume.

Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses reflects our internal calculation and judgment of the appropriate amount of the allowance for credit losses. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments or CECL has significantly changed the methodology of how we measure credit losses (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). We maintain the allowance for credit losses at levels we believe are appropriate to cover our estimate of expected credit losses over the life of loans in the portfolio as of the end of the reporting period. The allowance for credit losses is determined through detailed quarterly analyses of our loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is based on our loss experience, changes in the economic environment, reasonable and supportable forecasts, as well as an ongoing assessment of credit quality and environmental factors not reflective in historical loss rates. Additional qualitative factors that are considered in determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses are c oncentrations of credit risk (geographic, large borrower, and industry), changes in underwriting standards, changes in collateral value, experience and depth of lending staff, trends in delinquencies, and the volume and terms of loans. We recorded a provision for credit losses of 582,000 and 314,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a credit to the provision for credit losses of 381,000 and 797,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision expense recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the increase in reserves allocated to our individually analyzed loans, as well as the increase in general reserves allocated to our commercial real estate loan portfolio due to higher loan balances, partially offset by the decrease in the general reserves allocated to our residential mortgage loan portfolio as a large amount of residential mortgage loans were sold during the period. Our ACL as a percentage of gross loans for the periods ended September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 was 0.60 , 0.57 and 0.58 , respectively. Our ACL as a percentage of gross loans is relatively lower than our peers due to our high percentage of residential mortgage loans, which tend to have lower allowance for credit loss ratios compared to other commercial or consumer loans due to their low LTVs. See the section captioned Allowance for Credit Losses elsewhere in this document for further analysis of our provision for credit losses.

The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Noninterest income: Service charges on deposit accounts 531 490 41 8.4 1,510 1,403 107 7.6 Other service charges, commissions and fees 1,915 1,478 437 29.6 5,100 3,618 1,482 41.0 Gain on sale of residential mortgage loans 526 526 100.0 1,925 1,925 100.0 Mortgage servicing income, net 422 (85) 507 596.5 1,758 (232) 1,990 857.8 Gain on sale of SBA loans 1,083 244 839 343.9 2,134 3,267 (1,133) (34.7) SBA servicing income, net 1,231 270 961 355.9 3,287 3,472 (185) (5.3) Other income 907 260 647 248.8 2,028 1,964 64 3.3 Total noninterest income 6,615 2,657 3,958 149.0 17,742 13,492 4,250 31.5 Service charges on deposit accounts increased 41,000, or 8.4 , to 531,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 490,000 for the same three months during 2023. Service charges on deposit accounts were 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.4 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 107,000, or 7.6 . These increases were primarily attributable to higher overdraft fees and wire transfer fees, offset by lower analysis charges. Other service charges, commissions and fees increased 437,000, or 29.6 , to 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other service charges, commissions and fees increased 1.5 million, or 41.0 , to 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were mainly attributable to higher origination, underwriting and processing fees earned from our origination of residential mortgage loans as mortgage volume increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. Mortgage loan originations totaled 122.4 million and 310.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 91.9 million and 208.1 million during the same periods in 2023. Total gain on sale of loans was 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 244,000 for the same period of 2023, an increase of 1.4 million, or 559.4 . Total gain on sale of loans was 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.3 million for the same period of 2023, an increase of 792,000, or 24.2 . Gain on sale of residential mortgage loans totaled 526,000 and 1.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we sold 54.2 million and 187.5 million in residential mortgage loans during these periods with an average premium of 1.05 . We recorded no gain on sale of residential mortgage loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as no mortgage loans were sold during the period. Gain on sale of SBA loans totaled 1.1 million and 2.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 244,000 and 3.3 million for the same periods in 2023. We sold 28.9 million and 52.9 million in SBA loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 with average premiums of 6.67 and 6.69 ,

 respectively. We sold 5.2 million and 71.9 million in SBA loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 with average premiums of 6.00 and 6.09 , respectively. Mortgage loan servicing income, net of amortization, increased by 507,000, or 596.5 , to 422,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an expense balance of 85,000 for the same period of 2023. Mortgage loan servicing income increased by 2.0 million, or 857.8 , to 1.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an expense balance of 232,000 for the same period of 2023. The changes in mortgage loan servicing income were primarily due to decreases in mortgage servicing amortization and an increase in capitalized mortgage servicing assets, partially offset by the decrease in mortgage servicing fees. Included in mortgage loan servicing income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 580,000 and 1.7 million in mortgage servicing fees compared to 606,000 and 1.9 million for the same periods in 2023 and capitalized mortgage servicing assets of 310,000 and 1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the same periods in 2023. These amounts were offset by mortgage loan servicing asset amortization of 216,000 and 957,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 691,000 and 2.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a fair value impairment of 252,000 on our mortgage servicing assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not record a fair value impairment on our mortgage servicing assets. Our total residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio was 556.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 464.8 million at September 30, 2023. SBA servicing income increased by 961,000, or 355.9 , to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 270,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. SBA servicing income was 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.5 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 185,000, or 5.3 . Our total SBA and USDA loan servicing portfolio was 487.4 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 487.8 million as of September 30 2023. Included in SBA servicing income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.0 million and 3.2 million in SBA servicing fees compared to 1.2 million and 3.4 million for the same periods in 2023. Our SBA servicing rights are carried at fair value and the inputs used to calculate fair value change from period to period. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 201,000 fair value increase to our SBA servicing rights compared to a 911,000 fair value charge to our SBA servicing rights during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 69,000 fair value increase to our SBA servicing rights compared to a 58,000 fair value increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other noninterest income increased by 647,000, or 248.8 , to 907,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 260,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other noninterest income was 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 64,000, or 3.3 . The increases were mainly due to increases in bank owned life insurance income and unrealized gains on our equity securities. These increases were partially offset by decreases in gain on sale of foreclosed real estate as a 547,000 gain on sale was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to a 85,000 loss on sale being recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The largest component of other noninterest income is the income on bank owned life insurance which totaled 609,000 and 1.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 452,000 and 1.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Included in other noninterest income are fair value gains/losses on our equity securities, which totaled 292,000 (gain) and 233,000 (gain) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 245,000 (loss) and 187,000 (loss) for the same periods in 2023, respectively. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.7 million compared to 11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.1 million, or 18.4 . Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 39.1 million compared to 33.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 5.2 million, or 15.5 .

 The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Noninterest Expense: Salaries and employee benefits 8,512 6,864 1,648 24.0 23,930 20,333 3,597 17.7 Occupancy and equipment 1,430 1,272 158 12.4 4,118 3,525 593 16.8 Data processing 311 300 11 3.7 958 928 30 3.2 Advertising 145 143 2 1.4 474 454 20 4.4 Other expenses 3,262 2,961 301 10.2 9,573 8,571 1,002 11.7 Total noninterest expense 13,660 11,540 2,120 18.4 39,053 33,811 5,242 15.5 Salaries and employee benefits expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.5 million compared to 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.6 million, or 24.0 . Salaries and employee benefits expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.9 million compared to 20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.6 million, or 17.7 . These increases were partially attributable to higher employee salaries, restricted stock expense and employee insurance, as well as higher commissions paid to our loan officers as loan volume increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. Occupancy and equipment expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.4 million compared to 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 158,000, or 12.4 . Occupancy and equipment expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.1 million compared to 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 593,000, or 16.8 . These increases were primarily due to higher maintenance and service expense, rent expense, and depreciation expense. Data processing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained relatively flat compared to the same periods in 2023. Advertising expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained relatively flat compared to the same periods in 2023. Other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.3 million compared to 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 301,000, or 10.2 . This increase was partially due to higher security expense and other real estate owned related expenses, offset by lower FDIC insurance premiums and professional fees. Other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 9.6 million compared to 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.0 million, or 11.7 . This increase was partially due to higher FDIC insurance premiums, audit expense, security expense and other real estate owned expenses, partially offset by lower loan related expenses and legal fees. Included in other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were directors fees of approximately 477,000 and 452,000, respectively. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 6.0 million and 4.2 million, respectively. The Company s effective tax rates were 26.3 and 27.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 18.2 million and 15.6 million, respectively.

 Financial Condition Total assets increased 66.4 million, or 1.9 , to 3.57 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.50 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to increases in cash and due from banks of 136.6 million, federal funds sold of 9.8 million and Federal Home Loan Bank stock of 2.4 million, partially offset by decreases in loans held for investment of 54.3 million, loans held for sale of 17.7 million and interest rate derivatives of 12.9 million.

 Asset Quality Nonperforming Loans Asset quality remained strong during the third quarter of 2024 as our nonperforming loans to total loans remained low at 0.46 as of September 30, 2024. Nonperforming loans were 14.3 million at September 30 2024 compared to 14.7 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was attributable to a 366,000 decrease in nonaccrual loans. We did not recognize any interest income on nonaccrual loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023. The following table sets forth the allocation of our nonperforming assets among our different asset categories as of the dates indicated. Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans plus OREO. Nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2024 comprised of 537,000 of commercial real estate loans, 189,000 of commercial and industrial loans and 13.6 million of residential real estate loans. Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2023 comprised of 548,000 of construction and development loans, 991,000 of commercial real estate loans, 1.3 million of commercial and industrial loans, and 11.9 million of residential real estate loans. 

(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Nonaccrual loans 14,316 14,682 Past due loans 90 days or more and still accruing Total nonperforming loans 14,316 14,682 Foreclosed real estate 1,515 1,466 Total nonperforming assets 15,831 16,148 Nonperforming loans to gross loans 0.46 0.47 Nonperforming assets to total assets 0.44 0.46 Allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 129.85 123.36 Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses was 18.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 18.1 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 477,000, or 2.6 . The increase was primarily due to the increase in reserves allocated to our individually analyzed loans, as well as the increase in general reserves allocated to our commercial real estate loan portfolio due to higher loan balances, partially offset by the decrease in the general reserves allocated to our residential mortgage loan portfolio as a large amount of residential mortgage loans were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We maintain a reserve for credit losses that consists of two components, the allowance for credit losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments. The allowance for credit losses provides for the risk of credit losses expected in our loan portfolio and is based on loss estimates derived from a comprehensive quarterly evaluation. The evaluation reflects analyses of individual borrowers for impairment coupled with analysis of historical loss experience in various loan pools that have been grouped based on similar risk characteristics, supplemented as necessary by credit judgment that considers observable trends, conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other relevant environmental and economic factors. The level of the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by recording an expense or credit through the provision for credit losses. The level of the allowance for unfunded commitments is adjusted by recording an expense or credit in other noninterest expense. The allowance for unfunded commitments was created upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2023 and had a balance of 216,000 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 294,000 as of September 30, 2023. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. For collateral dependent loans where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loan to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value

 of expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized costs basis of the loan exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated cost to sell. The ACL may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the loan. The impact of utilizing the CECL approach to calculate the allowance for credit losses will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the provision for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility to our reported earnings. See Note 1 and Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, for additional information on the on the allowance for credit losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments. It is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The FDIC and GA DBF also review the allowance for credit losses as an integral part of their examination process. Based on information currently available, management believes that our allowance for credit losses is adequate. However, the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if economic conditions and the real estate market in our market areas were expected to weaken. The effect of such events, although uncertain at this time, could result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and increased credit losses, which could adversely affect our future growth and profitability. No assurance of the ultimate level of credit losses can be given with any certainty. Analysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses. The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for credit losses, provision for credit losses and net charge-offs for the periods presented below:

 Deposits Total deposits decreased 7.8 million, or 0.3 , to 2.72 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 2.73 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to a 63.1 million decrease in money market accounts (includes a 23.1 million decrease in brokered money markets), a 41.4 million decrease in interest-bearing demand deposits and a 2.2 million decrease in savings accounts, offset by a 58.5 million increase in time deposits and a 40.4 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 20.3 and 18.7 of total deposits, respectively, were comprised of noninterest-bearing demand accounts and 79.7 and 81.3 , respectively, of interest-bearing deposit accounts. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had estimated uninsured deposits of 648.8 million and 730.5 million, respectively. These estimates were derived using the same methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting. Uninsured deposits were 23.6 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to 26.5 and 27.3 at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.28 billion of available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank 701.6 million), Federal Reserve Discount Window 532.2 million) and various other financial institutions (fed fund lines totaling 47.5 million). We had 751.0 million of brokered deposits, or 27.6 of total deposits, at September 30, 2024 compared to 766.3 million, or 28.1 of total deposits, at December 31, 2023. We use brokered deposits, subject to certain limitations and requirements, as a source of funding to support our asset growth and augment the deposits generated from our branch network, which are our principal source of funding. Our level of brokered deposits varies from time to time depending on competitive interest rate conditions and other factors and tends to increase as a percentage of total deposits when the brokered deposits are less costly than issuing internet certificates of deposit or borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank. We use interest rate swap and cap agreements to hedge our deposit accounts that are indexed to the federal funds effective rate. These swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges. As of September 30, 2024, the total amount of deposits tied to the Federal Funds Effective Rate was 903.8 million.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a credit to interest expense of 6.4 million from the benefit received on these interest rate derivatives compared to a credit to interest expense of 1.3 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a credit to interest expense of 17.0 million from the benefit received on these interest rate derivatives compared to a credit to interest expense of 2.3 million recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These benefits resulted in a 95 basis points and 83 basis points reduction to the total deposits weighted average rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to a 19 basis points and 12 basis points reduction for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Borrowed Funds Other than deposits, we also utilized FHLB advances as a supplementary funding source to finance our operations. The advances from the FHLB are collateralized by residential real estate loans. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had available borrowing capacity from the FHLB of 701.6 million and 721.1 million, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 375.0 million and 325.0 million, respectively, of outstanding advances from the FHLB. In addition to our advances with the FHLB, we maintain federal funds agreements with our correspondent banks. Our available borrowings under these agreements were 47.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We did not have any advances outstanding under these agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We also have access to the Federal Reserve s discount window in the amount of 532.2 million and 446.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. No discount window borrowings were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We also maintain relationships in the capital markets with brokers to issue certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Liquidity refers to the measure of our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and access to alternative sources of funds. Our liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in correspondent banks, federal funds sold, and fair value of unpledged investment securities. Other available sources of liquidity include wholesale/brokered deposits, and additional borrowings from correspondent banks, FHLB advances, and the Federal Reserve discount window.

 Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan and investment portfolios, and increases in customer deposits. Other alternative sources of funds will supplement these primary sources to the extent necessary to meet additional liquidity requirements on either a short-term or long-term basis. As part of our liquidity management strategy, we open federal funds lines with our correspondent banks. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 47.5 million of unsecured federal funds lines with no amounts advanced. In addition, the Company had Federal Reserve Discount Window funds available of approximately 532.2 million and 446.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The FRB discount window line is collateralized by a pool of construction and development, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans with carrying balances totaling 631.1 million as of September 30, 2024, as well as all of the Company s municipal and mortgage backed securities. There were no outstanding borrowings on this line as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 375.0 million and 325.0 million, respectively, of outstanding advances from the FHLB. Based on the values of loans pledged as collateral, we had 701.6 million and 721.1 million of additional borrowing availability with the FHLB as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We also maintain relationships in the capital markets with brokers to issue certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Capital Requirements The Company and the Bank are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy. The table below summarizes the capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank in order to be considered well-capitalized from a regulatory perspective, as well as the Company s and the Bank s capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered to be well-capitalized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the FDIC categorized the Bank as well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework. There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2023 that management believes would change this classification. While the Company believes that it has sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession, its reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted in future periods.

Any future determination to pay dividends to holders of our common stock will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, banking regulations, contractual restrictions and any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheet. The contractual or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if we deem collateral is necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. They are intended to be disbursed, subject to certain condition, upon request of the borrower. See Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, for more information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, equity prices, and credit spreads. We have identified interest rate risk as our primary source of market risk. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (repricing risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers ability to prepay home mortgage loans at any time and depositors ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and Federal funds effective (basis risk). Our board of directors establishes broad policy limits with respect to interest rate risk. As part of this policy, the asset liability committee, or ALCO, establishes specific operating guidelines within the parameters of the board of directors policies. In general, the ALCO focuses on ensuring a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income through managing the size and mix of the balance sheet. The management of interest rate risk is an active process which encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and policy constraints. An asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate higher net interest income, as rates earned on our interest-earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, thus expanding our net interest margin. Conversely, a liability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate lower net interest income, as rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned on our interest-earning assets, thus compressing our net interest margin. Interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the ALCO at least quarterly. The information reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk. Evaluation of Interest Rate Risk We use income simulations, an analysis of core funding utilization, and economic value of equity (EVE) simulations as our primary tools in measuring and managing interest rate risk. These tools are utilized to quantify the potential earnings impact of changing interest rates over a two year simulation horizon (income simulations) as well as identify expected earnings trends given longer term rate cycles (long term simulations, core funding utilizations, and EVE simulation). A standard gap report and funding matrix will also be utilized to provide supporting detailed information on the expected timing of cashflow and repricing opportunities. There are an infinite number of potential interest rate scenarios, each of which can be accompanied by differing economic/political/regulatory climates; can generate multiple differing behavior patterns by markets, borrowers, depositors, etc.; and can last for varying degrees of time. Therefore, by definition, interest rate risk sensitivity cannot be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, the Bank s interest rate risk measurement philosophy focuses on maintaining an appropriate balance between theoretical and practical scenarios; especially given the primary objective of the Bank s overall asset/liability management process is to facilitate meaningful strategy development and implementation.

 Therefore, we model a set of interest rate scenarios capturing the financial effects of a range of plausible rate scenarios, the collective impact of which will enable the Bank to clearly understand the nature and extent of its sensitivity to interest rate changes. Doing so necessitates an assessment of rate changes over varying time horizons and of varying/sufficient degrees such that the impact of embedded options within the balance sheet are sufficiently examined. We use a net interest income simulation model to measure and evaluate potential changes in our net interest income. We run three standard and plausible simulations comparing current or flat rates with a +/- 200 basis point ramp in rates over 12 and 24 months. These rate scenarios are considered appropriate as we believe they represent a more realistic range of rate movements that could occur in the near to medium term. This analysis also provides the foundation for historical tracking of interest rate risk. The impact of interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and caps, is included in the model. Potential changes to our net interest income in hypothetical rising and declining rate scenarios calculated as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented in the following table: 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity 12 Month Projection 24 Month Projection (Ramp in basis points) +200 -200 +200 -200 September 30, 2024 1.70 (4.10) (4.00) (6.20) December 31, 2023 (0.90) 0.00 1.50 7.80 We also model the impact of rate changes on our Economic Value of Equity, or EVE. We base the modeling of EVE based on interest rate shocks as shocks are considered more appropriate for EVE, which accelerates future interest rate risk into current capital via a present value calculation of all future cashflows from the bank s existing inventory of assets and liabilities. Our simulation model incorporates interest rate shocks of +/- 100, 200, and 300 basis points. The results of the model are presented in the table below: 

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity (Shock in basis points) +300 +200 +100 -100 -200 -300 September 30, 2024 (11.80) (7.30) (2.90) 2.30 2.50 (0.70) December 31, 2023 (22.20) (15.00) (7.50) 9.40 18.60 26.10 Our simulation model incorporates various assumptions, which we believe are reasonable but which may have a significant impact on results such as: (i) the timing of changes in interest rates; (ii) shifts or rotations in the yield curve; (iii) re-pricing characteristics for market-rate-sensitive instruments; (iv) varying loan prepayment speeds for different interest rate scenarios; and (v) the overall growth and mix of assets and liabilities. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results but rather as a means to better plan and execute appropriate asset-liability management strategies and manage our interest rate risk. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The Company is continually monitoring and assessing changes in processes and activities to determine any potential impact on the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are a party to various legal proceedings such as claims and lawsuits arising in the course of our normal business activities. Although the ultimate outcome of all claims and lawsuits outstanding as of September 30, 2024 cannot be ascertained at this time, it is the opinion of management that these matters, when resolved, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I Item 1A Risk Factors of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, which could materially affect its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or future results. Please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or the trading price of our securities. There are no material changes during the period covered by this Report to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On September 5, 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors of the Company approved the adoption of a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock. The share repurchase program began on September 6, 2023 and ended on September 30, 2024. The repurchases are made in compliance with all Securities and Exchange Commission rules, including Rule 10b-18, and other legal requirements and may be made in part under Rule 10b5-1 plans, which permits stock repurchases when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so. Repurchases can be made from time-to-time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market and/or other conditions. The repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The following table summarizes the repurchases of our common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2024.
