expects to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. 

Reverse Stock Split 

On
October 27, 2023, pursuant to the authorization provided by the Company s stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders, the
Company filed an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate a reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding
Common Stock by a ratio of one-for-fifteen (the First Reverse Split ). The First Reverse Split did not affect the number
of authorized shares of Common Stock, preferred stock or their respective par value per share. As a result of the First Reverse Split,
each fifteen shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the First Reverse Split were converted into one share of Common Stock.
The First Reverse Split became effective in the State of Delaware on October 31, 2023. All share amounts in these financial statements
have been updated for all periods presented to reflect the First Reverse Split. 

On
July 10, 2024, pursuant to the authorization provided by the Company s stockholders at its annual meeting of stockholders, the Company
filed an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate a reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding
Common Stock by a ratio of one-for-ten (the Second Reverse Split ). The Second Reverse Split did not affect the number of
authorized shares of Common Stock, preferred stock or their respective par value per share. As a result of the Second Reverse Split, each
ten shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Second Reverse Split were converted into one share of Common Stock. The
Second Reverse Split became effective in the State of Delaware on July 16, 2024. All share amounts in these financial statements have
been updated for all periods presented to reflect the Second Reverse Split. 

 million, working capital of million, an accumulated deficit of million and stockholders equity of 
million. For the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, the Company had net losses of million and million, respectively.
For the six months ended October 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was million. Historically, the Company has financed
its operations principally through issuances of equity and debt instruments. 

Management
believes its current cash on hand is not sufficient to fund its planned operations through one year after the date the condensed financial
statements are issued. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at
least one year after the date that these condensed financial statements are issued. 

The Company s inability to
continue as a going concern could have a negative impact on the Company, including its ability to obtain
needed financing. The Company s condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should it be unable to
continue as a going concern. 

The Company expects to continue
to incur losses for the foreseeable future and needs to raise additional capital until it is able to generate revenues from operations
sufficient to fund its development and commercial operations. These factors create substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern . However, based on the Company s current business plan, management believes
that the Company s cash and cash equivalents at October 31, 2024, together with the anticipated receipt of funds from its at-the-market 
offering and from the sale of its Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the securities purchase agreements related
thereto, will be sufficient to meet the Company s anticipated cash requirements during the twelve-month period subsequent to the
issuance of the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report.

Level 3 assumptions: Unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities including
liabilities resulting from imbedded derivatives associated with certain warrants to purchase Common Stock. 

The fair values of warrants
are determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, a Level 3 fair value measurement, based on the estimated fair value
of Common Stock, volatility based on the historical volatility data of similar companies, considering the industry, products and market
capitalization of such other entities, the expected life based on the remaining contractual term of the warrants and the risk free interest
rate based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury Securities with a maturity equivalent to the warrants contractual life. 

five years. Significant additions and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are charged to
expense as incurred. 

Since the effects of outstanding
stock options, restricted stock units and warrants are anti-dilutive in the periods presented, shares of Common Stock underlying these
instruments have been excluded from the computation of loss per common share. 

The following sets forth the
number of shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and warrants that have been excluded from
the computation of loss per common share:

 shares of Common Stock to be offered to the Company s directors, officers, employees, and consultants. On March
1, 2019, the Company s stockholders approved an additional shares to be available for issuance under the Plan. Options granted
under the Plan have an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying Common Stock at the date of grant and
become exercisable based on a vesting schedule determined at the date of grant. The options expire between five and years from the
date of grant. Restricted stock awards granted under the Plan are subject to a vesting period determined at the date of grant. 

2021 Stock Incentive
Plan 

In February 2021, the Company s
board of directors (the Board adopted, and the stockholders approved, the Alzamend Neuro, Inc. 2021 Stock Incentive Plan
(the 2021 Plan ). The 2021 Plan authorizes the grant to eligible individuals of (1) stock options (incentive and non-statutory),
(2) restricted stock, (3) stock appreciation rights, or SARs, (4) restricted stock units, and (5) other stock-based compensation. 

Stock Subject to the 2021
Plan. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the 2021 Plan is 66,667 shares, which number will
be increased to the extent that compensation granted under the 2021 Plan is forfeited, expires or is settled for cash (except as otherwise
provided in the 2021 Plan). Substitute awards (awards made or shares issued by the Company in assumption of, or in substitution or exchange
for, awards previously granted, or the right or obligation to make future awards, in each case by a company that the Company acquires
or any subsidiary of the Company or with which the Company or any subsidiary combines) will not reduce the shares authorized for grant
under the 2021 Plan, nor will shares subject to a substitute award be added to the shares available for issuance or transfer under the
2021 Plan. 

Restricted Stock. In
May 2021, the Company issued restricted stock awards pursuant to the 2021 Plan to one employee. The restricted stock award vests over
48 months. The award requires continued service to the Company during the vesting period. The vesting provisions of individual awards
may vary as approved by the Board. Compensation expense for restricted stock is generally recorded based on its market value on the date
of grant and recognized ratably over the associated service and performance period. 

Stock Options. All
options that the Company grants are granted at the per share fair value on the grant date. Vesting of options differs based on the terms
of each option. The Company has valued the options at their date of grant utilizing the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of the
date of issuance of these options, there was not an active public market for the Company s shares. Accordingly, the fair value of
the underlying options was determined based on the historical volatility data of similar companies, considering the industry, products
and market capitalization of such other entities. The risk-free interest rate used in the calculations is based on the implied yield available
on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent term approximating the expected life of the options as calculated using the simplified method.
The expected life of the options used was based on the contractual life calculated using the simplified method. Stock-based compensation
is a non-cash expense because the Company settles these obligations by issuing shares of Common Stock from its authorized shares instead
of settling such obligations with cash payments.

Performance Contingent
Stock Options Granted to Employee 

On November 26, 2019, the
Board granted performance and market contingent awards to certain key employees and a director. These grants were made outside
of the Plan. These awards have an exercise price of 225.00 per share. These awards have multiple separate market triggers for vesting
based upon either (i) the successful achievement of stepped target closing prices on a national securities exchange for 90 consecutive
trading days later than 180 days after the Company s initial public offering IPO for its common stock, or (ii) stepped
target prices for a change in control transaction. The target prices ranged from 1,500 per share to 6,000 per share. , the unvested portion of the performance options will be reduced by
25 . 

On November 22, 2022, the
Compensation Committee of the Board modified the performance criteria for these awards. The target price range is now 1,500 per share
to 3,000 per share. Additionally, if the stock price milestones are now not achieved by November 27, 2026, as opposed to within three
years, the unvested portion of the portion of the performance options will be reduced by 25 . Due to the significant risks and uncertainties
associated with achieving the market-contingent awards, as of October 31, 2024, management believes that the achievement of the requisite
performance conditions is not probable and, as a result, no compensation cost has been recognized for these awards. 

On November 29, 2022, the
Compensation Committee of the Board granted 13,333 performance-based stock option to the Chief Executive Officer at an exercise price
of 175.50 per share, of which 50 vest upon the completion and announcement of topline data from the Company s Phase II clinical
trial of AL001 within three years from grant date and the remaining 50 vest upon the completion and announcement of topline data from
the Company s Phase II clinical trial of ALZN002 within four years from the grant date. During the three months ended July 31, 2023,
management believed that it was probable that the performance condition of the completion and announcement of topline data from the Company s
Phase II clinical trial of AL001 would be achieved and had recognized the related stock-based compensation. As of October 31, 2024, management
believed that the achievement of the second performance condition was not probable and, as a result, no compensation cost has been recognized
related to Phase I/IIA of ALZN002. 

Performance Contingent
Stock Options Granted to TAMM Net 

On March 23, 2021, the Company
issued performance-based stock options to certain team members at TAMM Net, Inc. TAMM Net to purchase an aggregate of
3,000 shares of Common Stock at a per share exercise price of 225.00 per share, of which 50 would vest upon the completion of Phase
I of AL001 by March 31, 2022, and the remaining 50 would vest upon completion of Phase I/IIA of ALZN002 by December 31, 2022. 

On January 19, 2023, the Board
modified the performance criteria for these awards. The remaining 50 of the grant will now vest upon the completion and announcement
of topline data of the first cohort from a Phase I/IIA clinical trial of ALZN002 on/or before March 31, 2024. The modified performance
criteria was not met on or before March 31, 2024 and, as a result, the remaining unvested stock options were cancelled and no compensation
cost has been recognized for these awards related to ALZN002. 

Performance Contingent
Stock Options Granted to Consultants 

On October 14, 2021, the Company
issued performance-based stock options to two consultants to purchase an aggregate of 1,334 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price
of 363.00 per share, of which 333 vest upon completion of each of the Phase II clinical trials of AL001 for a BD indication, AL001 for
a PTSD indication, AL001 for an MDD indication and ALZN002 for an Alzheimer s indication. 

On January 19, 2023, the Board
modified the performance criteria for these awards. The revised grant will vest 25 if the Company (a) completes and announces topline

 believes, expects, can, continue, could, estimates, 
 expects, intends, may, plans, potential, predict, 
 should or will or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions;
uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, levels or activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels

In this Quarterly Report,
unless the context requires otherwise, references to the Company, Alzamend, we, our company 
and us refer to Alzamend Neuro, Inc., a Delaware corporation. 

Overview 

We
were incorporated on February 26, 2016, as Alzamend Neuro, Inc. under the laws of the State of Delaware. We were formed to acquire and
commercialize patented intellectual property and know-how to prevent, treat and potentially cure the crippling and deadly Alzheimer s
disease Alzheimer s ). With our two product candidates, we aim to bring treatment or cures not only for Alzheimer s,
but also bipolar disorder BD ), major depressive disorder MDD and post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD ).
Existing Alzheimer s treatments only temporarily relieve symptoms but do not, to our knowledge, slow or halt the underlying progression
of the disease. We have developed a novel approach to combat Alzheimer s through immunotherapy. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Research and Development
Expenses . Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of scientific consulting
fees and lab supplies, as well as fees paid to other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on behalf of our
company. 

We have acquired and may continue
to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize new product candidates from third parties. The upfront payments to acquire license,
product or rights, as well as any future milestone payments, are immediately recognized as research and development expense, provided
that there is no alternative future use of the rights in other research and development projects. 

Stock-Based Compensation. We
maintain a stock-based compensation plan as a long-term incentive for employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The plan allows
for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, and other forms of equity awards. 

We recognize stock-based compensation
expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. Our stock-based
compensation costs are based upon the grant date fair value of options estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. To the
extent any stock option grants are made subject to the achievement of a performance-based milestone, management evaluates when the achievement
of any such performance-based milestone is probable based on the relative satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting
date. 

22 

The Black-Scholes option pricing
model utilizes inputs which are highly subjective assumptions and generally require significant judgment. These assumptions include: 

Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option. 

Expected Volatility. Because we do not have a sufficient trading history for our common
stock Common Stock ), the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded
life sciences companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies were chosen based
on the similar size, stage in life cycle or area of specialty. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical
information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. 

Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards
are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the
end of the contractual term), as we do not have sufficient historical data to use any other method to estimate expected term. 

Expected Dividend Yield. We have never paid dividends on our Common Stock and have
no plans to pay dividends on our Common Stock. Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. 

Certain of these assumptions
involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we
use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation could be materially different. 

Preferred Stock Classification. 
We analyze the terms of our preferred stock using Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity , to determine whether our preferred stock should be classified as a liability or equity, and if classified as equity,
permanent or temporary. Common criteria we consider are redemption provisions, conversion options, cumulative of mandatory fixed dividends,
discretionary dividends based on earning, voting rights and collateral requirements. 

Plan of Operations 

We
intend to develop and commercialize therapeutics and vaccines that are better than existing treatments and have the potential to significantly
improve the lives of individuals afflicted by Alzheimer s, BD, MDD and PTSD. To achieve these goals, we are pursuing the following
key business strategies: 

Advance clinical development of AL001 for Alzheimer s, BD, MDD and PTSD treatment; 

Advance clinical development of ALZN002 for Alzheimer s treatment; 

Expand our pipeline of pharmaceuticals to include additional indications for AL001 and delivery methods; 

Focus on translational and functional endpoints to efficiently develop product candidates; and 

Optimize the value of AL001 and ALZN002 in major markets. 

Our
pipeline consists of two novel therapeutic drug candidates: 

AL001 - A patented ionic cocrystal technology delivering a therapeutic combination of lithium, salicylate
and proline through three royalty-bearing exclusive worldwide licenses from the University of South Florida Research Foundation, Inc.,
as licensor (the Licensor and 

ALZN002 - A patented method using a mutant peptide sensitized cell as a cell-based therapeutic vaccine
that seeks to restore the ability of a patient s immunological system to combat Alzheimer s through a royalty-bearing exclusive
worldwide license from the Licensor. 

23 

Our
most advanced product candidate (lead product) licensed and in clinical development in humans is AL001, an ionic cocrystal of lithium
for the treatment of Alzheimer s, BD, MDD and PTSD. Based on our preclinical data involving mice models, AL001 treatment prevented
cognitive deficits, depression and irritability and is superior in improving associative learning and memory and irritability compared
with lithium carbonate treatments, supporting the potential of this lithium formulation for the treatment of Alzheimer s, BD, MDD
and PTSD in humans. Lithium has been marketed for more than 35 years and human toxicology regarding lithium use has been well characterized,
potentially mitigating the regulatory burden for safety data. 

On
May 5, 2022, we initiated a multiple-dose, steady-state, double-blind, ascending dose safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic clinical trial
of AL001 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer s and healthy subjects. We completed the Phase IIA clinical trial in March
2023 and announced positive topline data in June 2023, followed by the full data set in October 2024. 

We
announced that we successfully identified a maximum tolerated dose MTD for development of AL001 from a multiple-ascending
dose study as assessed by an independent safety review committee. This dose, providing lithium at a lithium carbonate equivalent dose
of 240 mg 3-times daily TID ), is designed to be unlikely to require lithium therapeutic drug monitoring TDM ).
Also, this MTD is risk mitigated for the purpose of treating fragile populations, such as Alzheimer s patients. 

Lithium is a commonly prescribed
drug for manic episodes in BD type 1 as well as maintenance therapy of BD in patients with a history of manic episodes. Lithium is also
prescribed off-label for MDD, BD and treatment of PTSD, among other disorders. Lithium was the first mood stabilizer approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration FDA and is still a first-line treatment option (considered the gold standard but is underutilized perhaps because of the need for TDM. Lithium was the first drug that required TDM by regulatory authorities in product
labelling because the effective and safe range of therapeutic drug blood concentrations is narrow and well defined for treatment of BD
when using lithium salts. Excursions above this range can be toxic, and below can impair effectiveness. Existing lithium drugs suffer
from chronic toxicity, poor physicochemical properties, and poor brain bioavailability. Alzamend s novel AL001 formulation, a lithium-salicylate/L-proline
engineered ionic cocrystal, is designed to overcome the toxicities associated with conventional lithium salts, promising a next-generation
lithium treatment with an enhanced safety profile and advantageous distribution to brain and brain structures. 

Based
on the results from our Phase IIA MAD study, we plan to initiate five clinical trials to determine relative increased lithium levels in
the brain compared to a marketed lithium salt for healthy subject and patients diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer s, BD,
MDD and PTSD, based on published mouse studies that predict that lithium can be given at lower doses for equivalent therapeutic benefit
when treating with AL001. For example, the goal is to replace the amount of lithium needed for maintenance treatment of BD with a clinically
relevant, lower AL001 lithium carbonate equivalent lithium dose. Such lithium dose mitigation could redefine the landscape of neuropsychiatric,
neurodegenerative, and neurological treatment practices. In August 2024, we announced that we had partnered with Massachusetts General
Hospital to serve as the CRO for these clinical trials. 

On
November 19, 2024, we announced final full data set from a nonclinical study comparing brain and plasma lithium exposures between AL001
and lithium carbonate in Alzheimer s transgenic mice. The study was conducted at the University of South Florida and the bioanalytical
procedures for determination of lithium concentration in the brain and plasma samples were conducted under good laboratory practice standards
by Sannova Analytical LLC. The study involved administering AL001, a good manufacturing practices-quality active pharmaceutical ingredient API to 5XFAD mice, a recognized model for Alzheimer s research, to compare its effects against lithium carbonate,
an FDA approved and marketed API. Mice received either high or low doses scaled to humans of both AL001 and lithium carbonate over a 14-day
period to observe pharmacokinetic steady-state drug conditions. On the 15th day, the mice were analyzed to assess how the treatments affected
lithium concentrations in different brain regions and in their plasma. 

Based on the study, both treatments
had no negative impact on the mice's body weight or clinical signs during the treatment period. AL001 showed lower plasma lithium levels
than lithium carbonate, reducing the risk of adverse systemic effects, suggesting an expansion for safety of lithium s therapeutic
index. Further, AL001 showed consistently higher lithium concentrations in brain tissues, particularly at lower doses, compared to lithium
carbonate. Finally, the study found that different brain regions absorb and retain lithium differently. This means treatments can potentially
be tailored to target specific brain areas, allowing for more precise treatment of various brain-related conditions when applied in human
studies. 

These
results highlight the potential clinical advantages of AL001 for conditions like Alzheimer s, BD, MDD and PTSD at low doses. By
reducing the systemic burden, AL001 could lessen the risk of side effects such as thyroid and kidney complications often associated with
extant lithium therapies. This positions AL001 as a promising candidate for safer long-term treatment options, without the need for TDM.
This innovation is specifically designed to address the needs of fragile populations, such as elderly and Alzheimer s patients,
by offering a potentially more efficient and safer alternative to existing treatments. 

24 

The dosing level identified
as optimal in this robust nonclinical study will serve as the foundation for advancing the evaluation of AL001 in the comprehensive Lithium
in Brain Phase II clinical trials. These trials, conducted in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital, will encompass
a diverse cohort of both healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer s disease, BD, MDD and PTSD. 

On
September 28, 2022, we submitted an IND application to the FDA for ALZN002 and received a study may proceed letter on October
31, 2022. The product candidate is an immunotherapy vaccine designed to treat mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer s type.
ALZN002 is a proprietary active immunotherapy product, which means it is produced by each patient s immune system.
It consists of autologous DCs that are activated white blood cells taken from each individual patient so that they can be engineered outside
of the body to attack Alzheimer s-related amyloid-beta proteins. These DCs are pulsed with a novel amyloid-beta peptide (E22W) designed
to bolster the ability of the patient s immune system to combat Alzheimer s, with the goal being to foster tolerance to treatment
for safety purposes while stimulating the immune system to reduce the brain s beta-amyloid protein burden, resulting in reduced
Alzheimer s signs and symptoms. Compared to passive immunization treatment approaches that use foreign blood products (such as monoclonal
antibodies), active immunization with ALZN002 is anticipated to offer a more robust and long-lasting effect on the clearance of amyloid.
This could provide a safer approach due to its reliance on autologous immune components, using each individual patient s own white
blood cells rather than foreign cells and/or blood products. 

On
April 3, 2023, we announced the initiation of a Phase I/IIA clinical trial for ALZN002 to treat mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer s
type. The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of multiple ascending doses of ALZN002 compared with
that of a placebo in 20-30 subjects with mild to moderate morbidity. The primary goal of this clinical trial is to determine an appropriate
dose of ALZN002 for treatment of patients with Alzheimer s in a larger Phase IIB efficacy and safety clinical trial. On February
13, 2024, we received notice from the company we engaged as our contract research organization CRO ), Biorasi, LLC Biorasi that Biorasi was terminating our contract with them. We are currently pursuing the engagement of a replacement CRO. 

The
continuation of our current plan of operations with respect to initiating and conducting the series of human clinical trials for each
of our therapeutics requires us to raise additional capital to fund our operations. 

Because
our working capital requirements depend upon numerous factors, including the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing, timing
and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals, changes in levels of resources that we devote to the development of manufacturing and marketing
capabilities, competitive and technological advances, status of competitors, and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with
other organizations, we will require additional financing to fund future operations.

Revenue 

We
currently have only two product candidates, AL001 and ALZN002. These products are in the clinical stage of development and will require
extensive clinical study, review and evaluation, regulatory review and approval, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment
before either or both of them, and any respective successors, will provide us with any revenue. We did not generate any revenues
during the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, and we do not anticipate that we will generate revenue for the foreseeable future.

Professional Fees 

During the three months ended
October 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred professional fees of 181,000 and 1.0 million, respectively, which were primarily comprised of
professional fees attributed to various types of scientific services, including FDA consulting services. The decrease relates to lower
professional fees incurred related to minimal clinical trial activities. 

Clinical Trial Fees 

During the three months ended
October 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred clinical trial fees of 124,000 and 795,000, respectively. Clinical trial fees for the three months

October 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred research and development stock-based compensation expense of nil and 143,000, respectively, related
to stock option grants and restricted stock grants to executives, employees and consultants. The decrease in stock-based compensation
expense for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was a result of fewer stock options vesting during the period compared to the prior
year period. 

Other Research and Development Expenses 

During the three months ended
October 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred other fees of 6,000 and 14,000, respectively, which were primarily comprised of scientific materials

During the three months ended
October 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred 326,000 and 226,000, respectively, in employee-related expenses. The increase in salaries and
benefits was due to a bonus paid to our chief executive officer. As of October 31, 2024, we had four full-time and three part-time employees.

 13,000 in tax preparation fees, 12,000 in related party consulting, and 11,000 in Sarbanes-Oxley compliance fees. The decrease in professional
fees was due mainly to lower investor relations and legal fees.

expense for the three months ended October 31, 2024, was a result of fewer stock options vesting during the period compared to the prior
year period. 

Marketing Fees 

During the three months ended October 31, 2024
and 2023, we incurred marketing fees of 304,000 and nil, respectively. The increase was due to a marketing program launched to promote

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The accompanying condensed
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We have incurred recurring net losses and operations
have not provided sufficient cash flows. We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least
the time we are able to generate revenues from operations. We believe our current cash on hand is
insufficient to fund our planned operations through one year after the date the condensed financial statements are issued. These factors
create substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year after the date that our condensed financial
statements are issued. 

Our inability to continue as
a going concern could have a negative impact on our company, including our ability to obtain needed financing.
We intend to finance our future development activities and our working capital needs largely through the sale of equity securities with
some additional funding from other sources, including debt financing, until such time as funds provided by operations are sufficient to
fund working capital requirements. Our condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue
as a going concern. As of October 31, 2024, we had cash of 4.1 million, working capital of 3.5 million, an accumulated deficit of 56.4
million and stockholders equity of 3.8 million. For the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, we had net losses of 1.4
million and 2.4 million, respectively. For the six months ended October 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 4.5 million.
Historically, we have financed our operations principally through issuances of equity and debt instruments. 

We will need to obtain substantial
additional funding in the future for our clinical development activities and continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital
when needed or on favorable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization
efforts. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials; 

our ability to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical
trials and, if our product candidates are approved, commercial manufacturing; 

31 

our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and establish new research and development
programs; 

addition and retention of key research and development personnel; 

our efforts to enhance operational, financial, and information management systems, and hire additional
personnel, including personnel to support development of our product candidates; 

negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter
and performing our obligations in such collaborations; 

the timing and amount of milestone and other payments we may receive under our collaboration arrangements; 

our eventual commercialization plans for our product candidates; 

the costs involved in prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property
claims; and 

the costs and timing of regulatory approvals. 

A change in the outcome of
any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs
and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we
may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.

January 31, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement AL SPA with Ault Lending, LLC Ault Lending whereby Ault Lending may purchase of up to 6,000 shares of series B convertible preferred stock Series B Convertible Preferred

warrants in excess of the Nasdaq Limit, which is 19.99 of our shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the execution
date of the Orchid SPA. We held a special meeting of stockholders on July 8, 2024, at which time, the stockholders approved the issuance
of all the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the exercise of the warrants
in excess of the Nasdaq Limit. 

33 

The
 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has a stated value of 10,000 per share Series
A Stated Value and accrues dividends at the rate of 15 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears in cash or paid-in-kind
shares, in Orchid s sole discretion. Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into a number of shares of
common stock determined by dividing the Series A Stated Value by (y)
the greater of (i) the Floor Price and (ii) the lesser of (A) 15.00 and (B) 80 of the lowest closing price of our common stock during
the three trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion into conversion shares (the Series
A Conversion Price ). The Series A Conversion Price is subject to adjustment
in the event of an issuance of common stock at a price per share lower than the Series A Conversion
Price then in effect, as well as upon customary stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or similar events. The holders of the Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the common stock as a single class on an as-converted basis, subject to applicable
law provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and Nasdaq, provided however, that for purposes of complying with Nasdaq regulations,
the conversion price, for purposes of determining the number of votes the holder of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to
cast, shall not be lower than 5.63 (the Series A Voting Floor Price ), which represents the closing sale price of the common
stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date of execution of the Orchid SPA. The Series A Voting Floor Price shall be adjusted
for stock dividends, stock splits, stock combinations and other similar transactions. 

The warrants have an exercise
price of 12.50 (the Series A Exercise Price and are exercisable upon issuance
and have a five-year term, expiring on the fifth anniversary of issuance. The Series A Exercise
Price is subject to adjustment in the event of an issuance of common stock at a price per share lower than the Series
A Exercise Price then in effect, as well as upon customary stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or similar events. The warrants
are exercisable on a cashless basis in the event that there is not then an effective resale registration statement for the common stock
issuable upon exercise of the warrants. 

At-the-Market Offering 

On October 3, 2024, we entered
into an At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement with Ascendiant Capital Markets, LLC (the ATM Offering ), as sales agent to
sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to approximately 6.5 million from time to time, through the
ATM Offering. On October 3, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC relating to the offer and sale of up to approximately
 6.5 million in shares of common stock in the ATM Offering. 

The offer and sale of the
shares will be made pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and an accompanying base prospectus
contained therein (Registration Statement No. 333-273610) filed with the SEC on August 2, 2023 and declared effective by the SEC
on August 10, 2023. 

During the six months ended
October 31, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 755,888 shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Offering for gross and net proceeds of 1.2
million. From November 1, 2024 to December 10, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 201,543 shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Offering
for gross and net proceeds of 280,000. 

Cash Flows 

The following table summarizes
our cash flows for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023: 

For the Six Months Ended October 31,

Operating Activities 

During the six months ended
October 31, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 4.5 million. This consisted primarily of a net loss of 2.4 million and a
decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities of 2.3 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of 197,000. The non-cash charges
primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense. The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was due to a decrease
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. 

Investing Activities 

During the six months ended
October 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 90,000 from the purchase of equipment. We purchased equipment, which measures
lithium levels in the brain, to be used in the AL001 clinical trial. 

34 

Financing Activities 

During the six months ended
October 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 8.3 million. This consisted of 7.1 million from the sale of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock and 1.2 million from the sale of common stock from our ATM Offering. 

Contractual Obligations 

On July 2, 2018, we entered
into two Standard Exclusive License Agreements with Sublicensing Terms for AL001 with the Licensor and its affiliate, the University of
South Florida (the AL001 Licenses ), pursuant to which the Licensor granted us a royalty bearing exclusive worldwide licenses
limited to the field of Alzheimer s, under United States Patent Nos. (i) 9,840,521, entitled Organic Anion Lithium Ionic
Cocrystal Compounds and Compositions, filed September 24, 2015 and granted December 12, 2017, and (ii) 9,603,869, entitled Lithium
Co-Crystals for Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Disorders, filed May 21, 2016 and granted March 28, 2017. On February 1, 2019, we
entered into the First Amendments to the AL001 Licenses, on March 30, 2021, we entered into the Second Amendments to the AL001 Licenses
and on June 8, 2023, we entered into the Third Amendments to the AL001 Licenses (collectively, the AL001 License Agreements ).
The Third Amendments to the AL001 Licenses modified the timing of the payments of the license fees. 

The AL001 License Agreements
require that we pay combined royalty payments of 4.5 on net sales of products developed from the licensed technology for AL001. We have
already paid an initial license fee of 200,000 for AL001. As an additional licensing fee for the license of the AL001 technologies, the
Licensor received 14,853 shares of our common stock. Minimum royalties for AL001 License Agreements are 40,000 on the first anniversary
of the first commercial sale, 80,000 on the second anniversary of the first commercial sale and 100,000 on the third anniversary of
the first commercial sale and every year thereafter, for the life of the AL001 License Agreements. 

On May 1, 2016, we entered
into a Standard Exclusive License Agreement with Sublicensing Terms for ALZN002 with the Licensor (the ALZN002 License ),
pursuant to which the Licensor granted us a royalty bearing exclusive worldwide license limited to the field of Alzheimer s Immunotherapy
and Diagnostics, under United States Patent No. 8,188,046, entitled Amyloid Beta Peptides and Methods of Use, filed April
7, 2009 and granted May 29, 2012. On August 18, 2017, we entered into the First Amendment to the ALZN002 License, on May 7, 2018, we entered
into the Second Amendment to the ALZN002 License, on January 31, 2019, we entered into the Third Amendment to the ALZN002 License, on
January 24, 2020, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the ALZN002 License, on March 30, 2021, we entered into the Fifth Amendment
to the ALZN002 License, on April 17, 2023, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to the ALZN002 License and on December 11, 2023, we entered
into the Seventh Amendment to the ALZN002 License (collectively, the ALZN002 License Agreement ). The Seventh Amendment to
the ALZN002 License modified the timing of the payments of the license fees. 

The ALZN002 License Agreement
requires us to pay royalty payments of 4 on net sales of products developed from the licensed technology for ALZN002. We have already
paid an initial license fee of 200,000 for ALZN002. As an additional licensing fee for the license of ALZN002, the Licensor received
24,012 shares of our common stock. Minimum royalties for ALZN002 are 20,000 on the first anniversary of the first commercial sale, 40,000
on the second anniversary of the first commercial sale and 50,000 on the third anniversary of the first commercial sale and every year
thereafter, for the life of the ALZN002 License Agreement. 

On November 19, 2019, we entered
into two Standard Exclusive License Agreements with Sublicensing Terms for two additional indications of AL001 with the Licensor (the
 November AL001 License ), pursuant to which the Licensor granted us a royalty bearing exclusive worldwide licenses limited
to the fields of (i) neurodegenerative diseases excluding Alzheimer s and (ii) psychiatric diseases and disorders. On March 30,
2021, we entered into the First Amendments to the November AL001 License and on April 17, 2023, we entered into the Second Amendments
to the November AL001 License (collectively, the November AL001 License Agreements ). The Second Amendments to the November
AL001 License modified the timing of the payments of the license fees. 

The November AL001 License
Agreements require us to pay royalty payments of 3 on net sales of products developed from the licensed technology for AL001 in those
fields. We paid an initial license fee of 20,000 for the additional indications. Minimum royalties for November AL001 License Agreements
are 40,000 on the first anniversary of the first commercial sale, 80,000 on the second anniversary of the first commercial sale and
 100,000 on the third anniversary of the first commercial sale and every year thereafter, for the life of the November AL001 License Agreements. 

These license agreements have
an indefinite term that continue until the later of the date no licensed patent under the applicable agreement remains a pending application
or enforceable patent, the end date of any period of market exclusivity granted by a governmental regulatory body, or the date on which
the licensee s obligations to pay royalties expire under the applicable license agreement. Under our various license agreements,
if we fail to meet a milestone by its specified date, Licensor may terminate the license agreement. The Licensor was also granted a preemptive
right to acquire such shares or other equity securities that may be issued from time to time by us while the Licensor remains the owner
of any equity securities of our company. 

35 

Additionally, we are required
to complete milestones and make payments on the due dates to the Licensor for the license of the AL001 technologies and for the ALZN002
technology, as follows:

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Because we are a smaller reporting
company, this section is not applicable. 

36 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We have established disclosure
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, with the assistance of other members of the Company s management, have evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based upon our evaluation, each of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective
as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because the Company has not yet completed its remediation of
the material weakness previously identified and disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30,
2024, the end of its most recent fiscal year. 

Specifically, management has
 identified the following material weaknesses: 

1. we do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which
restricts our ability to perform sufficient reviews and approval of manual journal entries posted to the general ledger and to consistently
execute review procedures over general ledger account reconciliations, financial statement preparation and accounting for non-routine
transactions ; and 

2. our primary user access controls (i.e., provisioning, de-provisioning,
privileged access and user access reviews) to ensure appropriate authorization and segregation of duties that would adequately restrict
user and privileged access to the financially relevant systems and data to appropriate personnel were not designed and/or implemented
effectively. We did not design and/or implement sufficient controls for program change management to certain financially relevant systems
affecting our processes . 

A material weakness is a control
deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

Planned Remediation 

We are implementing measures
designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate material weaknesses, including the following: 

Continue to formalize our internal control documentation and strengthening supervisory reviews by our
management; and 

Developing plans to add additional accounting personnel and segregating duties amongst accounting personnel. 

Management continues to work
to improve its controls related to our material weaknesses, specifically relating to user access and change management surrounding our
information technology systems and applications. Management will continue to implement measures to remediate material weaknesses, such
that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: (i) enhancing design and documentation
related to both user access and change management processes and control activities; and (ii) developing and communicating additional policies
and procedures to govern the area of information technology change management. In order to achieve the timely implementation of the above,
management has commenced the following actions and will continue to assess additional opportunities for remediation on an ongoing basis: 

Engaging a third-party specialist to assist management with improving the Company s overall control
environment, focusing on change management and access controls; and 

Implementing new applications and systems that are aligned with management s focus on creating strong
internal controls. 

We are currently working to
improve and simplify our internal processes and implement enhanced controls, as discussed above, to address the material weaknesses in
our internal control over financial reporting and to remedy the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. These material
weaknesses will not be considered to be remediated until the applicable remediated controls are operating for a sufficient period of time
and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

37 

Despite the existence of these
material weaknesses, we believe that the condensed financial statements included in the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Changes in Internal Control 

Except as detailed above,
during the quarter ended October 31, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

38 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may
be subject to legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to or aware of any proceedings that we believe will have, individually or
in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Regardless of the outcome,
litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

The risks described in Part
I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our Common Stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify
all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider
to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable
indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The Risk Factors
section of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K remains current in all material respects. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

On
August 19, 2024, we sold 200 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 160,000 shares of common stock with
an exercise price of 12.50, for a total purchase price of 2.0 million. The purchase price was paid in cash. 

On
August 21, 2024, we sold 250 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock with
an exercise price of 12.50, for a total purchase price of 2.5 million less 100,000 discount. The purchase price was paid in cash. 

On
September 11, 2024, we sold 100 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 80,000 shares of common stock
with an exercise price of 12.50, for a total purchase price of 1.0 million. The purchase price was paid in cash.
