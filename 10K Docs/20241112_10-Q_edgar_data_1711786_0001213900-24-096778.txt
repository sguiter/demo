. The Company is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing new generation
therapies for unmet medical needs. The Company is focused on developing (i) a topical formulation for treating side effects from drugs
used for the treatment of cancer (HT-001); (ii) a treatment for mast-cell derived cancers and anaphylaxis (HT-KIT); (iii) a treatment
for traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke (HT-TBI); and (iv) a treatment and/or prevention for Alzheimer s or other neuroinflammatory
diseases (HT-ALZ). The Company also has assets being developed for (i) atopic dermatitis (also known as eczema) (BioLexa); (ii) a treatment
for asthma and allergies using inhalational administration (HT-004); and (iii) a treatment for acne as well as inflammatory bowel diseases
(HT-003). The Company also has interests in certain other assets being developed by third parties including a treatment for patients with
lupus that is being developed by Zyl Therapeutics, Inc. and potential product candidates being developed pursuant to its agreement
with Voltron Therapeutics, Inc. for the prevention of COVID-19 (see Note 4 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
for a discussion of the Company s agreement with Zyl Therapeutics, Inc.). 

Liquidity and capital resources 

Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern , requires management to evaluate the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern one year beyond the filing date of the given financial statements. This evaluation requires management
to perform two steps. First, management must evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s
ability to continue as a going concern. Second, if management concludes that substantial doubt is raised, management is required to consider
whether it has plans in place to alleviate that doubt. Disclosures in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
are required if management concludes that substantial doubt exists or that its plans alleviate the substantial doubt that was raised. 

The Company has incurred losses and generated
negative cash flows from operations since its inception. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million
and cash and cash equivalents of million. The Company has funded its operations from proceeds from the sale of equity and debt securities.
The Company will require significant additional capital to make the investments it needs to execute its longer-term business plan. The
Company s ability to successfully raise sufficient funds through the sale of debt or equity securities when needed is subject to
many risks and uncertainties and, even if it were successful, future equity issuances may result in dilution to its existing shareholders
and future debt securities may contain covenants that limit the Company s operations or ability to enter into certain transactions. 

The Company believes its current cash is sufficient
to fund operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of these financial statements. However, the Company will need
to raise additional funding, through strategic relationships, public or private equity or debt financings, grants or other arrangements,
to develop and seek regulatory approvals for the Company s current and future product candidates. If such funding is not available,
or not available on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company s current development plan and plans for expansion of its general
and administrative infrastructure may be curtailed. 

On April 1, 2024, in connection with the March
27, 2024 inducement offer agreement with a holder (the Holder of certain of the Company s existing warrants (the
 January 2023 Existing Warrants to exercise, for cash, an aggregate of of the January 2023 Existing Warrants to
purchase shares of the Company s common stock at a reduced exercise price of per share, the Holder exercised the 
January 2023 Existing Warrants and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued shares of the Company s
common stock (the Warrant Shares for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately million before deducting placement
agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company.

related to in-licensed products and technology; 

expenses
incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials

costs
associated with non-clinical activities and regulatory approvals.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
general and administrative expenses amounted to approximately 1.2 million as compared to 1.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2023, an increase of approximately 116,100, or 10.4 . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative
expenses consisted of the following:

 1,118,606 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, the increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately 116,100 was primarily attributed to an
increase compensation and related expenses of approximately 54,500, an increase in other general and administrative expenses of
approximately 79,400, and an increase in rent expense of approximately 8,400, offset by a decrease in professional and consulting
expenses of approximately 26,200. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we received a vendor credit of approximately 139,400, which
reduced our other general and administrative expenses for the period. We did not receive any credit in the 2024 period. This reduction
of other general administrative expenses was offset by an increase in insurance expense and other general and administrative expenses. 

We anticipate that our general and administrative
expenses will increase in future periods, reflecting continued and increasing costs associated with: 

support
of our research and development activities; 

stock
compensation granted to key employees and non-employees; 

support
of business development activities; and 

increased
professional fees and other costs associated with regulatory requirements. 

Other income (expenses) 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we recorded other income, net of approximately 200 and 6,400, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2023,
we recorded dividend income of approximately 5,600 as compared to 200 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Net Loss 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we incurred a net loss of approximately 2.1 million, or 0.31 per common share (basic and diluted), and 2.1 million, or 0.60
per common share (basic and diluted), respectively, a decrease of approximately 45,500. 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 

Operating Costs and Expenses 

Research and Development Expenses 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
research and development expenses decreased by approximately 635,700, or 24.8 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
research and development expenses were approximately 1.9 million. Specifically, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our
research and development costs consisted primarily of the following costs for each of our key research and development projects: (i) HT-001,
approximately 1.2 million related to manufacturing, preclinical and clinical activities; (ii) HT-ALZ, approximately 112,800 related
to preclinical studies; (iii) HT-KIT, approximately 363,300 related to manufacturing and preclinical activities; and (iv) HT-004, approximately
 96,100 in sponsored research activities. In addition to the foregoing, we also incurred fees of approximately 111,800 payable to members
of our scientific advisory board for services. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
research and development expenses were approximately 2.6 million, of which approximately 2.8 million was related to research and development
expenses, with an offsetting gain of approximately 275,000 related to licenses acquired. Specifically, during the nine months ended September
30, 2023, our research and development costs consisted primarily of the following costs for each of our key research and development projects:
(i) BioLexa, approximately 52,400 related to manufacturing costs; (ii) HT-001, approximately 1.3 million related to manufacturing, preclinical
and clinical activities; (iii) HT-KIT, approximately 1.4 million related to manufacturing and preclinical activities; (iv) HT-ALZ, approximately
 48,900 related to sponsored research; (v) HT-004, approximately 26,000 related to sponsored research; and (vi) HT-TBI credit of approximately
 11,900 related to manufacturing. In addition to the foregoing, we also incurred fees of approximately 143,600 payable to members of
our scientific advisory board for services. Additionally, our subsidiary, Hoth Therapeutics Australia Pty Ltd, recorded a gain of approximately
 0.3 million due to a settlement agreement on a payable balance with Novotech, a clinical trial management vendor. 

We expect our research and development activities
to increase as we develop our existing product candidates and potentially acquire new product candidates, reflecting increasing costs
associated with the following: 

employee-related
expenses, which include salaries and benefits, and rent expenses; 

fees
related to in-licensed products and technology; 

expenses
incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials
and a substantial portion of our pre-clinical activities; 

the
cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials; and 

costs
associated with non-clinical activities and regulatory approvals. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
general and administrative expenses amounted to approximately 3,902,500 as compared to 3,429,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, an increase of 473,500, or 13.8 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses
consisted of the following:

- 23 - 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately 473,500 was primarily attributed to an
increase other general and administrative expenses of approximately 182,400, which primarily consisted of an increase in conference
fees of approximately 161,000, an increase in compensation and related expenses of approximately 457,900, comprising of an
increase in stock-based compensation of approximately 607,600 related to the issuance of stock options to executives and board of
director members, and an increase in rent of approximately 10,100, offset by a decrease in other compensation and related expenses
of approximately 149,700, and a decrease in professional and consulting expenses of approximately 176,900. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, we received a vendor credit of approximately 139,400, which reduced our other general and administrative
expenses for the period. We did not receive any credit in the 2024 period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
increase in other general and administrative was also attributable to an increase in insurance expense and other general and
administrative expenses. 

We anticipate that our general and administrative
expenses will increase in future periods, reflecting continued and increasing costs associated with: 

support
of our research and development activities; 

stock
compensation granted to key employees and non-employees; 

support
of business development activities; and 

increased
professional fees and other costs associated with regulatory requirements. 

Other income (expenses) 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, we recorded other income (expenses), net of approximately 27,000 and (148,700), respectively, an increase in other income of 175,700.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an unrealized loss of marketable securities of approximately 184,800 as
compared to 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net Loss 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, we incurred a net loss of approximately 5.8 million, or 0.96 per common share (basic and diluted), and 6.1 million, or 1.99
per common share (basic and diluted), respectively, a decrease of approximately 0.3 million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

To date we have funded our operations primarily
through the sale of equity and debt securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 8.0 million in cash and cash equivalents,
working capital of approximately 7.4 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately 58.7 million. Net cash used in operating activities
was 5.0 million and 5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We incurred net losses of approximately
 5.8 million and 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have incurred substantial operating
losses since inception and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our pre-clinical
and clinical development of our product candidates. We have not yet commercialized any products and have never generated any revenue from
product sales. We believe that our existing cash as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements for at least 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 2,500,000 shares (the Warrant Shares of our common stock upon
the exercise of the 2,500,000 January 2023 Existing Warrants (as defined herein) for net proceeds of approximately 3.8 million, after
deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses of approximately 0.4 million. The Warrant Shares were issued as a result of
a March 27, 2024 inducement offer agreement, which closed on April 1, 2024, with a holder (the Holder of certain of our
existing warrants January 2023 Existing Warrants to immediately exercise, for cash, an aggregate of 2,500,000 January
2023 Existing Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at a reduced exercise price of 1.6775 per share. 

- 24 - 

As an inducement to such exercise, we issued new
unregistered warrants to the warrant holder to purchase up to 3,750,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 1.50 per share.
The warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire on July 3, 2028. Additionally, in connection with this exercise,
we issued 125,000 placement agent warrants at an exercise price of 2.0969 per share. The placement agent warrants are exercisable immediately
upon issuance and will expire on July 3, 2028. 

We have entered into certain license, sublicense,
sponsored research and option agreements with third parties. Pursuant to such agreements, we may be required to make certain: (i) license
maintenance fee payments; (ii) out-of-pocket expense payments, including, but not limited to, payments related to intellectual property
and research related expenses; (iii) development and commercialization expense payments; (iv) annual and quarterly minimum payments; (v)
diligence expense payments; and (vi) revenue interest payments. In addition, subject to the achievement of certain development and/or
commercialization events, we may also be required to make certain: (i) minimum royalty payments, ranging from middle to high five figures;
(ii) sales-based royalties and running royalties, ranging from low single digits to low double digits; and (iii) milestone payments of
up to approximately 10.5 million (if all milestones in all of our current agreements are achieved). 

Additional funding will be necessary to fund our
future clinical and pre-clinical activities. We may obtain additional financing through sales of our equity and debt securities, entering
into strategic partnerships, grants or other arrangements, or a combination of the foregoing. There are no assurances that we will be
successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing as and when needed to finance our operations on terms acceptable to us or at all,
particularly in light of the economic downturn. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding as and when needed, we may have
to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
net cash used in operations was approximately 5.0 million, which primarily resulted from a net loss of approximately 5.8 million, adjusted
for the add back of stock-based compensation of approximately 0.8 million. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2023, net cash used in operations was approximately 5.4 million, which primarily resulted from a net loss of approximately 6.1
million, adjusted for the add back of stock-based compensation of approximately 210,600 and unrealized loss on marketable
securities of 184,800, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 397,000, which consisted of an
increase in prepaid expenses of 141,100 and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately 538,100. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

2023, there was no net cash provided by or used in investing activities. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 3.7 million, which resulted from net proceeds from the exercise of warrants. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 11.3 million, which resulted from net proceeds from the issuance of common
stock and warrants and proceeds from the exercise of warrants. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management considers an accounting estimate
to be critical if: 

it
requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and 

changes
in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have material impact in our results of operations or financial
condition. 

- 25 - 

While we base our estimates and judgments on our
experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ from those
estimates and the differences could be material. 

See Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for an additional discussion of our significant accounting policies. 

Stock-based compensation 

The Company accounts for stock-based payment awards
exchanged for services at the estimated grant date fair value of the award. Stock options issued under the Company s long-term incentive
plans are granted with an exercise price equal to no less than the market price of the Company s stock at the date of grant and
expire up to ten years from the date of grant. Options are generally issued fully vested. The Company accounts for forfeited awards as
they occur. 

The Company estimates the fair value of stock
option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards
represent management s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. 

Expected Term - The
expected term of options represents the period that the Company s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the
simplified method, which is the half-life from vesting to the end of its contractual term. 

Expected Volatility 
- The Company computes stock price volatility over expected terms based on its historical common stock trading prices. 

Risk-Free Interest Rate 
- The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent
remaining term. 

Expected Dividend 
- The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common shares and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable
future, and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in its valuation models. 

The Company grants restricted stock awards under
its equity incentive plan. Restricted stock awards are granted to employees and non-employees. The restricted stock awards are measured
based on the grant-date fair value. In general, the restricted stock awards vest over a service period of zero to three years. Stock-based
compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted
for as they occur. 

The Company has issued warrants to non-employees.
The warrants are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, the warrants vest over a term of zero to ten years. Stock-based
compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the vesting term. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet
Effective or Adopted 

Income Taxes (Topic 740) 

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued guidance within Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740):
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The amendments in the ASU are intended to provide more transparency about income tax information
through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The ASU
requires disclosure in the rate reconciliation of specific categories as well as additional information for reconciling items that meet
a quantitative threshold. 

The ASU requires disclosure of the following information
about income taxes paid on an annual basis: 

Income
taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by federal and state taxes and by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes
paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). 

Income
tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal and state jurisdictions. 

The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2024. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is evaluating the impact that the adoption
of this ASU will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements, as it may require additional disclosures in the notes
to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

- 26 - 

Segment Reporting (Topic 280) 

In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance within
ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . This ASU requires that a public entity
that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this ASU and all existing disclosures in
Topic 280. The Company has determined that its current business and operations consist of a single business segment and a single reporting
unit. 

The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve
segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The key amendments included
in this ASU: 

Require
disclosure on an annual and interim basis, of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision
maker CODM and are included within each reported measure of segment profit and loss. 

Require
disclosure on an annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items (defined in this ASU) and a description of its composition. 

Clarify
that if the CODM uses more than one measure of the segment s profit or loss in assessing performance, one or more of those additional
measures may be reported. 

Require
disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or
loss in assessing performance. 

This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments should be applied retrospectively
to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s
condensed consolidated financial statements as the Company has a single reportable segment. 

Management does not believe that any other recently
issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements. 

JOBS Act 

On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups
Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company 
can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised
accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards
until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We have chosen to take advantage of the extended
transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards until
those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not
be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

Subject to certain conditions set forth in the
JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including, without limitation,
(i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b)
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information
about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company 
until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more; (ii)
the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering, which would be December 31,
2024; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the
date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The Company is not required to provide the information
required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end
of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such
date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control 

There have been no significant changes in our
internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute
assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may be subject to litigation
and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings and we are not aware
of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results, cash flows or financial condition. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Risk factors that affect our business and financial
results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023 as filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024 Annual Report ). Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes
in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report. You should carefully consider the risks described below and
in our Annual Report which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below and
in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the
risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected. 

If we fail to comply
with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock
and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. 

On October 30, 2024,
we received written notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of our common stock had been below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. In
accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810, we have a period of 180 calendar days, or until April 28, 2025, to regain compliance with
the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed 1.00 per share
for at least 10 consecutive business days during this 180 calendar day period. In the event we do not regain compliance by April 28,
2025, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period if we meet The Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing
requirements, with the exception of bid price, and notify Nasdaq in writing of our intention to cure the deficiency during
the second compliance period. Although we may effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock in the future,
there can be no assurance that such reverse stock split will enable us to regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement.
