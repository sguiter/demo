The
Company has accumulated deficit of and wo rking capital deficit of as of September 30, 2024. The Company s
continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations
and/or obtain additional financing, as may be required. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above con dition
raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may
result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

In
order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plans
to obtain such resources for the Company include (1) obtaining capital from the sale of its equity securities, (2) sales of the Company s
products, (3) short-term and long-term borrowings from banks, and (4) short-term borrowings from stockholders or other related
party (ies) when needed. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of
its plans. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually to secure
other sources of financing and attain profitable operations.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with our consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto and other financial information, which are included elsewhere in this Report. Our financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our financial statements and the financial information included
in this Report reflect our organizational transactions and have been prepared as if our current corporate structure had been in place
throughout the relevant periods. 

Overview 

We
were incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 7, 2019. We are a travel service provider. We currently provide car services to
individual and group travelers. We currently offer carpooling, airport pick-up and drop-off, and personal driver services for travelers
between Guangdong Province and Hong Kong. We collaborate with car fleet companies and charge a service fee by matching the traveler and
the driver. We officially launched our online service through our Let s Go mobile application in Dece mber 2019
to provide multi-language services to international travelers coming to visit China. Redefining the user experience, we aim to provide
our users with comprehensive and convenient service offerings and become a one-stop travel booking resource for travelers. While network
scale is important, we recognize that transportation happens locally. We currently operate in two markets Guangdong Province and
Hong Kong and plan to expand our offering in more oversea markets. 

Plan of Operations 

In
January 2019, we started our Research and Development R D project mobile Lets Go App App designed
to have multi-language interface to attract users from around the world, focusing on providing one-stop travel services to foreigners
traveling in China, f or both leisure and business. 

In
April 2019, we rolled out basic version which supports carpooling, car rental, airport pick-up and/or drop-off, etc., ready for download
at Apple App store; the basic version has an interface in Chinese language only. In May 2019, we rolled out the second version which has
an enhanced interface in both Chinese and English language which supports payment through PayPal. By the end of 2019, we rolled out third
version of the App which has multi-language interface to attract users from all-over the world. In January 2020, we officially
launched the App. 

We intend to attract users from outside of China
to use our App and expand our offerings on the App to serve as a one-stop shop to book tickets, reserve hotels, rent a car and hire English
speaking drivers. 

Our goal is to grow to an international player
in the travel service market. To accomplish such goal, we will cooperate with other businesses which have capital, marketing and technology
resources or products. We expect to recruit more workforce and talents, and develop new technologies and products. 

Results of Operations 

For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, revenues were 15,885 and 38,102, respectively, with a decrease of 22,217 over the same period in 2023. The decrease in revenue
was mainly due to the Company not providing technology development service to the Company s clients for the three months ended September
30, 2024. Universe Travel providing technology development services to Shenzhen Zhongke Hengjin Technology Co., Ltd in the amount of 14,724
during the three months ended September 30, 2023. There was no technology development service provided for the same period ended 2024,
thus revenue decreased in such quarter. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenues were 52,038 and
 141,496, respectively , with a decrease of 89,458 over
the same period in 2023. The decrease in revenue was mainly due to the Company not providing technology development service to t he
Company s clients for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. From January to September 2023, Universe Travel provided technology
development services to its three major clients, Shenzhen Eryuechuer Culture Technology., Ltd, Shenzhen Shangjia Electronic Technology.,
Ltd and Shenzhen Zhongke Hengjin Technology Co., Ltd, which generated 81,637 in revenue for the Company during the nine month ended September
30, 2023. 

10 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost
of Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were
 7,406 and 19,944, respectively, with a decrease of 12,538 over the same period in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease
of revenue, thus the cost of revenue also decreased accordingly. 

Cost
of Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were
 28,487 and 65,415, resp ectively,
with a decrease of 36,928 over the same period in 2023. The decrease was mainly
due to the decrease of revenue, thus the cost of revenue also decreased accordingly. 

Gross Profit 

Gross
profits were 8,479 and 18,158 for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023. The gross profit margin as a percentage of sales were 53.4 and 47.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue is mostly generated from Universe Travel. Due to the
fact that Universe Travel operates in Mainland China which has a lower cost than operating in Hong Kong, this resulted in higher gross
profit during this quarter. 

Gross profits were 23,551 and 76,081 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The gross profit margin as a percentage of sales for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 and 2023
were 45.3 and 53.8 , respectively. The decrease of gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same
period of 2023 was due to the fact that technology development services accounted for lower proportion of revenue for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. Technology development services have a higher gross profit margin, thus the gross profit margin decreased compared
to the same period last year. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 26,984 and 31,965, respectively, for a decrease of 4,981.
The decrease of operating expenses was mainly due to decrease of service fees paid for other consulting services as compared to the prior
period. 

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 126,580 and 192,374, respectively,
a decrease of 65,794 from the same period in 2023. The decrease of operating expenses was mainly due to decrease of service fees
paid for other consulting services as compared to the prior period. 

Other (Expense)Income 

Other
income consists of interest income and exchange gain (loss) for the three months ended September 30 , 2024 and 2023, the net other
expense was 855 compared to net other income 6 for the same period last year. This was mainly due to the change of exchange rate and
the increase of average cash balances. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net other expense was 925 when it was a net other income of 83 in the
same period last year. This was mainly due to the change of exchange rate and the increase of average cash balances. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have suffered recurring losses from operations
and have an accumulated deficit of 828,374 as of September 30, 2024. We had a cash balance of 8,898 and negative working capital of
 624,087 as of September 30, 2024. We have incurred losses of 103,954 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our financial statements
have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern; however, the above condition raises substantial doubt about our ability
to do so. We have not continually generated significant gross profits. Unless our operations generate a significant increase in gross
profit and cash flows from operating activities, our continued operations will depend on whether we are able to raise additional funds
through various sources, such as equity and debt financing, other collaborative agreements and/or strategic alliances. Our management
is actively engaged in seeking additional capital to fund our operations in the short to medium term. Such additional funds may not become
available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional funding that we do obtain will be sufficient to meet our
needs in the long term. 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 101,811, compared to 134,131 net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 96,134, compared to net cash provided
by financing activities of 94,485 in the same period of 2023. The net cash provided by financing activities were from shareholders who
paid certain expenses on behalf of the Company. 

11 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern; however, the above condition raises substantial doubt about our ability
to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

In order to continue as a going concern, we will
need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plans to obtain such resources include (1) obtaining
capital from the sale of its equity securities, (2) sales of the Company s services, (3) short-term and long-term borrowings from
banks, and (4) short-term borrowings from stockholders or other related party (ies) when needed. However, management cannot provide any
assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of us to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually to secure other sources of financing
and attain profitable operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts,
the useful life of property and equipment and intangible assets, and the valuation of equity transactions. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future
changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

See Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to make disclosures under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation and supervision
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
