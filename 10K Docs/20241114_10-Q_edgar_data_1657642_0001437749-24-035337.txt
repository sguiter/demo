million, with the Bank as the surviving bank. The purpose of this acquisition was to facilitate the Bank's entry into Eastern Tennessee. The transaction closed and the merger of JCB with and into the Bank became effective on September 1, 2024. The Company was considered the acquiror and JCB was considered the acquiree in the transaction for accounting purposes. Pursuant to the JCB merger, the Company acquired million of assets, including million in loans and assumed million in liabilities, including million of deposits, on September 1, 2024. Such amounts include preliminary estimated fair value adjustments, which are subject to change. 

For purposes of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, all information contained herein as of and for periods prior to September 1, 2024 reflects the operations of the Company prior to the JCB merger. Unless this report otherwise indicates or the context otherwise requires, all references to the Company as of and for periods subsequent to September 1, 2024 refer to the combined company and its subsidiary as a combined entity after the merger, and all references to the Company as of and for periods prior to September 1, 2024 are references to the Company and its subsidiary as a combined entity prior to the merger. 

The Bank was organized under the laws of the United States in 1900 and now serves the Virginia counties of Grayson, Floyd, Carroll, Wythe, Pulaski, Montgomery, Roanoke, Patrick and Washington, the North Carolina counties of Alleghany, Ashe, Burke, Caldwell, Catawba, Cleveland, Davie, Iredell, Watauga, Wilkes, and Yadkin, and the Tennessee county of Johnson, and the surrounding areas, through twenty-eight full-service banking offices and two loan production offices. As a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured national banking association, the Bank is subject to regulation by the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. The Company is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve ). 

thousand, which is presented as a reduction to net loans outstanding, and an increase in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments of thousand, which is recorded within Other Liabilities. The Company recorded a net decrease to retained earnings of thousand as of January 1, 2023 for the cumulative effect of adopting CECL, which reflects the transition adjustments noted above, net of the applicable deferred tax assets recorded. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under CECL while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable accounting standards Incurred Loss ). 

The Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for debt securities for which other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized prior to January 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any other-than-temporarily impaired investment securities. Therefore, upon adoption of ASC 326, the Company determined that an allowance for credit losses on available for sale securities was not deemed necessary. 

The Company elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable and instead elected to reverse interest income on loans or securities that are placed on nonaccrual status, which is generally when the instrument is 90 days past due, or earlier if the Company believes the collection of interest is doubtful. The Company has concluded that this policy results in the timely reversal of uncollectible interest. 

The allowance for credit losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the loan balance, or a portion thereof, is uncollectable. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. 

The allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions, which includes forecasted future economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. 

The adoption of ASC 326 eliminated the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors and enhanced the disclosure requirements for loan refinancings and restructurings made with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. For information related to modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty after the adoption of ASC 326 and information regarding troubled debt restructurings before the adoption of ASC 326, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 

thousand and thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively and was reported in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using methods that approximate a level yield without anticipating prepayments. 

The accrual of interest is generally discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due and is not well collateralized and in the process of collection, or when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the principal or interest will not be collectible in the normal course of business. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. A loan is considered to be past due when a scheduled payment has not been received 30 days after the contractual due date. 

All accrued interest is reversed against interest income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interest received on such loans is accounted for using the cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, there is a sustained period of repayment performance, and future payments are reasonably assured. 

Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans 

Upon adoption of ASC 326, loans that were designated as Purchased Credit Impaired loans under the previous accounting guidance were classified as PCD loans without reassessment. 

In future acquisitions, the Company may purchase loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. In those cases, the Company will consider internal loan grades, delinquency status and other relevant factors in assessing whether purchased loans are PCD. PCD loans are recorded at the amount paid. An initial allowance for credit loss is determined using the same methodology as other loans held for investment, but with no impact to earnings. The initial allowance for credit loss determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan's purchase price and allowance for credit loss becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent to initial recognition, PCD loans are subject to the same interest income recognition and impairment model as non-PCD loans, with changes to the allowance for credit loss recorded through provision expense. 

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans, continued 

Commercial mortgage loans are secured by commercial purpose real estate, including both owner occupied properties and investment properties, for various purposes such as hotels, retail facilities, and office space. Operations of the individual projects as well as global cash flows of the debtors are the primary sources of repayment for these loans. The condition of the local economy is an important indicator of risk, but there are also more specific risks depending on the collateral type as well as the business. 

Commercial agricultural loans are made to operating companies, manufacturers, or farmers for the purpose of production, operating capacity, accounts receivable, inventory or equipment financing. Cash flow from the operations of the borrower is the primary source of repayment for these loans. The condition of the local economy is an important indicator of risk, but there are also more specific risks depending on the industry of the borrower. Collateral for these types of loans often do not have sufficient value in a distressed or liquidation scenario to satisfy the outstanding debt. 

Consumer and other loans are made to individuals and may be either secured by assets other than 1-4 family residences or unsecured. This segment includes auto loans and unsecured loans and lines. The primary source of repayment for these loans is the income and assets of the borrower. The condition of the local economy, in particular the unemployment rate, is an important indicator of risk for this segment. The value of the collateral, if there is any, is less likely to be a source of repayment due to less certain collateral values. Also included in this category is loans made to local and state municipalities for various purposes including refinancing existing obligations, infrastructure up-fit and expansion, or to purchase new equipment. These loans may be secured by general obligations from the municipal authority or revenues generated by infrastructure and equipment financed by the Company. The primary repayment source for these loans include the tax base of the municipality, specific revenue streams related to the infrastructure financed, and other business operations of the municipal authority. The health and stability of state and local economies directly impacts each municipality s tax basis and are important indicators of risk for this segment. The ability of each municipality to increase taxes and fees to offset debt service requirements give this type of loan a very low risk profile in the continuum of the Company s loan portfolio. 

Additionally, the allowance for credit losses calculation includes subjective adjustments for qualitative risk factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical experience. These qualitative adjustments may increase or reduce reserve levels and include adjustments for lending management experience and risk tolerance, loan review and audit results, asset quality and portfolio trends, loan portfolio growth, industry concentrations, trends in underlying collateral, external factors and economic conditions not already captured. The Company has designated 5-year treasury yield, federal funds rates, and national unemployment as its forecast variables for a period of 12 months. These forecasts from reputable and independent third parties are sourced to inform the Company s reasonable and supportable forecasting of current expected credit losses. 

Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. When management determines that foreclosure is probable and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the expected credit losses are based on the fair value of collateral at the reporting date unadjusted for selling costs as appropriate. 

Allowance for Credit Losses Unfunded Commitments 

Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit issued to meet customer financing needs. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for off-balance sheet loan commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. 

The Company records an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, unless the commitments to extend credit are unconditionally cancelable, through a charge to provision for credit losses in the Company s income statements. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated by loan segment at each balance sheet date under the current expected credit loss model using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur as well as any third-party guarantees. The allowance for unfunded commitments is included in other liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheets.

million and million, respectively. Fees for these services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to thousand and thousand, respectively. 

Mortgage Origination Fees Mortgage origination fees consist of commissions received on mortgage loans closed in the secondary market. The Company acts as an intermediary between the Company s customer and companies that specialize in mortgage lending in the secondary market. The Company s performance obligation is generally satisfied when the mortgage loan is closed and funded and the Company receives its commission at that time. Fees for these services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to thousand and thousand, respectively. Fees for these services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to thousand and thousand, respectively. 

Other Service Charges and Fees - Other service charges include safety deposit box rental fees, check ordering charges, and other service charges. Safe deposit box rental fees are charged to the customer on an annual basis and recognized upon receipt of payment. The Company determined that since rentals and renewals occur fairly consistently over time, revenue is recognized on a basis consistent with the duration of the performance obligation. Check ordering charges are transactional based, and therefore, the Company s performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time. In addition, the following items are also included in other service charges and fees on the consolidated statements of income: 

ATM, Credit and Debit Card Fees - ATM fees are primarily generated when a Company cardholder uses a non-Company ATM or a non-Company cardholder uses a Company ATM. Credit and debit card fees are primarily comprised of interchange fee income and merchant services income. Interchange fees are earned whenever the Company s debit and credit cards are processed through card payment networks such as Visa or Mastercard. Merchant services income mainly represents fees charged to merchants to process their debit and credit card transactions, in addition to account management fees. The Company s performance obligation for ATM fees, interchange fee income, and merchant services income are largely satisfied, and related revenue recognized, when the services are rendered or upon completion. Payment is typically received immediately or in the following month. Fees for these services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to million and million, respectively. Fees for these services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to thousand and thousand, respectively. 

Insurance and Investment - Insurance income primarily consists of commissions received on insurance product sales. The Company acts as an intermediary between the Company s customer and the insurance carrier. The Company s performance obligation is generally satisfied upon the issuance of the insurance policy. Shortly after the insurance policy is issued, the carrier remits the commission payment to the Company, and the Company recognizes the revenue. Investment income consists of recurring revenue streams such as commissions from sales of mutual funds and other investments. Commissions from the sale of mutual funds and other investments are recognized on trade date, which is when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation. The Company also receives periodic service fees (i.e., trailers) from mutual fund companies typically based on a percentage of net asset value.

million. The Company calculated fair values of all assets and liabilities acquired in the transaction. The assets and liabilities of JCB have been recorded at their estimated fair values and added to those of the Company for periods following the merger date. Valuations of acquired JCB assets and liabilities may be refined for up to one year following the merger date. The Company does not expect that any portion of goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes. 

The following table presents the JCB assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of September 1, 2024 as well as the related fair value adjustments and determination of goodwill.

The Management made significant estimates and exercised significant judgement in accounting for the acquisition of JCB. The following is a brief description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of major categories of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 

Investment Securities Available for Sale 

The estimated fair value of the acquired portfolio of debt securities was based on quoted market prices. All of the acquired portfolio was sold upon completion of the acquisition. 

Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The fair valuation process identified loans with credit risk indicators that qualified for purchase credit deteriorated PCD status. PCD and non-PCD loans were then evaluated for credit risk and other fair value indicators. Consistent with GAAP, JCB s related allowance for credit losses on loans was not recorded. Upon the acquisition of JCB, the Company reclassed thousand out of the fair value discount on PCD loans to the allowance for credit losses. 

Credit risk was quantified using a probability of default PD )/loss given default( LGD methodology from a market participant perspective and applied to each loan s outstanding principal balance. PD rates were applied based on FDIC call report code and risk rating category. LGD rates were applied based on FDIC call report code. Other fair value indicators were quantified using a discounted cash flow methodology, utilizing a built-up discount rate that contemplates current index rates adjusted for market assumed premiums. Cash flows were generated based upon the loans underlying characteristics and estimated prepayment speeds. 

The following table provides information on PCD and non-PCD loans as of the Acquisition Date:

Fair value 

Property and Equipment 

The fair value of premises acquired was based on recent third-party appraisals. Acquired equipment was based on the remaining net book value of JCB, which approximated fair value. 

Intangible Assets 

Core deposit relationships provide a stable source of funds for lending and contribute to profitability. The core deposit intangible was valued using an income approach focused on cost savings, which recognizes the cost savings represented by the expense of maintaining the core deposit base versus the cost of an alternative funding source. The valuation incorporates assumptions related to account retention, discount rates, deposit interest rates, deposit maintenance costs and alternative funding rates. 

Deferred Tax Asset 

Application of the fair value measurements resulted in an increase to the deferred tax asset. The deferred tax assets were calculated using a blended tax rate of 22.20 . 

Other Assets 

The fair value adjustment of other assets was based on the Company s evaluation of acquired other assets. 

Deposits 

Deposits were valued using methods appropriate to their characteristics. The fair value of noninterest bearing demand deposits, interest bearing demand deposits, money market and savings deposit accounts were assumed to approximate the carrying value as these accounts have no stated maturity and are payable on demand. Time deposits were valued at the present value of the expected contractual payments discounted at market rates for instruments with similar terms. 

Borrowings 

The estimated fair value of borrowings was determined by obtaining payoff quotes from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The borrowings were paid off upon completion of the acquisition. 

Other Liabilities 

The fair value adjustment of other liabilities was based on the Company s evaluation of acquired other liabilities.

At September 30, 2024, investment securities with unrealized losses had depreciated percent from their total amortized cost basis. Management evaluates all available for sale investments in an unrealized loss position on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation. If the Company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security, the security is written down to fair value and the entire loss is recorded in earnings. 

If either of the above criteria is not met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is the result of credit losses or other factors. In making the assessment, the Company may consider various factors including the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, performance on any underlying collateral, downgrades in the ratings of the security by a rating agency, the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments and adverse conditions specifically related to the security. If the assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security and any excess is recorded as an allowance for credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any amount of unrealized loss that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. 

Changes in the allowance for credit loss are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance for credit loss when management believes an available for sale security is confirmed to be uncollectible or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no allowance for credit losses related to the available for sale portfolio. 

Proceeds from the sales of investment securities available for sale were million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024.

Gains and losses on the sale of investment securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method. The realized loss shown below for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 resulted from the recognition of unamortized premiums on a called bond that had no pre-set call date. Gross realized gains and losses for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: 

Realized losses 

There were no securities transferred between the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios or other sales of held to maturity securities during the periods presented.

Credit Quality Indicators 

Management closely monitors the quality of the loan portfolio and has established a loan review process designed to help grade the quality of the Bank s loan portfolio. The Bank s loan ratings coincide with the Substandard, Doubtful and Loss classifications used by federal regulators in their examination of financial institutions. Generally, an asset is considered Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured financial institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in assets classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as "Loss are those considered uncollectible, and of such little value that its continuance on the books is not warranted. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Bank had no loans graded Doubtful or Loss included in the balance of total loans outstanding. 

Assets that do not currently expose the insured financial institutions to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but otherwise possess weaknesses are designated Special Mention. Management also maintains a listing of loans designated Watch . These loans represent borrowers with declining earnings, strained cash flow, increasing leverage and/or weakening market fundamentals that indicate above average risk. Loans that are currently performing and are of high quality are given a loan rating of Pass . 

Loans are graded at origination and will be considered for potential downgrades as the borrower experiences financial difficulties. Loan officers meet periodically to discuss their past due credits and loan downgrades could occur at that time. Commercial loans of over 1.0 million are reviewed on an annual basis, and that review could result in downgrades or in some cases, upgrades. In addition, the Company engages a third-party loan review each quarter. The results of these loan reviews could result in upgrades or downgrades.

Collateral Dependent Loans 

Loans that do not share risk characteristics within their respective loan pools are individually evaluated. The Company has certain loans for which repayment is dependent upon the operation or sale of collateral, as the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The underlying collateral can vary based upon the type of loan. The following provides more detail about the types of collateral that secure collateral dependent loans: 

Construction and development loans include both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans are typically secured by first liens on raw land acquired for the construction of owner occupied commercial real estate or non-owner occupied commercial real estate. Consumer loans are typically secured by a first lien on raw land acquired for the construction of residential homes for which a binding sales contract exists. 

Commercial real estate loans can be secured by either owner occupied commercial real estate or non-owner occupied investment commercial real estate. Typically, owner occupied commercial real estate loans are secured by office buildings, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and other commercial and industrial properties occupied by operating companies. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans are generally secured by office buildings and complexes, retail facilities, multifamily complexes, land under development, industrial properties, as well as other commercial or industrial real estate. 

Residential real estate loans are typically secured by first mortgages, and in some cases could be secured by a second mortgage. 

Home equity lines of credit are generally secured by second mortgages on residential real estate property. 

Consumer loans are generally secured by automobiles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and other personal property. Some consumer loans are unsecured and have no underlying collateral.

Modifications Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company uses a lifetime probability of default/loss given default model to determine the allowance for credit losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. There are no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies loans by providing principal forgiveness on certain of its real estate loans. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. 

In some cases, the Company will modify a certain loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. For the real estate loans included in the combination columns below, multiple types of modifications have been made on the same loan within the current reporting period. The combination is at least two of the following: a term extension, principal forgiveness, and interest rate reduction. 

There were no loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The following table shows the amortized cost basis of loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and for the three months ended September 30, 2023, disaggregated by class of loans and type of concession granted and describes the financial effect of the modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty: 

Added an average of 11.92 years to the life of the loan, which resulted in reduced payment. 

Total 

Reduced average interest rate from 8.75 to 5.75 . Added 3.86 years to the life of the loan, which resulted in reduced payment.

Consumer agricultural 

Reduced average interest rate from 9.50 to 7.00 . Added 0.61 years to the life of the loan. 

Total 

Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. There were no loans that had a payment default during the period and were modified in the 12 months before default to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 

The Company closely monitors the performance of the loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. The following table depicts the performance of loans that have been modified in the last 12 months as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

Unfunded Commitments 

The Company maintains a separate reserve for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The reserve for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit losses in the income statement. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, utilizing the same models and approaches for the Company's other loan portfolio segments described above, as these unfunded commitments share similar risk characteristics as its loan portfolio segments. The Company has identified the unfunded portion of certain lines of credit as unconditionally cancellable credit exposures, meaning the Company can cancel the unfunded commitment at any time. No credit loss estimate is reported for off-balance-sheet credit exposures that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company or for undrawn amounts under such arrangements that may be drawn prior to the cancellation of the arrangement. 

The following table presents the balance and activity in the allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

In August 2023, the Company executed a sale leaseback transaction on a branch location which resulted in a gain of thousand, and as a result, entered into a two year operating lease agreement and recognized a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the transaction. 

Lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease payments and are presented at each reporting date as the net present value of the remaining contractual cash flows. Cash flows are discounted at the Company s incremental borrowing rate in effect at the commencement date of the lease. For our incremental borrowing rate, we used the Federal Home Loan Bank rate available at the time of lease inception. The right-of-use assets represent the Company s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and are calculated as the sum of the lease liability and if applicable, prepaid rent, initial direct costs and any incentives received from the lessor. The contracts in which the Company is lessee are with parties external to the Company and not related parties. The Company s lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets and the lease liabilities are included in other liabilities. The following tables present information about leases:

Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the party. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties. 

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Collateral held varies as specified above and is required in instances which the Bank deems necessary. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Substantially all of the Bank s loans, commitments to extend credit, and standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Bank s market area and such customers are generally depositors of the Bank. Investments in state and municipal securities involve governmental entities within and outside the Bank s market area. The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 4. The distribution of commitments to extend credit approximates the distribution of loans outstanding. Standby letters of credit are granted primarily to commercial borrowers. The Bank s primary focus is toward small business and consumer transactions, and accordingly, it does not have a significant number of credits to any single borrower or group of related borrowers. The Bank has cash and cash equivalents on deposit with financial institutions which exceed federally insured limits.

The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Securities available for sale and derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans or foreclosed assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 

Fair Value Hierarchy 

Under FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , the Company groups assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: 

Level 1 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 

Level 2 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 

Level 3 Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques may include the use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 

Following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. 

Investment Securities Available for Sale 

Investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. Level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. Level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. Securities classified as Level 3 include asset-backed securities in less liquid markets. 

Individually Evaluated Loans 

Individually evaluated loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are evaluated for potential specific reserves and adjusted, if a shortfall exists, to fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral securing the loan if repayment is expected solely from the sale or operation of the collateral or present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the loan s contractual interest rate if the loan is not determined to be collateral dependent. All loans individually evaluated are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Fair value for individually evaluated loans is determined using several methods. Generally, the fair value of real estate is determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. These routine adjustments are made to adjust the value of a specific property relative to comparable properties for variations in qualities such as location, size, and income production capacity relative to the subject property of the appraisal. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

Other real estate owned is adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans, or former bank premises, to other real estate owned. Subsequently, other reals estate owned is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management s estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price the Company records the other real estate owned as nonrecurring Level 2. When the fair value of the collateral is based on either an external or internal appraisal and there is no observable market price, the Company records the other real estate owned as nonrecurring Level 3. As a result of the JCB merger, there was one property valued at thousand in other real estate owned at September 30, 2024 and there was no other real estate owned held as of December 31, 2023.

Assets Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These include assets and liabilities that are measured at the lower of cost or market that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. No liabilities were recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

On September 17, 2019 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation finalized a rule that introduces an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations (i.e., the community bank leverage ratio CBLR framework. The CBLR framework is designed to reduce burden by removing the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the framework. 

In order to qualify for the CBLR framework, a community banking organization must have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than , less than billion in total consolidated assets, and limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the CBLR framework and meets all requirements under the framework will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements under the prompt corrective action regulations and will not be required to report or calculated risk-based capital. 

The CBLR framework was available for banks to use in their September 30, 2024 Call Report. At this time the Company has elected not to opt into the CBLR framework for the Bank, but may opt into the CBLR framework in the future.

Executive Summary 

In connection with the acquisition of JCB, effective September 1, 2024, the Company acquired 154.1 million in assets at fair value, including 87.2 million in loans. The Company also assumed 133.8 million of liabilities at fair value, including 125.3 million of total deposits with a core deposit intangible asset recorded of 3.4 million, and goodwill of 4.6 million. 

Net income was 1.1 million, or 0.19 per share, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.1 million, or 0.37 per share, in the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 4.9 million, or 0.89 per share, compared to net income of 7.5 million, or 1.35 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net interest margin NIM was 3.78 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.72 in the second quarter of 2024, and 3.66 in the third quarter of 2023. 

Total assets increased 160.7 million, or 15.36 , to 1.21 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.05 billion at December 31, 2023. 

Net loans were 945.3 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 134.3 million, or 16.57 , when compared to 811.0 million at December 31, 2023. Excluding the 87.2 million in loans acquired as part of the JCB merger, loans increased by 48.1 million, or 5.90 , for the first nine months of 2024.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Results of Operations 

Results of Operations for the Three Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Net interest income after provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 was 9.2 million compared to 8.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Total interest income was 13.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 2.7 million, or 24.89 , in comparison to the third quarter of 2023. Interest income on loans increased in the quarterly comparison by 2.6 million, primarily due to organic loan growth of 87.7 million from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024, as well as interest rate increases during the same time period. Management anticipates that this loan growth, in addition to higher rates in the current year, will continue to have a positive impact on both earning assets and loan yields. Interest expense on deposits increased by 1.5 million in the quarterly comparison as a result of rate increases on deposit offerings, especially on time deposits due to deposit competition and a migration from lower cost deposits to time deposits. Management anticipates that interest expense on deposits will increase in the near term as competitive pressures for deposits may result in continued increases in rates on deposit offerings, especially on time deposits. Interest on borrowings increased by 24 thousand, primarily due to short-term FHLB advances to fund loan growth. 

Third quarter 2024 and 2023 noninterest income was comparable at 1.9 million for both quarters. Included in noninterest income for the third quarter of 2023 was 69 thousand related to life insurance income, and a gain of 197 thousand on the sale leaseback of a branch location was recorded in other income for the third quarter of 2023. Excluding these items, noninterest income increased by 200 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in service charges and fees of 80 thousand and an increase of 71 thousand in mortgage origination fees as mortgage origination volume increase compared to the year ago period. 

Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was 9.6 million compared with 7.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 1.7 million, or 21.80 . There was an increase in salary and benefit costs of 170 thousand due to personnel additions and routine salary adjustments, as well as increased benefit costs. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased 24 thousand and data processing increased by 138 thousand in the quarterly comparisons primarily due to branch expansion costs. Also included in noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was 1.1 million in merger related expenses related to the acquisition of Johnson County Bank. 

Net income before taxes decreased by 1.1 million in the quarterly comparison causing a decrease in income tax expense of 134 thousand. 

Results of Operations for the Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

For the first nine months of 2024, net interest income after provision for (recovery of) credit losses was 27.0 million compared to 26.7 million for the first nine months of 2023. Interest income increased by 6.5 million, primarily due to an increase of 6.4 million in interest income on loans. Interest expense on deposits increased by 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year. As previously discussed, this is a reflection of the increased competitive pressures for deposits. Interest on borrowings increased by 387 thousand in the nine-month comparison, due to short-term borrowings to help fund loan growth. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, noninterest income was comparable at 5.2 million for both periods. Included in noninterest income for the first nine months of 2024 was 221 thousand from life insurance contracts and a net realized security loss of 141 thousand. The net security loss resulted from the recognition of unamortized premiums on a called bond. Included in noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was income of 129 thousand related to loan hedge fees from a correspondent bank that was recorded in other income, the 197 thousand gain on the sale leaseback discussed above, 69 thousand from life insurance contracts and security losses of 16 thousand. Excluding these items noninterest income increased by 308 thousand for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily as a result on an increase in service charges and fees of 239 thousand and an increase of 20 thousand in mortgage origination fees.

Results of Operations for the Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, continued 

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, total noninterest expenses increased by 3.4 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to employee costs and branch costs associated with branch expansion discussed above. Salary and benefit cost increased by 577 thousand. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by 470 thousand, and data processing increased by 458 thousand from the first nine months of 2023 to 2024. Merger related expenses related to the acquisition of Johnson County Bank were 1.5 million for the first nine months of 2024. 

In the nine-month comparison, net income before taxes decreased by 3.1 million, resulting in a decrease in income tax expense of 459 thousand. 

Financial Condition 

In connection with the acquisition of JCB, effective September 1, 2024, the Company acquired 154.1 million in assets at fair value, including 87.2 million in loans. The Company also assumed 133.8 million of liabilities at fair value, including 125.3 million of total deposits with a core deposit intangible asset recorded of 3.4 million, and goodwill of 4.6 million. 

Total assets increased by 160.7 million, or 15.36 , to 1.21 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.05 billion at December 31, 2023. Total loans increased by 135.4 million, or 16.56 , to 953.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 817.7 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was due to the 87.2 million in loans acquired as part of the JCB merger, along with loan growth of 48.1 million during the first nine months of September 30, 2024. 

Asset quality has remained strong, with a ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans of 0.18 at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.21 at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses remained comparable at approximately 0.82 of total loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Investment securities decreased by 3.5 million to 123.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 127.4 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the first nine months of 2024 was the result of 2.7 million in called securities, 5.2 million in paydowns, and a decrease in unrealized losses of 4.4 million as a result of the decrease in interest rates during the first nine months of 2024. 

Total deposits increased in the first nine months of 2024 by 157.2 million, or 16.92 , to 1.09 billion September 30, 2024 from 928.7 million at December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the JCB merger. Excluding the 125.3 million of total deposits acquired as part of the JCB merger, total deposits increased by 31.8 million, or 3.43 , for the first nine months of 2024. Excluding the total deposits acquired in the JCB merger, noninterest bearing deposits increased by 2.4 million and interest-bearing deposits increased by 29.5 million during the first nine months of 2024. Excluding the total deposits acquired in the JCB merger, lower cost interest bearing deposits decreased by 2.9 million during the first nine months of 2024, and time deposits increased by 32.4 million, as customers continue to look for higher returns on their deposits. 

Total stockholders equity increased by 5.7 million, or 6.93 , to 88.6 million at September 30, 2024, from 82.9 million at December 31, 2023. The change during the first nine months of 2024 was due to earnings of 4.9 million, less dividends paid of 2.6 million, 3.4 million in other comprehensive income, and stock repurchases of 230 thousand. Book value increased from 14.84 per share at December 31, 2023 to 15.72 per share at September 30, 2024.

Nonperforming and Problem Assets 

Certain credit risks are inherent in making loans, particularly commercial and consumer loans. Management prudently assesses these risks and attempts to manage them effectively. The Bank attempts to use shorter-term loans and, although a portion of the loans have been made based upon the value of collateral, the underwriting decision is generally based on the cash flow of the borrower as the source of repayment rather than the value of the collateral. The Bank also attempts to reduce repayment risk by adhering to internal credit policies and procedures. These policies and procedures include officer and customer limits, periodic loan documentation review and follow up on exceptions to credit policies. 

Commercial real estate loans can be secured by either owner occupied commercial real estate or non-owner occupied investment commercial real estate. Typically, owner occupied commercial real estate loans are secured by office buildings, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and other commercial and industrial properties occupied by operating companies. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans are generally secured by office buildings and complexes, retail facilities, multifamily complexes, land under development, industrial properties, as well as other commercial or industrial real estate. As of September 30, 2024 approximately 49 of our commercial mortgage loans are owner occupied and 51 are non-owner occupied. The largest concentrations in commercial real estate as to type are office buildings, which includes medical offices, at approximately 23 , hotel properties at approximately 17 , warehouses at approximately 10 , and retail facilities at approximately 9 . 

The following table provides information about the allowance for credit losses, nonperforming assets and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Total nonperforming loans were 0.18 and 0.21 of total outstanding loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Loans are placed in nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Loans are removed from nonaccrual status when they are deemed a loss and charged to the allowance, transferred to foreclosed assets, or returned to accrual status based upon performance consistent with the original terms of the loan or a subsequent restructuring thereof. Management s ability to ultimately resolve these loans either with or without significant loss will be determined, to a great extent, by general economic and real estate market conditions. 

Past due loans are often regarded as a precursor to further credit problems which would lead to future increases in nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned. As of September 30, 2024, loans past due 30-89 days and still accruing totaled 789 thousand compared to 92 thousand at December 31, 2023.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Nonperforming and Problem Assets, continued 

Certain types of loans, such as option adjustable rate mortgage products, subprime loans and loans with initial teaser rates, can have a greater risk of non-collection than other loans. The Bank has not offered these types of loans in the past and does not offer them currently. Junior-lien mortgages can also be considered higher risk loans. Our junior-lien portfolio at September 30, 2024 totaled 4.2 million, or 0.44 of total loans. The charge-off rates in this category do not vary significantly from other real estate secured loans in the current year. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, we had loans with a current principal balance of 9.9 million and 3.5 million rated Watch or Special Mention . The Watch classification is utilized by us when we have an initial concern about the financial health of a borrower that indicate above average risk. We then gather current financial information about the borrower and evaluate our current risk in the credit. After this review we will either move the loan to a higher risk rating category or move it back to its original risk rating. Loans may be left rated Watch for a longer period of time if, in management s opinion, there are risks that cannot be fully evaluated without the passage of time, and we want to review it on a more regular basis. Assets that do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant a classification such as Substandard or Doubtful but otherwise possess weaknesses are designated Special Mention . Loans rated as Watch or Special Mention are not considered potential problem loans until they are determined by management to be classified as Substandard . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, potential problem loans classified as Substandard totaled 3.1 million and 4.1 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had no loans graded Doubtful included in the balance of total loans outstanding. 

The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb potential losses. Some of the factors which management considers in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses are: past loss experience, an evaluation of the current loan portfolio, identified loan problems, the loan volume outstanding, the present and expected economic conditions in general, and in particular, how such conditions relate to the market area that the Bank serves. Bank regulators also periodically review the Bank s loans and other assets to assess their quality. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance. Provisions for credit losses and recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance. The reserve for credit losses was approximately 0.82 of total loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The allocation of the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is the ability to convert assets to cash to fund depositors withdrawals or borrowers loans without significant loss. Unsecured federal fund lines available from correspondent banks totaled 73.0 million at September 30, 2024. The Bank had no balances outstanding on these lines as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. In addition, the Bank has the ability to borrow up to approximately 246.0 million from the FHLB, subject to the pledging of collateral. 

At September 30, 2024, the Bank had short-term FHLB advances of 20.0 million. At December 31, 2023, the Bank had short-term FHLB advances of 25.0 million and a 2.5 million borrowing from the Federal Reserve s Bank Term Funding Program that was classified as short-term. 

The Bank uses cash and federal funds sold to meet its daily funding needs. If funding needs are met through holdings of excess cash and federal funds, then profits might be sacrificed as higher-yielding investments are foregone in the interest of liquidity. Therefore, management determines, based on such items as loan demand and deposit activity, an appropriate level of cash and federal funds and seeks to maintain that level. 

The Bank s investment security portfolio also serves as a source of liquidity. The primary goals of the investment portfolio are liquidity management and maturity gap management. As investment securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested in federal funds sold if the federal funds level needs to be increased; otherwise, the proceeds are reinvested in similar investment securities. The majority of investment security transactions consist of replacing securities that have been called or matured. The Bank keeps a portion of its investment portfolio in unpledged assets with average lives or repricing terms of less than 60 months. These investments are a preferred source of funds because their market value is not as sensitive to changes in interest rates as investments with longer durations. 

On September 9, 2024, the Company entered into a 5.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit, with a maturity date of September 9, 2025. Interest on the line of credit is variable and is set at the prime rate. At September 30, 2024, 5.0 million was outstanding under this revolving line of credit at a rate of 8.00 and was classified as short-term debt. 

As a result of the steps described above, management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its customers credit needs. The liquidity ratio (the level of liquid assets divided by total deposits plus short-term liabilities) was 9.5 and 11.9 for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These ratios are considered to be adequate by management.

Part I. Financial Information 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Capital Resources 

A significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its capital base. Federal regulations have classified and defined capital into the following components: (1) Tier 1 capital, which includes common shareholders equity and qualifying preferred equity, and (2) Tier 2 capital, which includes a portion of the allowance for credit losses, certain qualifying long-term debt and preferred stock which does not qualify as Tier 1 capital. Financial institutions are also subject to the BASEL III requirements, which includes as part of the capital ratios profile the Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio. Minimum capital levels are regulated by risk-based capital adequacy guidelines, which require a financial institution to maintain capital as a percentage of its assets, and certain off-balance sheet items adjusted for predefined credit risk factors (risk-adjusted assets). 

Regulatory guidelines relating to capital adequacy provide minimum risk-based ratios at the Bank level which assess capital adequacy while encompassing all credit risks, including those related to off-balance sheet activities. At September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded minimum regulatory capital requirements and is considered to be well capitalized. 

At September 30, 2024, the Company s equity to asset ratio was 7.35 and the Bank s capital was in excess of regulatory requirements as discussed above. The Company will continue to monitor the residual effects of inflation in determining future cash dividends and any requirements for additional capital each quarter. The Company declared and paid dividends of 2.6 million, and had 230 thousand of stock repurchases, for the first nine months of 2024. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain information contained in this discussion may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934 as amended. These include statements as to expectations regarding future financial performance and any other statements regarding future results or expectations. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies, and expectations of the Company, are generally identified by the use of words such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," or "project" or similar expressions. Our ability to predict results, or the actual effect of future plans or strategies, is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries include, but are not limited to: changes in interest rates; general economic and financial market conditions; the effect of changes in banking, tax and other laws and regulations and interpretations or guidance thereunder; monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board; the quality, composition and fair value of the loan and securities portfolios; demand for loan products; deposit flows; liquidity and the availability of secondary funding sources; competition; demand for financial services in the Company s market area; the implementation of new technologies; the ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; accounting principles, policies, and guidelines; disruptions to customer and employee relationships and business operations caused by the acquisition of Johnson County Bank; the ability to implement integration plans associated with the acquisition, which integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; the ability to achieve the cost savings and synergies contemplated by the acquisition within the expected timeframe, or at all; and other factors identified in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the Company s Annual Report on 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We undertake no obligation to update or clarify these forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The Company s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1A. 

Risk Factors 

In connection with the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, the factors discussed under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 should be considered. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Combining the Bank and JCB may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, or could result in the loss of customers. 

The Bank and JCB companies have operated, and, until the completion of the acquisition, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to the Company s ability to: 

Timely and successfully integrate JCB into the Bank; 

Retain key employees of JCB, and retain and attract qualified personnel to the Company; and 

Maintain existing relationships with customers, suppliers and vendors of the Company and JCB. 

It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the Company s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. In addition, the success of the Company s acquisition of JCB will depend in part on its ability to realize the anticipated benefits and estimated cost savings from acquiring JCB, which may be more difficult to achieve than the Company anticipates and may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. 

The Company may have difficulty managing future growth and competition in Tennessee due to its previous limited operations in that market. 

The Company s primary market area is currently southwestern Virginia and western North Carolina. JCB s primary market is currently the Johnson County market in eastern Tennessee. After the acquisition is complete, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully compete in the eastern Tennessee market, or that it will be able to successfully manage additional growth in Tennessee. Because of the Company s limited participation in Tennessee prior to the acquisition of JCB, there may be unexpected challenges and difficulties that could adversely affect the Company s operations.
