 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR
THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 

 (In
U.S. dollars, except share and per share data) 

 (Unaudited) 

and net cash used in operations of ,
and as of September 30, 2024, the Company incurred an accumulated deficit of .
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date
that the financial statements are issued. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its
report on the Company s December 31, 2023 financial statements, has expressed substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the
Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its major shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to
meet the Company s obligations as they become due. Despite the amount of funds that we have raised in the past, no assurance can
be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to
the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations,
in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

(the Reverse Stock Split ),
effective as of July 28, 2022. On that date, every 10 issued and outstanding shares of the Company s Common Stock were automatically
converted into one outstanding share of Common Stock. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock decreased from (pre-split) shares to (post-split) shares. In addition, by reducing the number of outstanding
shares, the Company s loss per share in all prior periods increased by a factor of 10. The Reverse Stock Split affected all shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split. 

In
addition, the Reverse Stock Split effected a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants
outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, resulting in a reduction from (pre-split) shares
to (post-split) shares. On June 12, 2023 (the Expiration ), no warrants were exercised. Since the Expiration, all
warrants expired, no warrants are outstanding and exercisable (see Note 6). 

No
fractional shares are issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional
shares because they hold a number of pre-reverse stock split shares of the Company s Common Stock not evenly divisible by 10, in
lieu of a fractional share, are entitled the number of shares rounded up to the nearest whole share. The Company will issue one whole
share of the post-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock to any stockholder who otherwise would have received a fractional share as a result
of the Reverse Stock Split. 

The
Reverse Stock Split affected all holders of Common Stock uniformly and did not affect any stockholder s percentage of ownership
interest. The par value of the Company s Common Stock remained unchanged at per share and the number of authorized shares
of Common Stock remained the same after the Reverse Stock Split. 

As
the par value per share of the Company s Common Stock remained unchanged at per share, the change in the Common Stock recorded
at par value has been reclassified to additional paid-in-capital on a retroactive basis. All references to shares of Common Stock and
per share data for all periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been
adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split on a retroactive basis. 

Accounts
receivable at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are net of allowances for credit losses of and , respectively.
The following table provides a roll-forward of the allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of accounts
receivable to present the net amount expected to be collected at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Investments
in equity securities without readily determinable fair values of affiliates (related parties): 

Equity
securities without readily determinable fair values are investments without readily determinable market values. The Company adopted the
guidance of ASC 321, Investments - Equity Securities, which allows an entity to measure investments in equity securities without a readily
determinable fair value using a measurement alternative that measures these securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus
changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investment of same issuer (the Measurement
Alternative ). The fair value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values that have been remeasured due to impairment
are classified within Level 3. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis. Additionally, on a quarterly basis,
management is required to make a qualitative assessment of whether the investment is impaired. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not recognize any impairment or reversal of impairment. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized the reversal of impairment of 0 and , respectively
for one of its investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized impairment of for three of its total investments in equity securities
without readily determinable fair values and recorded a reversal of impairment of for one of its total investments in equity
securities without readily determinable fair values. 

In
addition, the Company recorded its equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost. For these cost method investments,
we recorded as other investments in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We reviewed all our cost method investments quarterly
to determine if impairment indicators were present; however, we were not required to determine fair value of these investments unless
impairment indicators exist. When impairment indicators exist, we generally adopt the valuation methods allowed under ASC820 Fair Value
Measurement to evaluate the fair values of our cost method investments approximated or exceeded their carrying values as of September
30, 2024. Our cost method investments had a carrying value of as of September 30, 2024.

Company
Overview 

Greenpro
Capital Corp. (the Company or Greenpro ), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 19, 2013. We provide
cross-border business solutions and accounting outsourcing services to small and medium-size businesses located in Asia, with an initial
focus on Hong Kong, China and Malaysia. Greenpro provides a range of services as a package solution (the Package Solution to our clients, and we believe that our clients can reduce their business costs and improve their revenues. 

In
addition to our business solution services, we also operate a venture capital business through Greenpro Venture Capital Limited, an Anguilla
corporation. One of our venture capital business segments focuses on (1) establishing a business incubator for start-up and high growth
companies to support such companies during critical growth periods, which will include education and support services, and (2) searching
the investment opportunities in selected start-up and high growth companies, which may generate significant returns to the Company. Our
venture capital business focuses on companies located in East and Southeast Asia, including Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, Thailand, and
Singapore. Another venture capital business segment focuses on rental activities of commercial properties and the sale of investment
properties. 

Results
of Operations 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we operated in three regions: Hong Kong, China and Malaysia. We derived
revenue from the provision of services and the rental activities of our commercial properties. 

Comparison
of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Total
revenue 

Total
revenue was 539,699 and 1,070,972 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decreased amount of 531,273
was primarily due to a decrease in business services revenue. We expect revenue from both business services and real estate business
segments to steadily improve in the following years. 

Business
services revenue 

Revenue
from the provision of business services was 521,765 and 1,043,360 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
It was derived principally from the provision of business consulting and advisory services as well as company secretarial, accounting,
and financial analysis services. We experienced a decrease in business services revenue as fewer listing service obligations were completed
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Real
estate business 

Rental
revenue 

Revenue
from rentals was 17,934 and 27,612 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. It was derived principally
from leasing properties in Hong Kong and Malaysia. The decrease of 9,678 in rental revenue was mainly due to the distribution of 40 of the real estate properties of our subsidiary, Forward
Win International Limited FWIL its noncontrolling interest (the NCI in consideration of our acquisition
of the remaining 40 shares of FWIL and settlement of a loan from the NCI in April 2024. As a result, fewer property units were available
for lease and lower rental revenue was generated. 

Sale
of real estate properties 

There
was no revenue generated from the sale of real estate properties for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

25 

Total
operating costs and expenses 

Total
operating costs and expenses were 1,012,972 and 1,207,517 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. They
consist of cost of business services revenue, cost of rental revenue, and general and administrative expenses. 

Loss
from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 473,273 and 136,545, respectively. An increase in loss from operations
was due to a decrease of revenue of 531,273, offset by a decrease of operating costs and expenses of 194,545 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024. 

Cost
of business services revenue 

Cost
of revenue from the provision of services was 138,404 and 219,865 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
It primarily consists of employee compensation and related payroll benefits, company formation costs, and other professional fees directly
attributable to costs related to the services rendered. 

The 
decrease in cost of business services revenue was mainly due to a decrease of other professional fees directly attributable to the
provision of services for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Cost
of rental revenue 

Cost
of rental revenue was 6,235 and 9,629 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. It includes the costs
associated with governmental charges, repairs and maintenance, property management fees and insurance, depreciation, and other related
administrative costs. Utility expenses are borne and paid by individual tenants directly. The decrease of cost of rental revenue was mainly due to 40 of FWIL s real estate properties being distributed to its NCI in April
2024. As a result, fewer property units were available for lease and lower costs were incurred. 

Cost
of real estate properties sold 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no real estate property was sold, and hence no cost was incurred. 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative G A expenses were 868,333 and 978,023 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and
2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, G A expenses primarily consisted of employees salaries
and allowances of 352,213, directors salaries and compensation of 167,032, advertising and promotion expenses of 75,133,
consulting fees of 4,166, computer and IT expenses of 49,949, legal service fees of 33,760, other professional fees of 59,704
and rent and rates of 28,598. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, G A expenses consisted primarily of
employees salaries and allowances of 319,523, directors salaries and compensation of 163,427, advertising and
promotion expenses of 45,104, computer and IT expenses of 101,624, consulting fees of 49,138, legal services fees of 48,936,
other professional fees of 60,563 and rent and rates of 27,965. The decreased G A expense of 109,690 was mainly derived from
the decrease of consulting fees from 49,138 to 4,166 and computer and IT expenses from 101,624 to 49,949 during the same period
from 2023 to 2024. We expect our G A expenses will continue to increase as we are developing our cryptocurrency exchange
businesses through our wholly owned subsidiary, Green-X Corp. and digital banking businesses through our newly acquired subsidiary,
Global Business Hub Limited in Labuan. 

Other
income 

Net
other income was 142,953 and 18,488 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, net other income mainly consisted of other income from gain on disposal of investment of 127,617 and interest income
of 3,979. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net other income consisted of interest income of 8,853 and other gains of 9,635. 

Net
loss 

Net
loss was 330,320 and 120,994 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net loss was mainly
due to a decrease in business services revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net
loss attributable to non-controlling interest 

The
Company recorded net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statements of operations for a non-controlling
interest (the NCI of a consolidated subsidiary, Forward Win International Limited FWIL ), which is principally
engaged in trading and leasing of properties in Hong Kong. 

The
Company had been a 60 shareholder of FWIL since inception. 

On
April 15, 2024, the Company acquired the remaining 40 shares of FWIL from the NCI by distribution of 40 of FWIL s real estate
properties for consideration of its acquisition and settlement of loan from the NCI (the Acquisition ). 

After
the Acquisition, FWIL becomes the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and hence no profit or loss was attributed to the NCI during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We
recorded a net loss attributable to the NCI of 3,865 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

26 

Comparison
of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

Total
revenue 

Total
revenue was 1,559,272 and 2,309,592 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 750,320
was primarily due to a decrease in business services revenue. We expect revenue from both business services and real estate business
segments to slightly decline in the following months as some tenancies are due to expire and some may not renew or may be renewed at lower rental rates because of the downturn in the
rental market in Hong Kong. 

Business
services revenue 

Revenue
from the provision of business services was 1,498,187 and 2,239,354 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
It was derived principally from business consulting and advisory services as well as company secretarial, accounting, and financial analysis
services. We experienced a decrease in business services revenue as fewer listing advisory services were rendered during the same period
in 2024. 

Real
estate business 

Rental
revenue 

Revenue
from rentals was 61,085 and 70,238 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. It was derived principally
from leasing properties in Hong Kong and Malaysia. The decrease of 9,153 in rental revenue was mainly due to the distribution of 40 of the real estate properties of our subsidiary, FWIL
to its NCI in consideration of our acquisition of the remaining 40 shares of FWIL and settlement of a loan from the NCI in April 2024.
As a result, fewer property units were available for lease and lower rental revenue was generated. 

Sale
of real estate properties 

There
was no revenue generated from the sale of real estate properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Total
operating costs and expenses 

Total
operating costs and expenses were 3,107,878 and 3,089,209 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. They
consist of cost of business services revenue, cost of rental revenue and G A expenses. The Company incurred 2,839,641 and 2,686,846
of G A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

Loss
from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 1,548,606 and 779,617, respectively. The increase in loss
from operations was mainly due to a decrease of business services revenue of 741,167 and an increase of G A expenses of 152,795
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Cost
of business services revenue 

Cost
of revenue from the provision of services was 249,112 and 374,048 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
It primarily consists of employee compensation and related payroll benefits, company formation costs, and other professional fees directly
attributable to costs related to the services rendered. 

The 
decrease in cost of business services revenue was mainly due to a decrease of other professional fees directly attributable to the
provision of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Cost
of rental revenue 

Cost
of rental revenue was 19,125 and 28,315 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. It includes the costs
associated with governmental charges, repairs and maintenance, property management fees and insurance, depreciation, and other related
administrative costs. Utility expenses are borne and paid directly by individual tenants. The decrease of cost of rental revenue was mainly due to 40 of FWIL s real estate properties being distributed to its NCI in April
2024. As a result, fewer property units were available for leasing and lower costs were incurred. 

Cost
of real estate properties sold 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no real estate property was sold, and hence no cost was incurred. 

General
and administrative expenses 

G A
expenses were 2,839,641 and 2,686,846 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, G A expenses consisted primarily of employees salaries and allowances of 1,042,998, directors 
salaries and compensation of 503,611, advertising and promotion expenses of 194,054, consulting fees of 118,839, computer and IT expenses
of 136,706, legal service fees of 119,176, other professional fees of 103,841, provision for credit losses of 90,243 and rent and
rates of 85,478. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, G A expenses consisted primarily of employees salaries and
allowances of 1,009,398, directors salaries and compensation of 489,589, advertising and promotion expenses of 149,404, computer
and IT expenses of 140,167, consulting fees of 122,349, legal services fees of 161,303, other professional fees of 123,595 and rent
and rates of 85,293. The increased G A expense of 152,795 was mainly derived from the increase of advertising and promotion expenses
from 149,404 to 194,054 and the increase of provision for credit losses of 91,328 during the same period from 2023 to 2024. We expect
our G A expenses will continue to increase as we are developing our cryptocurrency exchange businesses through our wholly owned subsidiary, Green-X Corp. and digital banking businesses
through our newly acquired subsidiary, Global Business Hub Limited in Labuan.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Use
of estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting estimates include certain
assumptions related to, among others, the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, impairment analysis of real estate assets and other
long-term assets including goodwill, valuation allowance on deferred income taxes, and the accrual of potential liabilities. Actual results
may differ from these estimates. 

30 

Revenue
recognition 

The
Company follows the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts . ASC 606 creates a five-step
model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts
or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction
price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance
obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect
the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients. 

The
Company s revenue consists of revenue from providing business consulting and corporate advisory services service revenue ),
revenue from the sale of real estate properties, and revenue from the rental of real estate properties. 

Impairment
of long-lived assets 

Long-lived
assets primarily include real estate held for investment, property and equipment, and intangible assets. In accordance with the provision
of ASC 360, the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation of its long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of each year,
or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate. The recoverability
of long-lived assets is measured at the reporting unit level. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less
than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the asset.
In addition, for real estate held for sale, an impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the
asset. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill
is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. Under the guidance of ASC 350, goodwill is not amortized, rather it is tested for impairment annually, and will be tested
for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit and would be measured as the excess carrying value of goodwill over the derived fair value of goodwill.
The Company s policy is to perform its annual impairment testing for its reporting units on December 31, of each fiscal year. 

Derivative
financial instruments 

Derivative
financial instruments consist of financial instruments that contain a notional amount and one or more underlying variables such as interest
rate, security price, variable conversion rate or other variables, require no initial net investment and permit net settlement. The derivative
financial instruments may be free-standing or embedded in other financial instruments. The Company evaluates its financial instruments
to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. The Company follows the provision
of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging for derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument
is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the
statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities
or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet
as current or non-current based on whether net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the
balance sheet date. At each reporting date, the Company reviews its convertible securities to determine that their classification is
appropriate.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
September 30, 2024, our cash balance was 1,027,513, as compared to 2,223,197 on December 31, 2023, a decrease of 1,195,684. We estimate
we still have sufficient cash available to meet our anticipated working capital for the next twelve months. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Company incurred a
net loss of 1,168,983 and net cash used in operations of 1,191,874, and as of September 30, 2024, the Company incurred an accumulated
deficit of 37,707,535. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting
firm, in its report on the Company s December 31, 2023 financial statements, has expressed substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company
is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its major shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to
meet the Company s obligations as they become due. 

Despite
the amount of funds that the Company has raised in the past, no assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be
available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional
financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution
for its shareholders, in the case of equity financing. 

Operating

cash used in operating activities was 1,191,874 and 1,293,574 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

of non-cash income from gain on disposal of investments of 324,917, offset by non-cash expenses from provision for credit losses of
 90,243 and depreciation and amortization of 185,016. 

The
net cash used in operating activities in 2023 primarily consisted of an increase in net accounts receivable of 235,409, a decrease in

of other investment of 6,882,000 and reversal of write-off notes receivable of 400,000, respectively.

Net
cash provided by investing activities was 333,265 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while net cash used in investing activities

Cybersecurity 

Risk
management and strategy 

We
recognize the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information
systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. 

Managing
Material Risks Integrated Overall Risk Management 

We
have strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture
of cybersecurity risk management. This integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making
processes at every level. Our management team continuously evaluates and addresses cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business
objectives and operational needs. 

Oversee
third-party risk 

Because
we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, we have implemented stringent processes to oversee and manage
these risks. We conduct thorough security assessments of all third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing monitoring to
ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards. The monitoring includes annual assessments of the SOC reports of our providers and
implementing complementary controls. This approach is designed to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents
originating from third-parties. 

Risks
from cybersecurity threats 

We
have not encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

As
a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company is not required
to provide the information under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended Exchange Act ). Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time period specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms, and to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including each of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, intends that our disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, our
management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent
all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because
of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two
or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due
to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
