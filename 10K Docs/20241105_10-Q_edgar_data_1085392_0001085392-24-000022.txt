FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Puget Energy and PSE include the following cautionary statements in this Form 10-Q to make applicable and to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Puget Energy or PSE. This report includes forward-looking statements, which are statements of expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives and assumptions of future events or performance. Words or phrases such as anticipates, believes, continues, could, estimates, expects, future, intends, may, might, plans, potential, predicts, projects, should, will likely result, will continue or similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward-looking statements and may be included in discussion of, among other things, our anticipated operating or financial performance, business plans and prospects, planned capital expenditures and other future expectations. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and prospects, future performance expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, government regulation and financial results. 
 Forward-looking statements reflect current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed. There can be no assurance that Puget Energy s and PSE s expectations, beliefs or projections will be achieved or accomplished. 
 In addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report, some important risks that could cause actual results or outcomes for Puget Energy and PSE to differ materially from past results and those discussed in the forward-looking statements include: 
 
 Governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Washington Commission, that may affect our ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return, including but not limited to disallowance or delays in the recovery of capital investments and operating costs and discretion over allowed return on investment; 
 
 Changes in, adoption of and compliance with laws and regulations, including decisions and policies concerning the environment, climate change, greenhouse gas or other emissions or by-products of electric generation (including coal ash or other substances) or natural gas distribution and sales, natural resources, and fish and wildlife (including the Endangered Species Act) as well as the risk of litigation arising from such matters, whether involving public or private claimants or regulatory investigative or enforcement measures; 
 
 Changes in tax law, related regulations or differing interpretation, or enforcement of applicable law by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other taxing jurisdiction; and PSE's ability to recover costs in a timely manner arising from such changes; 
 Inability to realize deferred tax assets and use PTCs due to insufficient future taxable income; 
 
 Accidents or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, floods, landslides, fires and wildfires (either affecting or caused by PSE's facilities or infrastructure), extreme weather conditions and other acts of God, terrorism, asset-based or cyber-based attacks, pandemic or similar significant events, which can interrupt service and lead to lost revenue, cause temporary supply disruptions and/or price spikes in the cost of fuel and raw materials, impose extraordinary costs, and subject the Company to liability; 
 
 Commodity price risks associated with procuring natural gas and power in wholesale markets from creditworthy counterparties; 
 Wholesale market disruption, which may result in a deterioration of market liquidity, increase the risk of counterparty default, affect the regulatory and legislative process in unpredictable ways, negatively affect wholesale energy prices and/or impede PSE's ability to manage its energy portfolio risks and procure energy supply, affect the availability and access to capital and credit markets and/or impact delivery of energy to PSE from its suppliers; 
 Financial difficulties of other energy companies and related events, which may affect the regulatory and legislative process in unpredictable ways, adversely affect the availability of and access to capital and credit markets and/or impact delivery of energy to PSE from its suppliers; 
 The effect of wholesale market structures (including, but not limited to, regional market designs or transmission organizations) or other related federal initiatives; 
 PSE electric or natural gas distribution system failure, blackouts or large curtailments of transmission systems (whether PSE's or others'), or failure of the interstate natural gas pipeline delivering to PSE's system, all of which can affect PSE's ability to deliver power or natural gas to its customers and generating facilities; 
 Electric plant generation and transmission system outages, which can have an adverse impact on PSE's expenses with respect to repair costs, added costs to replace energy or higher costs associated with dispatching a more expensive generation resource; 
 The ability to restart generation following a regional transmission disruption; 
 The ability of a natural gas or electric plant to operate as intended; 
 PSE's resource adequacy needs to meet the Washington CETA and the Washington CCA requirements, through a combination of owned or contracted resources, may significantly increase purchased power and gas costs if pricing pressures and supply constraints on resource acquisitions increase; 
 
 Changes in climate, weather conditions, or sustained extreme weather events in PSE's operational territory, which could have effects on customer usage and PSE's revenue and expenses; 
 
 Regional or national weather conditions (including conditions and events associated with climate change), wildfires, droughts, earthquakes, and other natural disasters, which could impact PSE's ability to procure adequate supplies of natural gas, fuel or purchased power to serve its customers and the cost of procuring such supplies; 
 
 Variable hydrological conditions, which can impact streamflow and PSE's ability to generate electricity from hydroelectric facilities; 
 Variable wind conditions, which can impact PSE's ability to generate electricity from wind facilities; 
 The ability to renew contracts for electric and natural gas supply and the price of renewal; 
 Industrial, commercial and residential growth and demographic patterns in the service territories of PSE; 
 General economic conditions in PSE's operational territory, such as inflation, which may impact customer consumption or affect PSE's accounts receivable; 
 
 The loss of significant customers, changes in the business of significant customers or the condemnation of PSE's facilities as a result of municipalization or other government action or negotiated settlement, which may result in changes in demand for PSE's services; 
 The failure of information systems or the failure to secure information system data, which may impact the operations and cost of PSE's customer service, generation, distribution and transmission; 
 Opposition and social activism that may hinder PSE's ability to perform work or construct infrastructure; 
 Capital market conditions, including changes in the availability of capital and interest rate fluctuations; 
 General economic and political conditions, such as the effects of geopolitical tensions related to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts, recessions, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, corruption, political instability, acts of war, and local and national elections; 
 
 Employee workforce factors including strikes; work stoppages; retirements; absences due to pandemics, accidents, natural disasters or other significant, unforeseeable events; availability of qualified employees or the loss of a key executive; 
 PSE's service territory operates within a region of high demand for skilled workers resulting in significant competition and inflated wages, which puts pressure on PSE's ability to attract, retain and compensate employees; 
 The ability to obtain insurance coverage, the availability of insurance for certain specific losses, including those arising from catastrophic events such as wildfires and the cost of such insurance; 
 Changes in Puget Energy's or PSE's credit ratings, which may have an adverse impact on the availability and cost of capital for Puget Energy or PSE generally; 
 Deteriorating values of the equity, fixed income and other markets which could significantly impact the value of investments of PSE's retirement plan, post-retirement medical benefit plan trusts and the funding of obligations thereunder; and 
 
 Recent laws enacted, amended or proposed in Washington and other municipalities in PSE's service territory, may impact PSE s operations by, among others: changing system planning; changing existing statutory targets; instituting electrification requirements; or establishing Washington Commission requirements. 

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and, except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of any such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.

Therefore, capital and operating costs that are incurred by PSE and allocated to Puget LNG are related party transactions by nature. 
 In 2009, Puget Holdings, owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors, completed its merger with Puget Energy (the merger). As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings. The acquisition of Puget Energy was accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), as of the date of the merger. ASC 805 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the merger date. 
 The consolidated financial statements of Puget Energy reflect the accounts of Puget Energy and its subsidiaries. PSE s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PSE and its subsidiary. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company . The consolidated financial statements are presented after elimination of all significant intercompany items and transactions. PSE s consolidated financial statements continue to be accounted for on a historical basis and do not include any ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805) purchase accounting adjustments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The Company measures expected credit losses on trade receivables on a collective basis by receivable type, which include electric retail receivables, natural gas retail receivables, and electric wholesale receivables. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.

 Tacoma LNG Facility 
 In February 2022, the Tacoma LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma completed commissioning and commenced commercial operations. In December 2019, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA) issued the air quality permit for the facility, and the Pollution Hearings Control Board of Washington State upheld the approval following extended litigation. The Tacoma LNG facility provides peak-shaving services to PSE s natural gas customers, and provides LNG as fuel to transportation customers, particularly in the marine market at a lower cost due to the facility's scale. The State of Washington Division II Court of Appeals upheld the permit issuance and in February 2024 denied the Puyallup Tribe of Indians' motion to reconsider. On March 22, 2024, a coalition of environmental organizations led by Advocates for a Cleaner Tacoma, petitioned the Washington Supreme Court to review portions of the Court of Appeals' decision and on March 25, 2024, the Puyallup Tribe of

of common capital and operating costs, consistent with the regulated portion of the Tacoma LNG facility. The remaining of common capital and operating costs of the Tacoma LNG facility will be allocated to Puget LNG. Per this allocation of costs, million and million of non-utility plant operating cost is reported in the Puget Energy "Other property and investments" line item as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Additionally, million and million of operating costs are reported in the Puget Energy "Non-utility expense and other" financial statement line item for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Further, million and million of natural gas plant related to PSE s portion of the Tacoma LNG facility is reported in the PSE Utility plant - Natural gas plant financial statement line item as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as PSE is a regulated entity. 
 
 Variable Interest Entities 
 In April 2017, PSE entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Skookumchuck Wind Energy Project, LLC (Skookumchuck) pursuant to which Skookumchuck would develop a wind generation facility and sell bundled energy and associated attributes, namely renewable energy certificates (RECs), to PSE over a term of years. Skookumchuck commenced commercial operation in November 2020. In May 2020, PSE entered into a PPA with Golden Hills Wind Farm, LLC (Golden Hills) pursuant to which Golden Hills would develop a wind generation facility and sell bundled energy and associated attributes, namely RECs, to PSE over a term of years. On April 29, 2022, Golden Hills commenced commercial operations. In February 2021, PSE entered into a PPA with Clearwater Wind Project, LLC (Clearwater) in which Clearwater would develop a wind generation facility and sell energy and associated attributes to PSE over a term of years. On November 8, 2022, Clearwater commenced commercial operations. For each of the aforementioned PPAs, PSE has equity investment in the generation facilities, but is the only customer of each facility. PSE has concluded that Skookumchuck, Golden Hills, and Clearwater represent variable interest entities (VIE) and that PSE is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since it does not control the commercial and operating activities of the facilities. Additionally, PSE does not have the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits. As a result, PSE does not consolidate the VIEs. 
 Purchased energy of million and million were recognized in purchased electricity on the Company's consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Additionally, million and million were included in accounts payable on the Company's balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations 
 In December 2020, Puget LNG entered into a contract with one customer where Puget LNG is selling LNG over a -year delivery period which began April 1, 2024. The contract requires the customer to purchase a minimum annual quantity even if the customer does not take delivery. The price of the LNG includes a fixed charge, a fuel charge that includes both a market index and fixed margin component and other variable consideration. The fixed transaction price is allocated to the remaining performance obligations which is determined by the fixed charge components multiplied by the outstanding minimum annual quantity.

 . PSE's hedging strategy includes a risk-responsive component for the core natural gas portfolio, which utilizes quantitative risk-based measures with defined objectives to balance both portfolio risk and hedge costs. 
 PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools. In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options. Currently, the Company does not apply cash flow hedge accounting and therefore records all mark-to-market gains or losses through earnings. 
 The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varied maturities. The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs. The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.

Natural gas derivatives (MMBtus) 3 
 Total derivative contracts Current Long-term Total derivative contracts 
 3 All fair value adjustments on derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations, due to the PGA mechanism. The net derivative asset or liability and offsetting regulatory liability or asset are related to contracts used to economically hedge the cost of physical gas purchased to serve natural gas customers. 
 Electric portfolio derivatives consist of electric generation fuel of million MMBtu and purchased electricity of million MWhs at September 30, 2024, and million MMBtus and million MWhs at December 31, 2023. 
 
 It is the Company's policy to record all derivative transactions on a gross basis at the contract level without offsetting assets or liabilities. The Company generally enters into transactions using the following master agreements: WSPP agreements, which standardize physical power contracts; ISDA agreements, which standardize financial natural gas and electric contracts; and NAESB agreements, which standardize physical natural gas contracts. The Company believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as the right of set-off in the event of counterparty default. The set-off provision can be used as a final settlement of accounts which extinguishes the mutual debts owed between the parties in exchange for a new net amount. For further details regarding the fair value of derivative instruments, see Note 5, "Fair Value Measurements," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report.

 The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve its customers. Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty's non-performance under an agreement. The Company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty credit analysis, exposure measurement, and exposure monitoring and mitigation. 
 The Company monitors counterparties for significant swings in credit default swap rates, credit rating changes by external rating agencies, ownership changes or financial distress. Where deemed appropriate, the Company may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate potential credit default losses. Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure. 
 It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposure with one or more counterparties. If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could suffer a material financial loss. However, as of September 30, 2024, approximately of the Company's energy portfolio exposure, excluding NPNS transactions, is with counterparties that are rated investment grade by rating agencies and are either rated below investment grade or not rated by rating agencies. The Company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated by the major rating agencies. 
 The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty. The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors in the determination of reserves, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads. The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty's risk of default. The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor's and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate. The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted average default tenor for that counterparty's deals. The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty to derive an average value. The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.

Unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments in the Company's consolidated statements of income. 
 The Company does not use internally developed models to make adjustments to significant unobservable pricing inputs. The only significant unobservable input into the fair value measurement of the Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities is the forward price for electric and natural gas contracts. The weighted average price is calculated as the total market value divided by the total volume of the Company's Level 3 electric and natural gas commodity contracts, respectively, as of the reporting date.

 The significant unobservable inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted. Consequently, significant increases or decreases in the forward prices of electricity or natural gas in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities. Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power. As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a hypothetical increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company's derivative portfolio, classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, by million and million, respectively. 
 
 Long-Lived Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 Puget Energy records the fair value of its intangible assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, (ASC 360). The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating non-performance risk. Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation. The fair value of the power contracts is amortized as the contracts settle. 
 ASC 360 requires long-lived assets to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. One such triggering event is a significant decrease in the forward market prices of power. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Puget Energy completed valuation and impairment testing of its power purchase contracts classified as intangible assets and determined that impairment was needed. These intangible assets exist as a result of the merger in 2009, at which time the consolidated assets and liabilities were revalued in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations."

and , respectively in rate year two (expected to approximate calendar year 2026). PSE requested a return on equity of for the first rate year beginning in 2025 and for the second rate year beginning in 2026. PSE requested an overall rate of return of in rate year one and in rate year two. The filing requests recovery of forecasted plant additions through 2024 as required by Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 80.28.425 as well as forecasted plant additions through 2026, the final year of the MYRP. The procedural calendar for the adjudication of the case is set, with evidentiary hearing occurring on November 4th and 5th of 2024. The Company estimates the approved rates from this proceeding will become effective by statute approximately 11 months after filings. On August 6, 2024, intervenor response testimony was filed with the Washington Commission, to which PSE filed rebuttal testimony on September 18, 2024. 
 On December 22, 2022, the Washington Commission issued an order on PSE s 2022 GRC, which was filed on January 31, 2022 that approved a weighted cost of capital of , or after-tax, a capital structure of in common equity in 2023 and 2024, and a return on equity of . On January 6, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s natural gas rates in its compliance filing with an overall net revenue change of million or in 2023 and million or in 2024, with an effective date of January 7, 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s electric rates in its compliance filing with an overall net revenue change of million or in 2023 and million or in 2024 with an effective date of January 11, 2023. Per the 2022 GRC Final Order in Docket No. UE-220066, power cost only rate case (PCORC) rates were set to as of January 11, 2023 and PSE agreed not to file a PCORC during 2023 and 2024, the period covered by the rate plan agreed to in the GRC settlement. Per the 2022 GRC Final Order in Docket No. UG-220067, PSE was authorized to seek recovery of the costs related to the Tacoma LNG Facility concurrent with its 2023 PGA filing. 
 On April 24, 2024, the Washington Commission issued Final Order 07 under Docket No. UG-230393. The order determined that PSE acted prudently in developing and constructing the Tacoma LNG Facility after the initial decision to build in September 2016. Further, there were two main outcomes that resulted from the order. First, the Washington Commission did not authorize recovery of the portion of the Company s deferred return on its investment in the Tacoma LNG Facility that was recorded between February 1, 2022, the date the facility was placed into service, and January 11, 2023, the date PSE s 2022 GRC rates went into effect. Second, the Washington Commission directed PSE to increase the allocation of distribution pipeline investment to Puget LNG. The Washington Commission determined that the allocation should be tied to the relative flow of natural gas across these facilities, resulting in a higher allocation to Puget LNG than was originally filed. On May 3, 2024, PSE made the compliance filing required by Final Order 07. On May 24, 2024, Public Counsel and the Puyallup Tribe of Indians each filed a petition for judicial review of the Washington Commission s Final Order 07. The petitions were filed in Thurston County Superior Court and are expected to be consolidated. Both petitions allege that the Washington Commission (i) failed to properly apply the updated public interest standard, (ii) failed to disallow all costs related to PSE s redesign of the pipeline and development of waste gas disposal methods, and (iii) failed to conduct an independent determination of reasonable attorney fees. 
 For further information, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the Company's Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Climate Commitment Act Deferral 
 On December 29, 2022, PSE filed accounting petitions with the Washington Commission requesting authorization to defer costs and revenues associated with the Company s compliance with the CCA codified in law within RCW 70A.65. On February 28, 2023, in Order 01 in Docket No. UE-220974 and UG-220975, the Washington Commission granted PSE approval to defer the cost of emission allowances to comply with the CCA and the proceeds from no-cost allowances consigned to auction beginning January 1, 2023. 
 On August 3, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for CCA rates in Docket No. UG-230470, subject to refund, effective October 1, 2023, to recover the estimated ongoing allowance costs and proportionate pass back of credits to customers from estimated auction proceeds during the period of August 2023 through December 2023. On October 26, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for CCA rates in Docket No. UG-230756, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2023, to recover the estimated ongoing allowance costs and proportionate pass back of credit to customers from estimated auction proceeds during the period of January 2023 through September 2023. 
 On November 22, 2023, PSE filed proposed revisions to its natural gas rates to incorporate allowance costs and auction proceeds in Docket UG-230968. In the filing PSE sought to update rates pertaining to amounts deferred from January 2023 through September 2023 and to add new language to the tariff that would enable PSE to fund decarbonization projects using a portion of the projected no cost allowances revenues. The request, as revised by PSE on December 19, 2023, represented a revenue increase of million. The Washington Commission suspended the tariff sheets but allowed the rates to go into 
 30 

million, which represents the amounts to date collected in customer natural gas rates for CCA obligation costs, net of the expense incurred for the purchase of allowances for electric and natural gas operations. Additionally, PSE will continue to consign for auction at least the minimum amount of no-cost emission allowances allocated for natural gas operations in compliance with the CCA, the proceeds of which will continue to be used for the benefit of natural gas customers, as determined by the Washington Commission. PSE does not record a regulatory liability to defer the proceeds until consigned allowances are sold at auction. As of September 30, 2024, PSE recorded a regulatory asset of million, which represents the proceeds from the sale of consigned natural gas GHG emission allowances passed back through customer rates, net of proceeds received from the sale of consigned allowances sold at auction. 
 
 Revenue Decoupling Adjustment Mechanism 
 PSE performed an analysis to determine if electric and natural gas decoupling revenue deferrals would be collected from customers within 24 months of the annual period, per ASC 980. If not, for GAAP purposes only, PSE would need to record a reserve against the decoupling revenue and corresponding regulatory asset balance. Once the reserve is probable of collection within 24 months from the end of the annual period, the reserve can be recognized as decoupling revenue. 
 Based on the analysis as of September 30, 2024, million and reserve adjustment was recorded to electric and natural gas decoupling revenue as of September 30, 2024, respectively. reserve adjustment was recorded for electric or natural gas decoupling revenue as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism 
 PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs. The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions. Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached. 
 Over or under collected between 17 million - 40 million 
 
 Over or under collected beyond 40 million 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in its PCA mechanism, PSE under recovered its allowable costs by million of which million was apportioned to customers and million of interest was accrued on the deferred customer balance. This compares to an over recovery of allowable costs of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which million was apportioned to customers and million of interest was accrued on the total deferred customer balance. 
 
 Power Cost Adjustment Clause 
 PSE exceeded the million cumulative deferral balance in its PCA mechanism in 2022. During 2022, actual power costs were higher than baseline power costs, thereby, creating an under-recovery of million. Under the terms of the PCA s sharing mechanism for under-recovered power costs, PSE absorbed million of the under-recovered amount, and customers were responsible for the remaining million, or million including interest and adjusted for revenue sensitive items. On April 28, 2023, PSE filed the 2022 PCA report in Docket No. UE-230313 that proposed a recovery of the deferred balance, which included a revenue requirement increase of in overall bill for all customers, with rates proposed to go into effect from December 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024. 
 On September 29, 2023, PSE filed its variable power cost rates update as part of the 2022 GRC Order requirement in Docket No. UE-220066. The filing was approved in part on December 22, 2023, with updated rates effective January 1, 2024. 
 31 

million cumulative deferral balance in its PCA mechanism in 2023. During 2023, actual power costs were lower than baseline power costs, thereby creating an over-recovery of million. Under the terms of the PCA s sharing mechanism for over-recovered costs, PSE s share of the over-recovery was million and customers were due the remaining million, or million including interest and adjusted for revenue sensitive items. 
 On April 30, 2024, PSE filed the 2023 PCA compliance report, in Docket No. 240288, that proposed to pass back 2023 deferred balances from October 1, 2024 to December 31, 2025, resulting in credits to customers of million. Additionally, PSE requested to recover the forecasted 2024 deferred balance of million from October 1, 2024 to December 31, 2025. On September 26, 2024, the Washington Commission approved the filing as proposed with rates going into effect October 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025. 
 
 Purchased Gas Adjustment Mechanism 
 In October 2022, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for PGA rates in Docket No. UG-220715, effective November 1, 2022. As part of that filing, PSE requested an annual revenue increase of million, where PGA rates, under Schedule 101, increase annual revenue by million, and the tracker rates under Schedule 106 increase annual revenue by million. 
 In November 2022, the FERC approved a settlement of a counterparty, FERC Docket No. RP17-346. Under the terms, PSE was allocated million related to PSE natural gas services, which was recorded on December 31, 2022 and included below. The 2022 GRC order required PSE to amortize the refund in 2023 as a credit against natural gas costs and therefore pass back the refund to customers through the PGA mechanism. 
 On October 26, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for PGA rates in Docket No. UG-230769, effective November 1, 2023. As part of that filing, PSE requested an annual revenue decrease of million, where PGA rates, under Schedule 101, decrease annual revenue by million, and the tracker rates, under Schedule 106, decrease annual revenue by million. The annual 2023 PGA rate decreases include the aforementioned counterparty settlement pass back of million under Supplemental Schedule 106B. 
 On October 24, 2024, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for PGA rates in Docket No. UG-240708, effective November 1, 2024. As part of that filing, PSE requested an annual overall revenue increase of million, where PGA rates, under Schedule 101, decrease annual revenue by million and the tracker rates, under Schedule 106, increase annual revenue by million. The revenue increase in Schedule 106 is primarily due to the cessation of the counterparty refund of million, mentioned above, that was amortized as a credit in 2023 and million in commodity deferrals that were passed back to customers. ) Actual natural gas costs Allowed PGA recovery ) ) Interest ) ) Refund/interest from counterparty settlement ) PGA (liability)/receivable ending balance ) )

million in weather-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs, of which the Company deferred million as regulatory assets related to storms that occurred in 2024. This compares to million incurred in weather-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which the Company deferred and million as regulatory assets related to storms that occurred in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Under the 2017 GRC Order, the storm loss deferral mechanism approved the following: (i) the cumulative annual cost threshold for deferral of storms under the mechanism at million; and (ii) qualifying events where the total qualifying cost is less than million will not qualify for deferral and these costs will also not count toward the million annual cost threshold.

 million for allowances for electric operations as of September 30, 2024. Given the potential for future rulemakings and the WDOE's ability to adjust no-cost allowances during the compliance period, there is estimation uncertainty surrounding the Company's ability to estimate its compliance obligation both on an annual basis and a four-year compliance period, prior to a final WDOE determination. 
 As existing uncertainties are resolved in future periods, any change in compliance costs as a result of such estimated additional liabilities would be deferred under ASC 980 as a regulatory asset consistent with Docket No. UE-220974, as these amounts will be recoverable from customers in future utility rates. As a result, there is no current impact to the Company's consolidated statements of income.

Overview 
 
 Puget Energy is an energy services holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company. PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution. Puget Energy's business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE. Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG), which has the sole purpose of owning and operating the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings). Puget Holdings is owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors including the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCIMC), the Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), Ontario Municipal Employee Retirement System (OMERS), PGGM Vermogensbeheer B.V., Macquarie Washington Clean Energy Investment, L.P., and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company. 
 PSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington. PSE continually balances its load requirements, generation resources, purchase power agreements, and market purchases to meet customer demand. The Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs. PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs. 
 
 36 

Factors and Trends Affecting PSE's Performance 
 PSE s ongoing regulatory requirements and operational needs necessitate the investment of substantial capital in 2024 and will continue to do so in future years. Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process. The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE s operations and financial performance include: 
 The rates PSE is allowed to charge for its services; 
 PSE s ability to recover power costs that are subject to the Company's power cost adjustment mechanism that are included in rates, which are based on volume; 
 Weather conditions, including the impact of temperature on customer load; the impact of extreme weather events on budgeted maintenance costs; and meteorological conditions such as snow-pack, stream-flow and wind-speed which affect power generation, supply and price; 
 The effects of climate change, including changes in the environment that may affect energy costs or consumption, increase the Company s costs, or adversely affect its operations; 
 Regulatory decisions allowing PSE to recover purchased power and fuel costs, on a timely basis; 
 PSE s ability to supply electricity and natural gas, either through company-owned generation, purchase power contracts or by procuring natural gas or electricity in wholesale markets; 
 Deferral of excess revenues if earnings exceed PSE's authorized rate of return (ROR) by more than 0.5 ; 
 Availability and access to capital and the cost of capital; 
 Regulatory compliance costs, including those related to new and developing federal regulations of electric system reliability, state regulations of natural gas pipelines and federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, such as the Washington CCA; 
 Wholesale commodity prices of electricity and natural gas; 
 Increasing capital expenditures with additional depreciation and amortization; 
 Failure to complete capital projects on schedule and within budget or the abandonment of capital projects, either of which could result in the Company s inability to recover project costs or refund previously collected revenues; 
 Changes in customer growth and customer usage; 
 Tax reform, the effect of lower tax rates, and regulatory treatment of excess deferred tax balances on rate base and customer rates; 
 General economic conditions, such as inflation, in PSE's operational territory and its effects on customer growth and use-per-customer; 
 Federal, state, and local taxes; 
 Employee workforce factors, including potential strikes, work stoppages, transitions in senior management, and loss or retirement of key personnel and availability of qualified personnel; 
 The effectiveness of PSE s risk management policies and procedures; 
 Cybersecurity incidents and/or attacks, data security breaches, or other malicious acts that cause damage to the Company s generation and transmission facilities or information technology systems, or result in the release of confidential customer, employee, or Company information; 
 Acts of war or terrorism locally or abroad, or the impact of civil unrest to infrastructure or preventing access to infrastructure and its impact on the supply chain and prices of goods and services; 
 Natural disasters such as wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, landslides, and windstorms, the rise in frequency and magnitude of extreme temperature events, and possible accidents, explosions, fires or mechanical breakdowns affecting or caused by PSE s facilities or infrastructure may increase the Company's costs, impact PSE's generation, transmission, and distribution systems, subject the Company to increased liability, and/or adversely affect its operations; 
 Risks due to health crises, such as epidemics and pandemics, including supply shortages, rising costs, disruption to vendor or customer relationships, the potential for reputational harm, the impact of government, business and company closure of facilities, customer or contract defaults; concerns of safety to employees and customers, potential costs due to quarantining of employees and work-from-home policies, and the Company's and vendor staffing levels resulting from vaccination mandates; and 
 Legislative, regulatory, code, and/or ordinance changes that impact operations, electric and natural gas availability, sales, transmission, delivery, and/or restrictions.

Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs 
 PSE's regulatory requirements, environmental compliance and operational needs require the investment of substantial capital in 2024 and future years. As PSE intends to seek recovery of these investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon outcomes from that process. The rates PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Commission. Prior to 2023, the Washington Commission required that rates be determined based on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions. Incremental customer growth and sales typically did not provide sufficient revenue to cover general cost increases due to regulatory lag and attrition. Therefore, the Company would seek rate relief through rate cases with the Washington Commission, which would determine whether the Company's expenses and capital investments were reasonable and prudent for the provision of cost-effective, reliable and safe electric and natural gas service. If the Washington Commission determined that a capital investment was not reasonable or prudent, the costs (including return on any resulting rate base) related to such capital investment would be disallowed, partially or entirely, and not recovered in rates. 
 In 2021, the Washington Governor signed legislation passed by the state legislature that requires investor-owned utilities to file a forward looking MYRP for two, three, or four years as part of a GRC filed with the Washington Commission on or after January 1, 2022. For the initial rate year, the legislation requires the Washington Commission to ascertain and determine the fair value for rate-making purposes of the property in service as of the date that rates go into effect. Under the law, while utilities are required to file a MYRP (at least two years in length) the Washington Commission is not required to approve them. To the extent the Washington Commission approves a MYRP, utilities are bound to the first and second year of the MYRP but may file for a new rate plan in years three or four. If a company earns greater than a half percent above its authorized rate of return on a regulated basis, revenues above that level must be deferred for refunds to customers or another determination by the Washington Commission in a subsequent adjudicative proceeding. The Washington Commission must also set performance measurements to assess a natural gas or electric company operating under a MYRP. 
 Washington State law also requires PSE to pursue electric conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible, and the Washington Decarbonization Act for Large Combination Utilities, introduced as house bill 1589, requires PSE to achieve two percent of electric load annually with conservation and energy efficiency resources unless the Washington Commission finds that a higher target is cost effective. The Washington Decarbonization Act for Large Combination Utilities was passed by the Washington State legislature in March 2024 and signed into law in April 2024. The law enables PSE, under the supervision of the Washington Commission, to plan for the electric and natural gas choices of our customers consistent with Washington State s climate goals. The law consolidates multiple existing system plans into an integrated plan, and will be followed by three years of rulemaking and planning prior to the submission in 2027 of PSE s first integrated system plan to the Washington Commission. The law also clarifies the application of three regulatory mechanisms for PSE: Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN), Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) and accelerated depreciation. The law requires PSE to file a depreciation study with the Washington Commission that is intended to depreciate all natural gas plants in service as of July 1, 2024 to no later than January 1, 2050. As PSE s pending GRC was filed prior to the passage of the law, PSE will file depreciation studies in future rate proceedings in a manner that conforms with the law. PSE filed a depreciation study with the Washington Commission as part of its GRC filing on February 15, 2024 which includes a request to shorten the depreciable lives of its natural gas assets by roughly ten years in most cases which is reflective of the current useful life of the assets. Further reductions of the depreciable lives are possible in future rate cases. For additional information on PSE's GRC filings, see Note 7, "Regulation and Rates" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. 
 On March 29, 2024, senate bill 5950 approved Washington State's operating budget, which included 150.0 million for public and private utilities to provide one-time bill rebates for low-and moderate-income residential electric customers. PSE received a total of 45.9 million during the third quarter of 2024, and provided rebates to low-and moderate-income residential electric customers.

Access to Debt Capital 
 PSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term capital markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy. Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade. However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company's ability to refinance existing or issue new long-term debt or obtain access to new or renew existing credit facilities, could increase the cost of issuing long-term debt and maintaining credit facilities, and could impact the Company's ability to pay dividends. For example, under Puget Energy's and PSE's credit facilities, the borrowing costs increase as their respective credit ratings decline due to increases in credit spreads and commitment fees. If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or generating capacity acquisitions, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected. PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs. 
 
 Regulatory Compliance Costs and Expenditures 
 PSE's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover electric system reliability, natural gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas. Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality, climate change and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation by-products such as coal ash), remediation of contaminated sites and the environmental impacts of siting new facilities also impact the Company's operations. PSE must spend significant resources to fulfill requirements set by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates on measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees. 
 In 2021, the Washington Legislature adopted the CCA, which establishes a GHG emissions cap-and-invest program that requires covered entities to purchase allowances to cover their GHG emissions with a cap on available allowances beginning on January 1, 2023 that declines annually through 2050. The WDOE published final regulations to implement the program on September 29, 2022, effective October 30, 2022. The WDOE also indicated that it will have subsequent rulemakings building off initial rulemaking while program implementation is underway and progress with Washington carbon goals are evaluated. 
 While the Washington Commission has approved the recovery of natural gas CCA-related costs, which has led to increases in costs to customers, it has indicated these revenues are subject-to-refund, and there is a risk PSE may ultimately not be able to recover all costs. Electric CCA-related costs have not yet been approved for recovery at this time and it is uncertain what obligation may be borne by customers or at risk for recovery. PSE faces continued risks associated with the program, including the evolving nature of the CCA rulemaking and related interpretation of the rules, unresolved recovery methodology for CCA s impact on energy costs, company costs, customer rate impacts, and cash, liquidity and credit volatility. For additional information, see Note 7, "Regulation and Rates" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. 
 Compliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change, could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 

Other Challenges and Strategies 
 Competition 
 PSE s electric and natural gas utility retail customers generally do not have the ability to choose their electric or natural gas supplier; therefore, PSE s business has historically been recognized as a natural and regulated monopoly. However, PSE faces competition from public utility districts and municipalities or efforts by citizens organizing to form such entities that want to establish their own government-owned utility, as a result of which PSE may lose a number of customers. PSE also faces increasing competition for sales to its retail customers through alternative methods of electric energy generation, including solar and other self-generation methods. In addition, PSE s natural gas customers may elect to use heating oil, propane or other fuels instead of using and purchasing natural gas from PSE. 
 Additionally, PSE faces increasing competition from other entities, primarily in the technology sector, where several large companies have entered into power purchase agreements to meet their growing energy needs, which will largely be used to fulfill commitments for additional cloud computing, artificial intelligence data centers, reduced carbon emissions and increased reliance on renewable energy sources. The increasing competitive pressure may impact the Company's ability to acquire generation and transmission resources and/or increase the cost to acquire such resources.

Results of Operations 
 Puget Sound Energy 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document. The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE s results of operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Electric and Natural Gas Margins 
 The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and natural gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a presentation that is not defined by GAAP. The presentation of electric margin and natural gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE s operating performance. Electric margin and natural gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of revenue from its customers in order to provide adequate recovery of operating costs, including interest and equity returns. PSE s electric margin and natural gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies electric margin and natural gas margin measures. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. 
 The following table presents operating income and a reconciliation of utility electric and natural gas margins to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income: 
 Puget Sound Energy (Dollars in Thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Operating income (loss) (60,293) 66,466 211,688 199,179 Electric operating revenue 736,113 770,406 2,434,458 2,461,205 Purchased electricity (250,822) (250,384) (892,436) (817,739) Electric generation fuel (78,305) (127,729) (241,293) (342,130) Residential exchange 17,477 14,547 61,630 54,259 Electric margin (non-GAAP) 424,463 406,840 1,362,359 1,355,595 Natural gas operating revenue 184,090 161,266 1,019,434 948,664 Purchased natural gas (68,243) (56,992) (472,776) (407,391) Natural gas margin (non-GAAP) 115,847 104,274 546,658 541,273 Other operating revenue 40 933 222 16,271 Unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net (108,979) 21,695 (131,712) (201,230) Utility operation and maintenance (183,915) (179,630) (579,697) (549,118) Non-utility expense and other (5,719) (3,342) (15,912) (18,076) Depreciation and amortization (225,135) (210,666) (676,630) (648,002) Taxes other than income taxes (76,895) (73,638) (293,600) (297,534) Operating income (loss) (60,293) 66,466 211,688 199,179

Electric Margin 
 Electric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs, to bring electric energy to PSE's service territory. 
 The following chart displays the details of PSE's electric margin changes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 ______________ 
 Includes decoupling cash collections, ROR excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to 2023 
 Electric Operating Revenue 
 Electric operating revenues decreased 34.3 million from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in sales to other utilities of 107.2 million, a decrease in decoupling revenue of 12.0 million and a decrease in transportation and other revenue of 3.1 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in electric retail sales of 84.7 million and an increase in other decoupling revenue of 3.4 million. These items are discussed in detail below. 
 Electric retail sales increased 84.7 million due to an increase of 60.5 million in rates compared to the prior year and by 24.2 million from an increase in retail electricity usage of 3.5 . The increase in rates is primarily due to the tariffs filed pursuant to the Company's 2024 variable power cost update effective January 1, 2024 and rate increases from the 2022 GRC. See "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 2 of this report and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 for electric rate changes. The increase in retail usage was primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial usage of 7.3 and 0.6 , respectively. The increase in customer usage was driven by an 18.3 increase in heating degree days, which was partially offset by an 8.0 decrease in cooling degree days in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Sales to other utilities decreased 107.2 million primarily due to a 40.0 decrease in the average price of electric wholesale sales and a 36.0 decrease in wholesale sales volume. Lower wholesale power prices were a result of 
 43 

lower natural gas prices and compounded by moderate loads during the period. The decrease in wholesale sales volume was driven by a reduction in combustion turbine (CT) and coal generation of 22.5 and 14.6 , respectively, as it was less economic to dispatch in the three months ended September 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Decoupling revenue decreased 12.0 million which was attributable to 9.6 million and 2.4 million decreases in delivery deferral revenues and fixed production cost (FPC) deferral revenues, respectively. This was driven primarily by increased usage in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Other decoupling revenue increased 3.4 million primarily due to changes in amortization rates. In the three months ended September 30, 2024 more overcollected balances were amortized as compared to 2023. 
 Transportation and other revenue decreased 3.1 million primarily due to a 4.4 million decrease in net wholesale non-core natural gas sales. The decrease in wholesale non-core natural gas sales was primarily driven by an increase of 5.7 million in financial hedging costs in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 
 Electric Power Costs 
 Electric power costs decreased 51.9 million primarily due to a decrease of electric generation fuel costs of 49.4 million and an increase in residential exchange credits of 2.9 million. These items are discussed in detail below: 
 Electric generation fuel decreased 49.4 million primarily due to a 48.0 million decrease in natural gas fuel costs resulting from lower natural gas prices and decreased gas-fired CT generation of 29.3 as well as lower Colstrip fuel expense of 1.4 million driven by reduced coal generation of 14.6 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Residential exchange credits increased by 2.9 million due to a 0.4 change in the amount of credits to be passed back to customers effective November 1, 2023 and an increase in residential usage of 7.3 as discussed above in electric retail sales; see "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 2 of this report. 
 
 44 

The following chart displays the details of PSE's electric margin changes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 ______________ 
 Includes decoupling cash collections, ROR excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to 2023 
 Electric Operating Revenue 
 Electric operating revenues decreased 26.7 million from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in sales to other utilities of 159.9 million, a decrease in transportation and other revenue of 68.9 million and a decrease in decoupling revenue of 3.9 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in electric retail sales of 189.1 million and an increase in other decoupling revenue of 16.9 million. These items are discussed in detail below. 
 Electric retail sales increased 189.1 million due to an increase of 180.5 million in rates compared to the prior year and 8.6 million from an increase in retail electricity usage of 0.4 . The increase in rates is primarily due to the tariffs filed pursuant to the Company's 2024 variable power cost update effective January 1, 2024 and rate increases from the 2022 GRC. See "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 2 of this report and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 for electric rate changes. The increase in retail usage was primarily due to an increase in residential usage of 1.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Sales to other utilities decreased 159.9 million primarily due to a 38.7 decrease in the average price of electric wholesale sales and a 5.9 decrease in wholesale sales volume. Lower wholesale power prices were a result of lower natural gas prices and compounded by moderate loads during the period. The decrease in wholesale sales volume was driven by a reduction in total CT and coal generation of 3.8 and 22.0 , respectively, as it was less economic to dispatch in the nine months ended September 2024 compared to 2023. 
 45 

Decoupling revenue decreased 3.9 million which was attributable to an 8.1 million decrease and a 4.2 million increase in delivery deferral revenues and FPC deferral revenues, respectively. This was driven primarily by increased usage offset by lower FPC rates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Other decoupling revenue increased 16.9 million primarily due to changes in amortization rates. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 more overcollected balances were amortized as compared to 2023. 
 Transportation and other revenue decreased 68.9 million primarily due to a 65.3 million decrease in net wholesale non-core natural gas sales. The decrease in wholesale non-core natural gas sales was primarily driven by an increase of 44.4 million in financial hedging costs in 2024 compared to 2023 as natural gas hedges moved to a loss in 2024 as compared to a gain in 2023. Additionally, net wholesale non-core natural gas sales decreased 20.9 million which was primarily driven by a 13.7 decrease in the volume of natural gas sold. 
 
 Electric Power Costs 
 Electric power costs decreased 33.5 million primarily due to a decrease of electric generation fuel costs of 100.8 million and an increase in residential exchange credits of 7.4 million; partially offset by an increase of 74.7 million of purchased electricity costs. These items are discussed in detail below: 
 Purchased electricity expense increased 74.7 million primarily due to increased wholesale purchase prices, which were 8.3 higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. Higher average wholesale purchase prices were driven by open market purchases as well as PPA contracts added after September 30, 2023. Additionally, wholesale electricity purchase volumes increased marginally by 0.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Electric generation fuel decreased 100.8 million primarily due to a 93.3 million decrease in natural gas fuel costs resulting from lower natural gas prices and decreased gas-fired CT generation of 7.1 . Further, Colstrip fuel expense decreased 7.5 million driven by a planned major maintenance outage that reduced coal generation by 22.0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Residential exchange credits increased by 7.4 million due to a 0.4 change in the amount of credits to be passed back to customers effective November 1, 2023 and an increase in residential usage of 1.1 as discussed above in electric retail sales; see "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 2 of this report. 
 
 46 

Natural Gas Margin 
 Natural gas margin is natural gas sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of natural gas purchased, including transportation costs to bring natural gas to PSE s service territory. The PGA mechanism passes through increases or decreases in the natural gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates to customers based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in natural gas pipeline transportation costs. PSE's margin or net income is not affected by changes under the PGA mechanism because over- and under-recoveries of natural gas costs included in baseline PGA rates are deferred and either refunded to or collected from customers in future periods. 
 The following chart displays the details of PSE's natural gas margin changes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 ______________ 
 Includes decoupling cash collections, ROR excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to 2023 
 Natural Gas Operating Revenue 
 Natural gas operating revenue increased 22.8 million primarily due to an increase in transportation and other revenue of 39.9 million, which was partially offset by decreases in retail sales of 14.4 million and other decoupling revenue of 2.5 million. These items are discussed in detail below. 
 Natural gas retail sales revenue decreased 14.4 million primarily due to a decrease in rates of 16.1 million that was partially offset by a marginal increase in natural gas load of 0.5 , or 1.7 million. The decrease in rates is due to a decrease in the Company's most recent PGA rates effective November 2023, which is partially offset by an increase in rates driven by Schedule 111 that includes a charge for CCA allowance costs and a pass back of CCA auction proceeds. See "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 2 of this report for natural gas rate changes. 
 Other decoupling revenue decreased 2.5 million primarily due to changes in amortization rates. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, more undercollected balances were amortized as compared to 2023. 
 47 

Transportation and other revenue increased 39.9 million primarily due to 41.2 million related to the regulatory offset of CCA auction proceeds passed back to customers, which were passed through to customers as credits on billed revenue included within natural gas retail revenues above and an increase in transportation revenue of 2.2 million. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of 4.7 million due to the Company s deferred return on its investment in the Tacoma LNG Facility that was recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and included in rates under Schedule 141LNG in the three months ended September 30, 2024. See Part I, Item 1, Note 7 "Regulation and Rates" included in this report for further details. 
 
 Natural Gas Energy Costs 
 Purchased natural gas expense increased 11.3 million primarily due to an increase of 38.2 million in amortization of deferred CCA emission allowance costs, which were passed through to customers as billed revenue included within natural gas retail revenues above and an increase in natural gas usage of 0.5 as stated in the natural gas retail sales section above. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the PGA rates in November 2023. See "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 2 of this report for natural gas rate changes and details on the PGA. 
 
 The following chart displays the details of PSE's natural gas margin changes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 ______________ 
 Includes decoupling cash collections, ROR excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to 2023 
 Natural Gas Operating Revenue 
 Natural gas operating revenue increased 70.8 million primarily due to increases in transportation and other revenue of 186.9 million, decoupling revenue of 8.5 million and increase in other decoupling revenue of 2.6 million; partially offset by a decrease in retail sales of 127.2 million. These items are discussed in detail below. 
 48 

Natural gas retail sales revenue decreased 127.2 million primarily due to a decrease in rates of 104.9 million and a decrease in natural gas load of 3.0 , or 22.3 million. The decrease in rates is due to a decrease in the Company's most recent PGA rates effective November 2023, which is partially offset by an increase in rates driven by Schedule 111 that includes a charge for CCA allowance costs and a pass back of CCA auction proceeds. See "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 2 of this report for natural gas rate changes. The decrease in load is primarily driven by decreased usage of 3.1 , 2.0 and 13.6 in residential, commercial and industrial customers, respectively due to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 being warmer than the same period in 2023. 
 Decoupling revenue increased 8.5 million primarily attributable to lower usage in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Other decoupling revenue increased 2.6 million primarily due to decreases in amortization rates related to prior period undercollections. 
 Transportation and other revenue increased 186.9 million primarily due to 206.0 million related to the regulatory offset of CCA auction proceeds passed back to customers, which were passed through to customers as credits on billed revenue included within natural gas retail revenues above and an increase in transportation revenue of 8.0 million. The increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease of 23.3 million due to the disallowance of the Company s deferred return on its investment in the Tacoma LNG Facility that was recorded between February 1, 2022, and January 11, 2023 as well as deferred return from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included in rates under Schedule 141LNG; and (ii) deferral related to the bill discount rider of 8.6 million. See Part I, Item 1, Note 7 "Regulation and Rates" included in this report for further details on the Washington Commissions order on Tacoma LNG. 
 
 Natural Gas Energy Costs 
 Purchased natural gas expense increased 65.4 million primarily due to an increase of 258.1 million in amortization of deferred CCA emission allowance costs, which were passed through to customers as billed revenue included within natural gas retail revenues above. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the PGA rates in November 2023 and a decrease in natural gas usage of 3.0 as stated in the natural gas retail sales section above. See "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 2 of this report for natural gas rate changes and details on the PGA.

Other Operating Expenses and Other Income (Deductions) 
 The following chart displays the details of PSE's operating expenses and other income (deductions) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to 2023 
 Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments decreased 130.7 million to a net loss of 109.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The primary driver was the decrease in the weighted average forward prices for electric and natural gas of 2.7 and 13.9 , respectively, which resulted in an increased loss of 171.5 million. The increase in loss was partially offset by a 40.9 million gain due to net settlement of electric and natural gas trades that were previously recorded as a loss. For further details, see Note 4, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. 
 Utility operations and maintenance expense increased 4.3 million primarily due to increases in the following: (i) 16.4 million due to an increase in Schedule 129 - low income program in electric and natural gas rates, see "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 2 of this report; and (ii) 4.9 million related to maintenance on other power generation and electric equipment. These increases were partially offset by decreases of (i) 9.4 million related to Clean Energy Implementation Plan (CEIP), transportation electrification, Colstrip and LNG tracker items and (ii) 7.1 million related to decreased maintenance of overhead lines in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 14.5 million due to: (i) 5.8 million increase in conservation amortization due to increases in conservation rates effective May 1, 2024, see "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 2 of this report, (ii) 2.6 million increase in electric distribution depreciation primarily driven by net additions of electric distribution underground conductors and device assets, (iii) 1.5 million increase in electric transmission depreciation primarily driven by net additions of electric transmission poles and fixtures, and (iv) 1.5 million increase in natural gas amortization driven by an increase in LNG deferrals. 
 Taxes other than income taxes increased 3.3 million primarily due to an increase of 4.9 million in state excise taxes driven by higher tax deductions in 2023 and an increase of 2.1 million in municipal taxes; partially offset by a 3.8 million decrease in property taxes. 
 50 

Other Income, Interest Expense and Income Tax Expense 
 Other income/expense increased 12.0 million from net other income of 13.8 million in 2023 to net other income of 25.8 million in 2024, due to an increase of 13.5 million in other income that was partially offset by an increase of 1.5 million in other expense. The increase in other income was primarily due to a 5.7 million increase in equity allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) due to an increase in eligible CWIP and AFUDC rate and an increase in taxable interest and dividend income of 4.0 million driven by interest income related to the investment of bond proceeds from the June 2024 bond issuances, for further details see Note 10, "Other" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. 
 Interest expense increased 8.6 million primarily due to an increase of 11.0 million in interest expense due to the June 2024 PSE bond issuances. This was partially offset by an increase in debt AFUDC of 3.1 million due to an increase in eligible CWIP and AFUDC rates. 
 Income tax expense decreased 19.1 million primarily driven by a decrease in pre-tax book income in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 
 Other Operating Expenses and Other Income (Deductions) 
 The following chart displays the details of PSE's operating expenses and other income (deductions) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to 2023 
 Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments decreased 69.5 million to a net loss of 131.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The primary driver was a 239.9 million decrease in the loss due to the net settlement of 124.8 million of electric and 115.1 million of natural gas trades previously recorded as loss. This was partially offset by a 170.4 million increase in loss due to a decrease in the weighted average forward prices for electric and natural gas of 4.8 and 18.1 , respectively. For further details, see Note 4, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. 
 51 

Utility operations and maintenance expense increased 30.6 million primarily due to increases in the following: (i) 20.6 million due to an increase in Schedule 129 - low income program in electric and natural gas rates, see "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 2 of this report, (ii) 6.7 million in Washington Commission and GRC related filing fees, (iii) 4.1 million in pension related expenses, (iv) 3.4 million related to maintenance on other power generation and electric equipment and (v) 2.5 million related to increased maintenance costs for emergent underground line work. These increases were partially offset by (i) 6.4 million related to CEIP, transportation electrification, Colstrip and LNG tracker items and (ii) 4.5 million related to a reduction in outside services costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 28.6 million due to: (i) 8.8 million increase in conservation amortization due to increases in conservation rates effective May 1, 2024, (ii) 7.3 million increase in electric distribution depreciation from 2023 primarily driven by net additions of electric distribution underground conductors and device assets, (iii) 4.9 million increase in electric transmission depreciation from 2023 primarily driven by net additions of electric transmission poles and fixtures, (iv) 3.4 million increase in natural gas distribution depreciation from 2023 primarily driven by net additions in natural gas distribution plastic mains assets, and (v) 2.5 million increase in natural gas amortization driven by an increase in LNG deferrals. These increases were partially offset by a 3.9 million decrease in electric amortization primarily due to a decrease in Get to Zero electric amortization. 
 Taxes other than income taxes decreased 3.9 million primarily due to a decrease in property taxes of 8.6 million, which were partially offset by an increase of 4.6 million in state excise, municipal, and other taxes. 
 
 Other Income, Interest Expense and Income Tax Expense 
 Other income/expense increased 19.0 million from net other income of 37.1 million in 2023 to net other income of 56.1 million in 2024, due to an increase of 24.8 million in other income partially offset by an increase of 5.8 million in other expense. The increase in other income was primarily due to a 12.6 million increase in equity AFUDC due to an increase in eligible CWIP and AFUDC rate, an increase in taxable interest and dividend income of 4.1 million driven by interest income related to the investment of bond proceeds from the June 2024 bond issuances, for further details see Note 10, "Other" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report, and an increase of 4.1 million in the non-service cost component of the qualified pension net periodic benefit cost for 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in other expense was primarily due to 4.9 million related to Colstrip major maintenance. 
 Interest expense increased 18.5 million primarily due to an increase of 21.8 million in interest expense due to the May 2023 and June 2024 PSE bond issuances, 3.8 million due to the CCA natural gas recovery and 2.9 million other interest expense. This was partially offset by an increase in debt AFUDC of 9.6 million due to an increase in eligible CWIP and AFUDC rates. 
 Income tax expense increased 1.7 million primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax book income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023.

Puget Energy 
 Primarily, all operations of Puget Energy are conducted through PSE. Puget Energy's net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 
 Summary Results of Operation 
 Puget Energy s net income decreased by 115.8 million. This is primarily due to: (i) a decrease in PSE's net income of 104.3 million, (ii) an increase in income tax expense of 7.6 million driven by the change in pre-tax book income, and (iii) an increase in interest expense of 3.3 million due to a higher amount drawn on the Puget Energy line of credit in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 53 

Puget Energy's net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 
 Summary Results of Operation 
 Puget Energy s net income increased by 21.9 million. This is primarily attributable to an increase in PSE's net income of 11.3 million, a decrease in tax expense of 16.7 million driven by the change in pre-tax book income and a decrease in net loss of 7.0 million at Puget LNG. The increases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 11.8 million due to a higher amount drawn on the Puget Energy line of credit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 

Capital Requirements 
 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 In addition to the contractual obligations and consolidated commercial commitments disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into new Electric Portfolio and Electric Wholesale Market Transaction contracts with estimated payment obligations totaling 2.7 billion through 2053. 
 For further information, see Part II, Item 8, Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition. The Company does have standby letter of credit arrangements. 
 54 

For more information, see Note 10, "Other" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Utility Construction Program 
 The Company s construction programs for generating facilities, the electric transmission system, the natural gas and electric distribution systems and the Tacoma LNG facility are designed to meet regulatory requirements, support customer growth and improve energy system reliability. The Company had adjusted capital expenditures, resulting in a decrease of 173.3 million compared to forecasted amounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to underruns of (i) strategic project spend driven by timing and project schedule constraints, (ii) electric reliability initiatives driven by project savings, (iii) generation driven by the timing of project spend, (iv) product development driven by delays and transition to purchased power agreements reducing capital spend, and (v) IT operations spend driven by timing of project spend. Construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, totaled 1,143.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Presently planned utility construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, are as follows: 
 
 Capital Expenditure Projections (Dollars in Millions) 2024 2025 2026 Total energy delivery, technology and facilities expenditures 1,716.0 1,936.4 2,231.7 
 
 The program is subject to change based upon general business, economic and regulatory conditions. Utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures may be funded from a combination of sources, which may include cash from operations, short-term debt, long-term debt and/or equity. PSE s planned capital expenditures may result in a level of spending that will exceed its cash flow from operations. As a result, execution of PSE s strategy is dependent in part on continued access to capital markets.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 
 Cash generated from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 265.7 million, which includes a net income increase of 11.3 million. The following are significant factors that impacted PSE's cash flows from operations: 
 Cash flows resulting from non-cash items increased 28.0 million primarily due to: (i) an increase in deferred income taxes of 82.8 million, (ii) an increase in depreciation and amortization of 19.8 million and (iii) an increase of 8.8 million in conservation amortization. The increases were partially offset by: (i) a 69.5 million change in net 
 55 

unrealized loss on derivative instruments from 201.2 million in 2023 to 131.7 million in 2024 and (ii) a change in equity AFUDC of 12.6 million. 
 Cash flows resulting from changes in working capital increased 55.1 million primarily due to: (i) accounts payable decreased faster in 2023 compared to 2024, which led to increased cash inflow of 209.0 million, (ii) a reduction in prepayment for purchased electricity led to 29.3 million of cash inflow, (iii) 800.0 million of senior secured notes issued in June 2024 resulted in additional interest expense accruals, which led to increased cash inflow of 10.9 million and (iv) a more gradual increase in material and fuel inventory, which increased 17.3 million in 2024 compared to 24.6 million increase in 2023, led to 7.3 million increase of cash inflow. The increases were partially offset by: (i) cash outflow of 174.2 million due to the timing of accounts receivable collections, as the balance of accounts receivable decreased 193.8 million in 2024 compared to a decrease of 368.1 million in 2023 and (ii) cash outflow of 28.9 million due to the change in tax payable balance. 
 Cash flows resulting from regulatory assets and liabilities decreased 144.1 million, which was primarily due to: (i) cash outflow of 97.1 million related to PCA mechanism, which increased 32.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a decrease of 64.5 million in the same period of 2023, (ii) cash outflow of 25.2 million related to revenue decoupling mechanism, which had marginal change in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a decrease of 24.3 million in the same period of 2023, (iii) a 17.4 million decrease driven by recovery of the Crisis Affected Customer Assistance Program through Schedule 129 during the nine months ended 2023, at which point the program was fully recovered, thus there was no recovery in the same period of 2024, and (iv) major maintenance and major inspections at several generation stations in 2024 that led to higher cash outflow of 7.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Cash flows resulting from purchased gas adjustment decreased 246.4 million, which was mainly driven by an increase in actual natural gas cost and a decrease in allowed PGA recovery in 2024 compared to 2023. Actual natural gas costs led to a 24.8 million increase in 2024 compared to 2023. Meanwhile, the total amount of allowed PGA recovery in 2024 decreased 193.7 million compared to 2023. In addition, there was a 27.9 million refund, including interest, from a counterparty settlement received in 2023. 
 Cash flow resulting from GHG emission allowances increased 28.1 million, which was due to a lower cost to obtain the Washington emission allowances for GHG emissions associated with the Company's electric and natural gas business activities in compliance with the CCA as the emission allowance prices were lower in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 
 Cash generated from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in addition to the changes discussed at PSE above, decreased by 4.5 million compared to the same period in 2023, which includes a net income increase of 10.7 million. The remaining change was primarily impacted by the factors explained below: 
 Non-cash items decreased 18.4 million primarily due to the change in deferred income taxes. 
 Changes in cash flow resulting from working capital increased 3.4 million primarily due to (i) a 1.3 million increase due to an increase in accrual of interest expense driven by increased borrowing on credit facility and (ii) a 1.4 million increase related to the change in PSE's intercompany account receivable and account payable balances with Puget LNG and Puget Energy, which are eliminated upon consolidation of Puget Energy.

Financing Program 
 The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs. The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt. Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy s and PSE s credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity through its credit facilities and access to capital markets to fund its needs over the next twelve months. 
 Proceeds from PSE s short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility construction programs. Puget Energy and PSE continue to have reasonable access to the capital and credit markets. 
 As of September 30, 2024, both Puget Energy and PSE have stable outlooks from Moody s, Fitch, and S P. Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt whose maturity would be accelerated upon a ratings downgrade, Management continually monitors the credit rating environment for both Puget Energy and PSE as a credit rating downgrade may increase the cost of borrowing for Puget Energy and PSE in future long-term financings or under their existing credit facilities. Any increase in the cost of borrowing could negatively impact Puget Energy and PSE's future results of operations as well as future liquidity, access to debt capital resources and financial condition. Additionally, a ratings downgrade could impact the Company's ability to issue dividends. A downgrade to Puget Energy and PSE's credit ratings would not impact debt covenants under our existing credit facilities nor would it impact other contracts, as neither include credit rating triggering event clauses. A credit rating decrease for PSE could result in increased cash collateral required for commodity contracts, which would adversely affect PSE's liquidity. Management cannot predict with certainty the actions credit agencies may take, if any, in response to weaker near term credit metrics, regulatory and rate recovery uncertainties, and management's efforts to contain the growth of capital and operating expenditures. Containing the growth of capital and operating expenditures will be limited, over the near term, due to continuing strategic and risk mitigation imperatives and the necessity of providing safe, reliable and resilient service levels to customers. 
 
 Puget Sound Energy 
 Debt Restrictive Covenants 
 The type and amount of future long-term financings for PSE may be limited by provisions in PSE's electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. 
 PSE s ability to issue additional secured debt may also be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. Under the most restrictive tests at September 30, 2024, PSE could issue: 
 Approximately 0.7 billion of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s electric mortgage indenture based on approximately 1.2 billion of electric bondable property available for issuance, subject to an interest coverage ratio limitation of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the electric utility mortgage), which PSE exceeded at September 30, 2024; and 
 Approximately 1.0 billion of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately 1.7 billion of natural gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined natural gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a natural gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, PSE had approximately 9.2 billion in electric and natural gas rate base to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest. 
 
 Dividend Payment Restrictions 
 The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. At September 30, 2024, approximately 1.8 billion of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant. 
 Beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the merger order by the Washington Commission, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0 or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission. Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter period prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3.0 to 
 57 

1.0. The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 47.9 at September 30, 2024, and the EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 4.7 to 1.0 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants. At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends. 
 For more information on PSE's credit facilities, long term debt, demand promissory note, and shelf registrations see Part I, Item 1, Note 10, "Other" of this report and Part II, Item 8, Note 7, "Long-Term Debt" and Note 8, "Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Puget Energy 
 Dividend Payment Restrictions 
 Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission in 2009. Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2.0 to 1.0. Puget Energy's EBITDA to interest expense was 3.5 to 1.0 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends. 
 For further information on Puget Energy's credit facilities, shelf registrations, and long-term debt, see Part I, Item 1, Note 10, "Other" included in this report and Part II, Item 8, Note 7, "Long-Term Debt" and Note 8, "Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Washington Clean Energy Transformation Act 
 In May 2019, Washington passed the CETA, which supports Washington's clean energy economy and transitioning to a clean, affordable, and reliable energy future. The CETA requires all electric utilities to eliminate coal-fired generation from their electric supply to customers by December 31, 2025; requires all electric utilities to be carbon-neutral by January 1, 2030 through a combination of non-emitting electric generation, renewable generation, and/or alternative compliance options; and makes it the state policy that, by 2045, 100 of electric generation and retail electricity sales will come from renewable or non-emitting resources. CEIPs are required every four years from each investor-owned utility (IOU). The plan must propose interim targets for meeting the 2045 standard between 2030 and 2045 and describe an actionable plan that the IOU intends to pursue to meet the standard. The Washington Commission may approve, reject or recommend alterations to an IOU s plan. The Company intends to seek recovery of any costs associated with CETA through the regulatory process. On December 17, 2021, PSE filed its final CEIP, which proposed a plan for the implementation of CETA for 2022-2025 and associated project costs. On June 6, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s CEIP, subject to conditions. On November 2, 2023, PSE filed a Biennial CEIP Update with the Washington Commission. 
 
 Washington Climate Commitment Act 
 In 2021, Washington adopted the CCA, which establishes a GHG emissions cap-and-invest program that requires covered entities, including electric and gas utilities, to purchase allowances to cover their GHG emissions with a cap on available allowances beginning on January 1, 2023 that declines annually through 2050. The WDOE published final regulations on September 29, 2022, effective October 30, 2022. Allowances can be obtained through quarterly auctions, or bought and sold on a secondary market. 
 As an electric utility, PSE is required to obtain emission allowances or offset credits for GHG emissions associated with electricity generated in or imported into the state to serve Washington load, and all electricity generated by Washington PSE facilities with total annual emissions exceeding 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. As an electric utility subject to Washington s CETA, which is discussed below, PSE receives emission allowances from WDOE at no cost through 2050 for direct emissions associated with electricity used to serve Washington State load to eliminate the cost burden of the program on electric ratepayers. 
 58 

As a gas utility, PSE is required to obtain emission allowances for GHG emissions associated with (i) natural gas supplied to customers and (ii) any natural gas system associated facilities with emissions that exceed 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. PSE receives some no-cost emission allowances from WDOE to mitigate impacts to natural gas ratepayers. WDOE's allocation of no-cost allowances to PSE is based on a percentage of PSE baseline natural gas system related emissions (determined from 2015-2019 natural gas system related emissions) and declines annually in proportion with the Washington State carbon goals reaching zero no-cost allowances in 2050. 
 Offset credit use is limited and is not additive to allowances; the WDOE subtracts any offsets used from the total allowance budget. In the first compliance period, 2023-2026, participating entities can cover up to 5 of their emissions with offset credits, and can cover an additional 3 with credits from projects on federally recognized Tribal lands. In the second compliance period, 2027-2030, the general limit drops to 4 , with an additional 2 from projects on Tribal lands. 
 In 2023, the WDOE announced an intent to pursue an agreement with California to link with its cap and trade program which is administered by the California Air Resources Board. 
 
 Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development 
 For further information, see Part I, Item 1 Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Environmental Remediation 
 The Company is subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. A potentially responsible party has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. In instances where we have been designated a potentially responsible party by the Environmental Protection Agency or state environmental agency, we are potentially liable for the cost of remediating contamination at current work sites and former work sites. Such sites include former manufactured gas plants operated by PSE predecessors, such as Gas Works Park on the shore of Lake Union in Seattle, and contaminated facilities with other connections to PSE predecessors, such as the location of a long-defunct creosote manufacturer which had purchased waste products from PSE predecessors (e.g. Quendall Terminals site on Lake Washington in Renton, Washington). In each case, PSE assesses, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our environmental remediation obligations related to the contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. PSE develops a range of reasonably estimable costs that includes a low and high end of a range for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. Liabilities are recorded based on the best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites. It s possible that costs are incurred in excess of the recorded amounts because of changes in laws and/or regulations, the solvency of other liable parties, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties and/or from customers under a Washington Commission order. 
 
 Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships Program 
 In 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law, which among other investments and programs, established the U.S. Department of Energy s (DOE) Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program. The GRIP program was established to enhance grid flexibility and improve the resilience of the power system against growing threats of extreme weather and climate change. As of the date of this report, PSE has been selected for three grant awards under the GRIP program either through individual applications or participating in consortium grant applications: (i) PSE participated in the North Plains Connector grant consortium along with other utilities in the Pacific Northwest region that on August 7, 2024 was selected for a grant of 700.0 million of federal cost sharing; (ii) PSE applied for the Skagit River Valley Transformation for Climate Resiliency project that was selected on October 18, 2024 for a grant of 45.8 million of federal cost sharing; and (iii) PSE partnered in a coalition with E Source and other Pacific Northwest utilities on the Increasing Energy Resilience via Technology Investment Acceleration project, which was selected on October 18, 2024 for a grant of 77.0 million of federal cost sharing. As of the time of this report, all three grants must complete award negotiations and proceed to a signed award with the DOE in order to receive federal cost sharing funds. Thus, at this time, the Company cannot predict the timing or amount of federal cost sharing that will be received.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
 
 The Company is exposed to various forms of market risk, consisting primarily of adverse changes in commodity prices, counterparty credit risk, as well as interest rate risk. PSE actively manages market risk and maintains risk policies and procedures designed to discourage unauthorized risk-taking, reduce commodity price volatility, and manage the various risks inherent to the energy portfolio. There have been no material changes to market risks affecting the Company from those set forth in Part II, Item 7A - "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 The nature of serving regulated electric and natural gas customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks. PSE s Energy Risk Management Committee establishes energy risk management policies and procedures to manage commodity and volatility risks and the related effects on credit, tax, accounting, financing and liquidity. 
 PSE's objective is to minimize commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios. It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading. PSE hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices. 
 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 PSE is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve customers. Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty's non-performance under an agreement. PSE manages credit risk with policies and procedures for counterparty analysis and measurement, monitoring and mitigation of exposure. Additionally, PSE has entered into commodity master arrangements (i.e., WSPP, ISDA or NAESB) with its counterparties to mitigate credit exposure. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short-term debt instruments and anticipated long-term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements. The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varied maturities. The Company utilizes internal cash from operations and borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs. During periods of financial market or interest rate volatility, the Company may utilize its credit facilities for short term funding needs instead of the commercial paper program. Credit facility borrowings are based on a more stable base rate and the credit spread is fixed. Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable. The Company may also enter into swaps or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with the debt. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Puget Energy

 Under the supervision and with the participation of PSE s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, PSE has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of PSE concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in PSE s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, PSE s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 Contingencies arising out of the Company's normal course of business existed as of September 30, 2024. Litigation is subject to numerous uncertainties and the Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. For further details, see Note 8, "Commitments and Contingencies" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. 
 SEC regulations require the Company to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental provisions if the Company reasonably believes that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations and given the size of the Company's operations, the Company elected a threshold of 1.0 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any matters that exceed this threshold and meet the definition for disclosure. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Although the Company has not been materially affected, the following represents an ongoing risk that the Company continues to monitor. 
 
 The changing resource composition of the region and within PSE s generation portfolio may be insufficient to meet customers energy demands. Growing variance in actual and forecasted load or generation could impact the cost of balancing generation resources and may inhibit the Company s ability to meet retail load obligations or make PSE more reliant on wholesale markets which could have a significant impact on energy costs. Furthermore, as climate change results in more frequent extreme weather conditions and seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced, the variability of load and generation increase. As the Company and other utilities in the region continue to add solar- and wind-powered generation capacity, each of which is a climate-dependent resource, the Company s ability to reliably and cost effectively serve retail loads may become more challenging, adversely impacting the Company s financial condition, customer satisfaction, and reputation. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) , or modified a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933).
