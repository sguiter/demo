 The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and regulations for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. All adjustments to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are of a normal, recurring nature and, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods.

 . Transient Sites are leased to customers on a short-term basis. We do not separate expenses reimbursed by our customers utility recoveries from the associated rental income as we meet the practical expedient criteria of ASC 842, Leases to combine the lease and non-lease components. We assessed the criteria and concluded that the timing and pattern of transfer for rental income and the associated utility recoveries are the same and, as our leases qualify as operating leases, we account for and present rental income and utility recoveries as a single component under Rental income in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In addition, customers may lease homes that are located in our communities. These leases are accounted for as operating leases. Rental income derived from customers leasing homes is also accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases and is recognized over the term of the respective lease. The allowance for credit losses related to the collectability of lease receivables is presented as a reduction to Rental income. Lease receivables are presented within Other assets, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are net of an allowance for credit losses. The estimate for credit losses is a result of our ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability, including historical loss experience, current market conditions and future expectations in forecasting credit losses.

 reportable segments: (i) Property Operations and (ii) Home Sales and Rentals Operations. The Property Operations segment owns and operates land lease Properties and the Home Sales and Rentals Operations segment purchases, sells and leases homes at the Properties. The distribution of the Properties throughout the United States reflects our belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio from regional economic influences. 
 All revenues were from external customers and there is no customer who contributed 10 or more of our total revenues during the quarters or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ), as well as information in Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview and Outlook 
 We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust REIT with headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. We are a fully integrated owner of lifestyle-oriented properties Properties consisting of property operations and home sales and rental operations primarily within manufactured home MH and recreational vehicle RV communities and marinas. As of September 30, 2024, we owned or had an ownership interest in a portfolio of 452 Properties located throughout the United States and Canada containing 172,870 individual developed areas Sites ). These Properties are located in 35 states and British Columbia, with more than 110 Properties with lake, river or ocean frontage and more than 120 Properties within ten miles of the coastal United States. 
 We invest in properties in sought-after locations near retirement and vacation destinations and urban areas across the United States with a focus on delivering an exceptional experience to our residents and guests that results in delivery of value to stockholders. Our business model is intended to provide an opportunity for increased cash flows and appreciation in value. We seek growth in earnings, Funds from Operations FFO ), Normalized Funds from Operations Normalized FFO and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our Properties and investments. We accomplish this by attracting and retaining high quality customers to our Properties, who take pride in our Properties and in their homes and efficiently managing our Properties by increasing occupancy, maintaining competitive market rents and controlling expenses. We also actively pursue opportunities that fit our acquisition criteria and are currently engaged in various stages of negotiations relating to the possible acquisition of additional properties. 
 We believe the demand from baby boomers for MH and RV communities will continue to be strong over the long term. It is estimated that approximately 10,000 baby boomers are turning 65 daily through 2029. These individuals, seeking an active lifestyle, will continue to drive the market for second-home sales as vacation properties, investment opportunities or retirement retreats. We expect it is likely that over the next decade, we will continue to see high levels of second-home sales and that manufactured homes and cottages in our Properties will continue to provide a viable second-home alternative to site-built homes. We also believe the Millennial and Generation Z demographic will contribute to our future long-term customer pipeline. After conducting a comprehensive study of RV ownership, according to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association RVIA ), data suggested that RV sales are expected to benefit from an increase in demand from those born in the United States from 1980 to 2003, or Millennials and Generation Z, over the coming years. We believe the demand from baby boomers and these younger generations will continue to outpace supply for MH and RV communities. The entitlement process to develop new MH and RV communities is extremely restrictive. As a result, there have been limited new communities developed in our target geographic markets. 
 We generate the majority of our revenues from customers renting our Sites or entering into right-to-use contracts, also known as membership subscriptions, which provide them access to specific Properties for limited stays. MH Sites are generally leased on an annual basis to residents who own or lease factory-built homes, including manufactured homes. Annual RV and marina Sites are leased on an annual basis to customers who generally have an RV, factory-built cottage, boat or other unit placed on the site, including those Northern properties that are open for the summer season. Seasonal RV and marina Sites are leased to customers generally for one to six months. Transient RV and marina Sites are leased to customers on a short-term basis. The revenue from seasonal and transient Sites is generally higher during the first and third quarters. We consider the transient revenue stream to be our most volatile as it is subject to weather conditions and other factors affecting the marginal RV customer s vacation and travel preferences. We also generate revenue from customers renting our marina dry storage. Additionally, we have interests in joint venture Properties for which revenue is classified as Equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

Management's Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

 The following table shows the breakdown of our Sites by type (amounts are approximate): 
 Total Sites as of September 30, 2024 MH Sites 73,000 RV Sites: Annual 34,400 Seasonal 11,800 Transient 17,000 Marina Slips 6,900 Membership (1) 
 26,000 Joint Ventures (2) 
 3,800 Total 172,900 
 _________________________ 
 (1) Primarily utilized to service approximately 117,400 members. Includes approximately 5,900 Sites rented on an annual basis. 
 (2) Includes approximately 2,000 annual Sites and 1,800 transient Sites. 
 In our Home Sales and Rentals Operations business, our revenue streams include home sales, home rentals and brokerage services and ancillary activities. We generate revenue through home sales and rental operations by selling or leasing manufactured homes and cottages that are located in Properties owned and managed by us. We believe renting our vacant homes represents an attractive source of occupancy and an opportunity to convert the renter to a homebuyer in the future. Additionally, home sale brokerage services are offered to our residents who may choose to sell their homes rather than relocate them when moving from a Property. At certain Properties, we operate ancillary facilities, such as golf courses, pro shops, stores and restaurants. 
 In the manufactured housing industry, options for home financing, also known as chattel financing, are limited. Chattel financing options available today include community owner-funded programs or third-party lender programs that provide subsidized financing to customers and often require the community owner to guarantee customer defaults. Third-party lender programs have stringent underwriting criteria, sizable down payment requirements, short term loan amortization and high interest rates. We have a limited program under which we purchase loans made by an unaffiliated lender to homebuyers at our Properties. 
 In addition to net income computed in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ), we assess and measure our overall financial and operating performance using certain Non-GAAP supplemental measures, which include: (i) FFO, (ii) Normalized FFO, (iii) Income from property operations, (iv) Income from property operations, excluding property management, and (v) Core Portfolio income from property operations, excluding property management (operating results for Properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison). We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Definitions and reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included below in this discussion.

 Core property operating revenues increased 4.4 and Core income from property operations, excluding property management increased 5.8 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Core property operating revenues increased 4.9 and Core income from property operations, excluding property management increased 6.2 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 21 

Management's Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

 We continue to focus on the quality of occupancy growth by increasing the number of manufactured homeowners in our Core Portfolio. Our Core Portfolio average occupancy includes both homeowners and renters in our MH communities and was 95.0 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 94.9 for each of the quarters ended December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our Core Portfolio occupancy increased by 107 sites, which included an increase in homeowner occupancy of 111 sites and a decrease in rental occupancy of 4 compared to June 30, 2024. While we continue to focus on increasing the number of manufactured homeowners in our Core Portfolio, we also believe renting our vacant homes represents an attractive source of occupancy and an opportunity to potentially convert the renter to a new homebuyer in the future. We continue to expect there to be fluctuations in the sources of occupancy depending on local market conditions, availability of vacant sites and success with converting renters to homeowners. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2,012 occupied rental homes in our Core MH communities. 
 RV and marina base rental income in our Core Portfolio increased 1.3 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, driven primarily by an increase in Annual RV rental income. Core RV and marina base rental income from annuals represents 68.0 of total Core RV and marina base rental income and increased 6.2 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 due to an 8.3 increase in rate, offset by a 2.1 decrease in occupancy. Core seasonal and transient RV and marina base rental income decreased 13.3 and 6.1 , respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 due to loss of occupancy from Hurricane Ian workers at our Florida properties and returning competitor supply, weather disruptions in the Northeast and normalized demand following the COVID pandemic. 
 We closed 174 new home sales during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 285 new home sales during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 38.9 . The decrease in new home sales during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the Florida and Arizona markets, where we had fewer sales locations than the same period in 2023. 
 Our gross investment in real estate increased 149.6 million to 7,855.9 million as of September 30, 2024 from 7,706.3 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to capital improvements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The following chart lists the Properties acquired from January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 and Sites added through expansion opportunities at our existing Properties:

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain Non-GAAP financial measures that in management s view of the business are meaningful as they allow investors the ability to understand key operating details of our business both with and without regard to certain accounting conventions or items that may not always be indicative of recurring annual cash flows of the portfolio. These Non-GAAP financial measures as determined and presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, and include income from property operations and Core Portfolio, FFO and Normalized FFO. 
 We believe investors should review Income from property operations and Core Portfolio, FFO and Normalized FFO, along with GAAP net income and cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, when evaluating an equity REIT s operating performance. A discussion of Income from property operations and Core Portfolio, FFO and Normalized FFO, and a reconciliation to net income are included below. 
 22 

Management's Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

 Income from Property Operations and Core Portfolio 
 We use income from property operations, income from property operations, excluding property management, and Core Portfolio income from property operations, excluding property management, as alternative measures to evaluate the operating results of our Properties. Income from property operations represents rental income, membership subscriptions and upgrade sales, utility and other income less property and rental home operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, membership sales and marketing expenses and property management expenses. Income from property operations, excluding property management, represents income from property operations excluding property management expenses. Property management represents the expenses associated with indirect costs such as off-site payroll and certain administrative and professional expenses. We believe exclusion of property management expenses is helpful to investors and analysts as a measure of the operating results of our properties, excluding items that are not directly related to the operation of the properties. For comparative purposes, we present bad debt expense within Property operating and maintenance in the current and prior periods. We believe that this Non-GAAP financial measure is helpful to investors and analysts as a measure of the operating results of our properties. 
 Our Core Portfolio consists of our Properties owned and operated during all of 2023 and 2024. Core Portfolio income from property operations, excluding property management, is useful to investors for annual comparison as it removes the fluctuations associated with acquisitions, dispositions and significant transactions or unique situations. Our Non-Core Portfolio includes all Properties that were not owned and operated during all of 2023 and 2024, including six properties in Florida impacted by Hurricane Ian and two properties in California that were impacted by storm and flooding events. 
 FFO and Normalized FFO 
 We define FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of properties, depreciation and amortization related to real estate, impairment charges and adjustments to reflect our share of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We compute FFO in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. 
 We believe FFO, as defined by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, is generally a measure of performance for an equity REIT. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity REITs, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance. 
 We define Normalized FFO as FFO excluding non-operating income and expense items, such as gains and losses from early debt extinguishment, including prepayment penalties, defeasance costs, transaction/pursuit costs and other, and other miscellaneous non-comparable items. Normalized FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to Normalized FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same methodology for computing this amount. 
 We believe that FFO and Normalized FFO are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the performance of an equity REIT. We believe that by excluding the effect of gains or losses from sales of properties, depreciation and amortization related to real estate and impairment charges, which are based on historical costs and may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. We further believe that Normalized FFO provides useful information to investors, analysts and our management because it allows them to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences not related to our normal operations. For example, we believe that excluding the early extinguishment of debt and other miscellaneous non-comparable items from FFO allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the sustainability of operating performance in future periods because these costs do not affect the future operations of the properties. In some cases, we provide information about identified non-cash components of FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items. 
 Our definitions and calculations of these Non-GAAP financial and operating measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These Non-GAAP financial and operating measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor do they represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.

 Total portfolio income from property operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased 7.5 million, or 4.5 , from the quarter ended September 30, 2023, driven by an increase of 10.3 million, or 6.3 , from our Core Portfolio, offset by a decrease of 2.8 million from our Non-Core Portfolio. The increase in income from property operations from our Core Portfolio was primarily due to higher property operating revenues, primarily in MH base rental income, RV and marina base rental income and utility and other income, partially offset by an increase in property operating and maintenance expenses and real estate taxes.

Management's Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

 Property Operating Revenues 
 MH base rental income in our Core Portfolio for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 10.3 million, or 6.2 , from the same period in 2023, which reflects 5.8 growth from rate increases and 0.4 from occupancy gains. The average monthly base rental income per Site in our Core Portfolio increased to approximately 861 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 813 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The average occupancy for our Core Portfolio was 95.0 and 94.9 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 RV and marina base rental income is comprised of the following: 
 Core Portfolio Total Portfolio Quarters Ended September 30, Quarters Ended September 30, (amounts in thousands) 2024 2023 Variance Change 2024 2023 Variance Change Annual 75,435 71,036 4,399 6.2 77,548 74,125 3,423 4.6 Seasonal 7,163 8,261 (1,098) (13.3) 7,347 8,462 (1,115) (13.2) Transient 28,321 30,176 (1,855) (6.1) 28,462 30,232 (1,770) (5.9) RV and marina base rental income 110,919 109,473 1,446 1.3 113,357 112,819 538 0.5 
 RV and marina base rental income in our Core Portfolio for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.4 million, or 1.3 , from the same period in 2023, driven primarily by an increase in Annual RV and marina base rental income. The increase in Annual RV and marina base rental income of 6.2 was partially offset by decreases in Seasonal and Transient RV and marina base rental income of 13.3 and 6.1 , respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Utility and other income in our Core Portfolio for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.8 million, or 8.8 , from the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 2.0 million and 0.8 million increase in utility income and pass-through income, respectively. The utility recovery rate (utility income divided by utility expenses) for 2024 and 2023 was approximately 47 and 43 , respectively. 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 Property operating expenses, excluding property management, in our Core Portfolio for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 4.2 million, or 2.8 , from the same period in 2023, driven by increases in property operating and maintenance expenses of 2.0 million and real estate taxes of 1.8 million. Core property operating and maintenance expenses were higher in 2024, primarily due to an increase in insurance of 1.3 million and utility expense of 0.7 million. The increase in insurance of 1.3 million is due to higher insurance premiums following our property and casualty insurance renewal in the second quarter of 2024. Real estate taxes were higher in 2024, primarily in the Florida portfolio, driven by higher real estate tax assessments in 2023.

 Home Sales and Other 
 The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for our Home Sales and Other Operations: 
 Quarters Ended September 30, (amounts in thousands, except home sales volumes) 2024 2023 Variance Change Gross revenues from new home sales 15,500 27,684 (12,184) (44.0) Cost of new home sales 13,655 24,068 (10,413) (43.3) Gross revenues from used home sales 883 1,020 (137) (13.4) Cost of used home sales 685 932 (247) (26.5) Gross revenue from brokered resales and ancillary services 14,456 16,091 (1,635) (10.2) Cost of brokered resales and ancillary services 7,711 8,471 (760) (9.0) Home selling and ancillary operating expenses 7,336 7,164 172 2.4 Home sales volumes New home sales 174 285 (111) (38.9) Used home sales 60 84 (24) (28.6) Brokered home resales 135 160 (25) (15.6) 
 Gross revenues from new home sales decreased 12.2 million and Cost of new home sales decreased 10.4 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower sales volume and lower average cost of home sales.

 Total other income and expenses, net increased 2.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher interest and related amortization as a result of an increase in interest rates, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. 
 Casualty-related charges/(recoveries), net 
 During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we recognized expenses of approximately 2.3 million and 1.8 million, respectively, related to debris removal and cleanup costs related to Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Helene. We recognized an offsetting insurance recovery revenue accrual for Hurricane Ian of 1.3 million and 1.8 million during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, related to the expected insurance recovery. During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we also recognized insurance recovery revenue in excess of expenses and business interruption proceeds for Hurricane Ian of approximately 0.5 million and zero, respectively, within Casualty-related charges/(recoveries), net. The debris and cleanup costs and offsetting recovery accrual and reimbursement of capital expenditures are reflected in Casualty-related charges/(recoveries), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 
 Loss on sale of real estate and impairment, net 
 Loss on sale of real estate and impairment, net was 0.8 million higher during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a write down of certain assets of 1.8 million as a result of Hurricane Helene, compared to 0.9 million related to storm events in 2023. 
 Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures 
 Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures was 5.2 million higher during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a distribution from an unconsolidated joint venture that refinanced a secured loan and distributed proceeds, of which 5.1 million exceeded our basis in the joint venture.

 RV and marina base rental income in our Core Portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 9.7 million, or 3.0 , from the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in Annual RV and marina base rental income, partially offset by a decrease in Seasonal and Transient RV base rental income. The increase in Annual RV and marina base rental income was 14.4 million, or 6.9 . The decrease in Seasonal RV and marina base rental income was 2.0 million, or 4.4 . The decrease in Transient RV and marina base rental income was 2.8 million, or 4.3 . 
 Utility and other income in our Core Portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.4 million, or 7.1 , from the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in utility income and pass-through income. The utility recovery rate (utility income divided by utility expenses) for 2024 and 2023 was approximately 47 and 45 , respectively. The increase in pass-through income was due to increases in real estate tax pass-throughs to customers in Florida. 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 Property operating expenses, excluding property management, in our Core Portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14.4 million, or 3.4 , from the same period in 2023, driven by increases in property operating and maintenance expenses of 6.6 million and real estate taxes of 5.6 million. Core property operating and maintenance expenses were higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in insurance of 3.8 million and higher utility expenses of 2.5 million. The increase in insurance was due to higher insurance premiums following our property and casualty insurance renewal in the second quarter of 2024. The real estate taxes were driven by higher real estate assessments in our Florida portfolio in 2023.

 Total other income and expenses, net decreased 1.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower general and administrative expense primarily as a result of accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation expense in 2023 partially offset by higher interest and related amortization as a result of higher interest rates. 
 Casualty-related charges/(recoveries), net 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we recognized expenses of approximately 3.5 million and 12.1 million, respectively, related to debris removal and cleanup costs related to Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Helene. We recognized an offsetting insurance recovery revenue accrual for Hurricane Ian of 2.5 million and 12.1 million, respectively, related to the expected insurance recovery. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we also recognized insurance recovery revenue in excess of expenses and business interruption proceeds for Hurricane Ian of approximately 21.5 million and zero, respectively, within Casualty-related charges/(recoveries), net. The debris and cleanup costs and offsetting recovery accrual and reimbursement of capital expenditures are reflected in Casualty-related charges/(recoveries), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

 Loss on sale of real estate and impairment, net 
 Loss on sale of real estate and impairment, net was 1.8 million lower during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a higher write down of 3.6 million in 2023 related to flooding events at certain properties in California and Florida compared to Hurricane Helene in 2024 of 1.8 million. 
 Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures 
 Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures was 4.6 million higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a distribution from an unconsolidated joint venture which refinanced a secured loan and distributed proceeds of which 5.1 million exceeded our basis in the joint venture.

Management's Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Our primary demands for liquidity include payment of operating expenses, dividend distributions, debt service, including principal and interest, capital improvements on Properties, home purchases and property acquisitions. We expect similar demand for liquidity will continue for the short-term and long-term. Our primary sources of cash include operating cash flows, proceeds from financings, borrowings under our unsecured line of credit (the LOC and proceeds from issuance of equity and debt securities, including issuances under our ATM equity offering program (as defined below). 
 One of our stated objectives is to maintain financial flexibility. Achieving this objective allows us to take advantage of strategic opportunities that may arise. When investing capital, we consider all potential uses, including returning capital to our stockholders or the conditions under which we may repurchase our stock. These conditions include, but are not limited to, market price, balance sheet flexibility, alternative opportunistic capital uses and capital requirements. We believe effective management of our balance sheet, including maintaining various access points to raise capital, managing future debt maturities and borrowing at competitive rates, enables us to meet this objective. Accessing long-term low-cost secured debt continues to be our focus. 
 On February 28, 2024, we entered into a new at-the-market ATM equity offering program, pursuant to which we may sell, from time-to-time, shares of our common stock, par value 0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to 500.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the full capacity of our ATM equity offering program remained available for issuance. In October 2024, we sold approximately 4.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of 70.00 from our at-the-market ATM offering program. See Note 14. Subsequent Events for additional information. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had available liquidity in the form of approximately 413.5 million shares of authorized and unissued common stock, par value 0.01 per share, and 10.0 million shares of authorized and unissued preferred stock registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We anticipate entering into a new at-the-market ATM equity offering program within the near future, pursuant to which we may sell, from time-to-time, shares of our common stock, par value 0.01 per share, with an aggregate offering price capacity of at least 500.0 million. 
 We also utilize interest rate swaps to add stability to our interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The changes in the fair value of the designated derivative are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassified into earnings on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. For additional information regarding our interest rate swaps, see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements Note 9. Derivative Instruments and Hedging . 
 We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including principal payments, capital improvements and dividend distributions for the next twelve months, generally through available cash, net cash provided by operating activities, issuances of equity under our ATM equity offering program and our LOC. As of September 30, 2024, our LOC had a borrowing capacity of 467.4 million. 
 We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements, using long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including the existing LOC and the issuance of debt securities or the issuance of equity including under our ATM equity offering program. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows activity: 
 For the nine months ended September 30, (amounts in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 491,404 418,658 Net cash used in investing activities (151,906) (237,519) Net cash used in financing activities (329,037) (143,806) Net increase in cash and restricted cash 10,461 37,333 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 72.7 million to 491.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 418.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net increases in manufactured homes, net and accounts payable and other liabilities.

Management's Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

 The following table summarizes our purchase and sale activity of manufactured homes: 
 For the nine months ended September 30, (amounts in thousands) 
 2024 2023 Purchase of manufactured homes (36,003) (90,477) Sale of manufactured homes 47,382 58,497 Manufactured homes, net 11,379 (31,980) 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased 85.6 million to 151.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 237.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a decrease in capital expenditures of 55.5 million, an increase of 13.6 million in Hurricane Ian proceeds in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and an increase in distributions of capital from unconsolidated joint ventures of 10.4 million. 
 Capital Improvements 
 The following table summarizes capital improvements: 
 For the nine months ended September 30, (amounts in thousands) 2024 2023 Asset preservation (1) 
 33,086 41,246 Improvements and renovations (2) 
 22,728 29,505 Property upgrades and development (3) 
 103,711 132,310 Site development (4) 
 9,838 22,596 Total property improvements 169,363 225,657 Corporate 6,266 5,515 Total capital improvements 175,629 231,172 
 ______________________ 
 (1) Includes upkeep of property infrastructure including utilities and streets and replacement of community equipment and vehicles. 
 (2) Includes enhancements to amenities such as buildings, common areas, swimming pools and replacement of furniture and site amenities. 
 (3) Includes 12.3 million of restoration and improvement capital expenditures related to Hurricane Ian for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 (4) Includes capital expenditures to improve the infrastructure required to set manufactured homes. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased 185.2 million to 329.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 143.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage note financing proceeds of 463.8 million and an increase in distributions to common stockholders of 18.5 million, partially offset by a lower line of credit, net repayment of 199.5 million and lower principal payments and mortgage debt repayment of 100.8 million. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Significant ongoing contractual obligations consist primarily of long-term borrowings, interest expense, operating leases, LOC maintenance fees and ground leases. For a summary and complete presentation and description of our ongoing commitments and contractual obligations, see Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Refer to Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of our critical accounting policies.
