Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for the Company s financial instruments, are made solely to comply with the requirements of the Financial Instruments Topic and should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and related notes. The Company determines the estimated fair value amounts by using market information and valuation methodologies that it considers appropriate and consistent with the fair value accounting guidance.

Non-recourse debt The fair value of the Company s non-recourse debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

Overview ATEL 16, LLC (the Company or the Fund was formed under the laws of the state of California on December 27, 2012 for the purpose of raising capital and originating equipment financing transactions and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities. The offering of the Company was granted effectiveness by the Securities and Exchange Commission as of November 5, 2013. Through September 30, 2024, cumulative gross contributions, less rescissions and repurchases (net of distributions paid and allocated syndication costs, as applicable) totaling 42.8 million (inclusive of the 500 initial Member s capital investment), had been received. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 4,269,656 Units were issue d and outstanding . Results of Operations Three months ended September 30 , 2024 versus three months ended September 30 , 2023 The Company had net income of 24 thousand and a net loss of 44 thousand for the respective three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Compared to the prior year quarter, the results for the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflect a decrease in total operating expenses and a favorable change in other gains and losses related to the fair valuation of the Fund s equity securities and warrants offset, in part, by a decline in total operating revenues. Revenues Total operating revenues decreased by 32 thousand, or 6 , primarily due to a 37 thousand decrease in operating lease revenues partially offset by a 5 thousand increase in other income. The decrease in operating lease revenues was mostly related to a 37 thousand decline in revenues from leases under month-to-month contracts. Offsetting such decrease in revenues was a 5 thousand gain in other income related to interest earned on certain cash deposits. Expenses Total operating expenses decreased by 84 thousand, or 14 , primarily due to decreases in professional fees and depreciation expense offset, in part, by increases in cost reimbursements and other expense. Professional fees decreased by 59 thousand due to lower audit and tax preparation fees attributable to timing differences in receipt of services and billings, and depreciation expense decreased by 58 thousand due to lease run-off and dispositions since September 30, 2023. These decreases in expenses were partially offset by an 18 thousand increase in cost reimbursements to the Managing Member, which was attributable to allocated severance related payments, and an 18 thousand increase in other expense, which was primarily a result of increased bank charges.

 Other income During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded other income totaling 4 thousand and other loss totaling 12 thousand, respectively, to reflect unrealized gains and losses on the fair valuation of the Fund s investment securities and warrants portfolio. Other income recorded during the current period all relates to unrealized gains on the Fund s warrant positions. In contrast, the prior year period other loss reflects an 8 thousand unrealized loss related to the Fund s equity securities and 4 thousand of unrealized losses related to its warrant positions, both due to adverse changes in prices of the underlying securities. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus nine months ended September 30, 2023 The Company had net losses of 46 thousand and 138 thousand for the respective nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Compared to the prior year period, the results for the first nine months of 2024 reflect a decrease in total operating expenses and a favorable change in other gains and losses related to the fair valuation of the Fund s equity securities and warrants offset, in part, by a decline in total operating revenues. Revenues Total operating revenues decreased by 54 thousand, or 3 , primarily due to a 44 thousand decrease in operating lease income and a 10 thousand reduction in other income. The decline in operating lease income was related to a 37 thousand reduction in revenues from leases under month-to-month contracts coupled with a 7 thousand increase in provision for doubtful accounts. The decline in other income was mostly related to a reduction in interest income earned on certain cash deposits. Expenses Total operating expenses decreased by 127 thousand, or 7 , primarily due to decreases in depreciation expense and interest expense. This was offset by increases in other expense and taxes on income and franchise fees. Depreciation expense decreased by 151 thousand primarily due to portfolio run-off. Such decrease was net of a 40 thousand increase in additional depreciation recorded to reflect year-to-date changes in the estimated residual value of certain equipment generating revenue under month-to-month extensions. Interest expense decreased by due to the scheduled amortization of the Company s notes payable. In addition, other expense increased by 22 thousand due to increases in bank charges and miscellaneous pass-through related costs. Taxes on income and franchise taxes increased by 9 thousand, mainly due to prior year related penalties paid. Other income During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded other income totaling 3 thousand and other loss totaling 16 thousand, respectively, to reflect unrealized gains and losses on the fair valuation of the Fund s investment securities and warrants portfolio. Other income recorded during the current period all relates to unrealized gains on the Fund s warrant positions. By comparison, the prior year period other loss reflects a 10 thousand of unrealized loss related to the Fund s equity securities and 6 thousand of unrealized losses related to its warrant positions, both due to adverse changes in prices of the underlying securities. Capital Resources and Liquidity The Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled 1.6 million and 3.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and decreasing as lease assets are acquired, as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases.

 The Company currently believes it has available adequate reserves to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements. The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes. Cash Flows The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 886 987 Investing activities 22 Financing activities (2,499) (2,511) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (1,591) (1,524) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s main source of liquidity was cash flows from its portfolio of operating lease contracts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 22 thousand of proceeds from the sale of lease assets. There were no such sales during the prior year period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash was primarily used to pay distributions and repay borrowings under non-recourse debt. Cash used to pay distributions totaled 2.2 million for each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Repayments of non-recourse debt totaled 250 thousand and 256 thousand for the same respective periods. Units repurchased amounted to 7 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11 thousand for the prior year nine-month period. In addition, cash was also used to pay invoices related to management fees and expenses, and other payables for both nine-month periods. Distributions The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement. The Company commenced periodic distributions beginning with the month of April 2014. Additional distributions have been made through September 30, 2024. Cash distributions were paid by the Fund to Unitholders of record as of August 31, 2024, and paid through September 30, 2024. The distributions may be characterized for tax, accounting and economic purposes as a return of capital, a return on capital (including escrow interest) or a portion of each. Generally, the portion of each cash distribution by a company which exceeds its net income for the fiscal period would constitute a return of capital. The Fund is required by the terms of its Operating Agreement to distribute the net cash flow generated by its investments in certain minimum amounts during the Reinvestment Period before it can reinvest its operating cash flow in additional portfolio assets. See the discussion in the ATEL 16, LLC Prospectus dated November 5, 2013 Prospectus under Income, Losses and Distributions. Accordingly, the amount of cash flow from Fund investments distributed to Unitholders will not be available for reinvestment in additional portfolio assets. The cash distributions were based on current and anticipated gross revenues from the leases, loans and equity investments acquired. During the Fund s acquisition and operating stages, the Fund may incur short term borrowing to fund regular distributions of such gross revenues to be generated by newly acquired transactions during their respective initial fixed terms. As such, all Fund periodic cash distributions made during these stages have been, and are expected in the future to be, based on the Fund s actual and anticipated gross revenues to be generated from the binding initial terms of the leases, loans and investments acquired.

On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based upon historical experiences, market trends and financial forecasts, and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time.

There have been no material changes to the Company s significant accounting policies since December 31, 2023. Item 4. Controls and procedures.

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control There were no changes in the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company.
