 interest in its Livengood Gold Project in Alaska, U.S.A (the Livengood Gold Project ). These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which presumes the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As at September 30, 2024 , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of compared to as at December 31, 2023. The Company has no revenue generating operations from which it can internally generate funds. The Company will require significant additional financing to continue its operations (including general and administrative expenses) in connection with advancing activities at the Livengood Gold Project and the development of any mine that may be built at the Livengood Gold Project. There is no assurance that the Company will make a decision to build a mine at the Livengood Gold Project and, if so, that it will be able to obtain the additional financing required on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, any significant delays in the issuance of required permits for the ongoing work at the Livengood Gold Project, or unexpected results in connection with the ongoing work, could result in the Company being required to raise additional funds to advance permitting efforts. The Company s review of its financing options in respect of the Livengood Gold Project includes considering a future strategic alliance to assist in further development, permitting and future construction costs, although there can be no assurance that any such strategic alliance will, in fact, be pursued or realized. Despite the Company s success to date in raising significant equity financing to fund its operations, there is significant uncertainty that the Company will be able to secure any additional financing in the current or future equity markets. The amount of funds to be raised and the terms of any proposed equity financing that may be undertaken will be negotiated by management as opportunities to raise funds arise. Specific plans related to the use of proceeds will be devised once financing has been completed and management knows what funds will be available for these purposes. As at November 6, 2024, management believes that the Company will need to secure additional financing in order to have sufficient financial resources to maintain its operations for the next twelve months. As a result, there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 The Company had a net loss of 667,302 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 710,351 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding share-based costs of 1,096 and 67,128 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, consulting fees were 60,413 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 64,159 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 3,746 is primarily due to decreased consulting services. Professional fees were 57,398 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 104,196 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 46,798 was primarily due to decreased legal services of 39,098 and timing variances for audit services for an increase of 14,348 and tax services for a decrease of 22,048. Regulatory expenses were 59,478 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 71,940 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 12,462 is primarily due to expenses related to the preparation and filing of a shelf registration during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Travel expenses were 16,407 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 27,616 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 11,209 is primarily due to decreased travel. Office expenses were 4,882 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 13,318 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 8,436 is primarily due to lower hardware replacements and supplies. Mineral property expenditures were 119,401 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 105,479 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 13,922 was primarily due to decreased land-related legal fees of 10,878, increased fees for Bureau of Land Management of 2,141, and timing variance for environmental baseline activities for an increase of 22,659. Excluding share-based payments, all other operating expense categories reflected only moderate changes period over period. Share-based payment charges Share-based payment charges for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were allocated as follows: 

Expense category: September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Consulting 1,096 67,128 Investor relations 1,096 877 Wages and benefits 15,344 12,288 Total 17,536 80,293 Share-based payment charges were 17,536 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 80,293 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 62,757 was mainly the result of the DSUs issued on July 12, 2023 being expensed for a decrease of 66,251 and stock options for common shares of the Company issued to its employees and consultants vesting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for an increase of 3,494. Other items amounted to total other expense of 6,961 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to total other income of 70,607 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. As a result of the impact of exchange rates on certain of the Company s U.S. dollar cash balances, the Company had a foreign exchange loss of 22,473 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gain of 46,691 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The average exchange rate during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was C 1 to 0.7332, compared to C 1 to 0.7457 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Interest income was 15,512 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 23,916 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023.

The increase of 114,353 was primarily due to prior year-end payroll accruals reversing of 82,867 and to the timing of payroll benefits of 31,486. Travel expenses were 29,104 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 41,490 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 12,386 is primarily due to reduced actual travel. Professional fees were 176,294 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 232,077 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 55,783 was primarily due to decreased legal services of 58,776 and timing variances for accounting and tax services for an increase of 16,434, XBRL services for an increase of 1,531, and audit services for a decrease of 14,972. Excluding share-based payments, all other operating expense categories reflected only moderate changes period over period. Share-based payment charges Share-based payment charges for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were allocated as follows: 

Expense category: September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Consulting 298,469 328,651 Investor relations 5,227 4,847 Wages and benefits 73,173 67,862 Total 376,869 401,360 Share-based payment charges were 376,869 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 401,360 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The average exchange rate during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was C 1 to 0.7351, compared to C 1 to 0.7432 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Interest income was 72,886 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 79,737 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 6,851 was primarily due to short-term investment certificates being re-invested upon maturity at a lower interest rate. Other income was Nil for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10,480 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has no revenue generating operations from which it can internally generate funds.

 As at September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 1,746,231 compared to 1,687,690 at December 31, 2023. The increase of approximately 0.1 million resulted mainly from net financing activities of 2.3 million partially offset by operating activities of 2.2 million. Financing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 included the Private Placement, pursuant to which the Company issued 3,807,911 common shares to existing major shareholders to raise gross proceeds of approximately 2.5 million. Financing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 included share issuance costs of 50,661 related to the preparation of a new Registration Statement on Form S-3. The Company had no cash flows from investing activities during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. As at September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of 1,747,399 compared to working capital of 1,757,465 at December 31, 2023. The Company expects that it will operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, but believes the current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to cover the anticipated 2024 work plan at the Livengood Gold Project and that additional financing will be required to satisfy its currently anticipated general and administrative costs through at least the next 12 months. The Company will require significant additional financing to continue its operations (including general and administrative expenses) in connection with advancing activities at the Livengood Gold Project and the development of any mine that may be built at the Livengood Gold Project, and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional financing required on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, any significant delays in the issuance of required permits for the ongoing work at the Livengood Gold Project, or unexpected results in connection with the ongoing work, could result in the Company being required to raise additional funds to advance permitting efforts. The Company s review of its financing options includes considering a future strategic alliance to assist in further development, permitting and future construction costs, although there can be no assurance that any such strategic alliance will, in fact, be pursued or realized. Despite the Company s success to date in raising significant equity financing to fund its operations, there is significant uncertainty that the Company will be able to secure any additional financing in the current or future equity markets. See Risk Factors We will require additional financing to fund exploration and, if warranted, development and production. Failure to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation and could cast uncertainty on our ability to continue as a going concern included in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other than cash held by its subsidiaries for their immediate operating needs in the United States, all of the Company s cash reserves are on deposit with a major Canadian chartered bank. The Company does not believe that the credit, liquidity or market risks with respect thereto have increased as a result of current market conditions. Our anticipated expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2024 are approximately 3.3 million, which are expected to be funded from cash on hand. These expenditures include 0.7 million for mineral property leases and mining claim government fees and 2.6 million for general corporate and administrative purposes. Expenditures for mineral property leases and mining claims government fees are anticipated to be approximately 0.8 million in 2025 and 0.8 million in 2026. See Note 8 to the Company s condensed consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information regarding the Company s known contractual obligations.

 Critical Accounting Estimates For a discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that the Company s management has identified as critical in the preparation of the Company s financial statements, please see Critical Accounting Estimates under Part II. Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in the Company s critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Environmental Regulations The operations of the Company may in the future be affected from time to time in varying degrees by changes in environmental regulations, including those for future removal and site restoration costs. Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon the Company vary greatly and are not predictable. The Company s policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of technically proven and economically feasible measures. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders The Company believes that it has been a passive foreign investment company PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in recent years and expects to continue to be a PFIC in the future. Current and prospective U.S. shareholders should consult with their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of PFIC classification and the U.S. federal tax treatment of PFICs. Additional information on this matter is included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under Part II. Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not applicable. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act: (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system will be met and is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgement in designing, implementing and evaluating controls and procedures and the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under the heading Risk Factors. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Not applicable. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES Not applicable. ITEM 4.

During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company and its subsidiaries were not subject to regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
