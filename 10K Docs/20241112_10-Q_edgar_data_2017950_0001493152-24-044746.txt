Business
Combination 

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering
and sale of the Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating
a Business Combination. Nasdaq rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have
a fair market value equal to at least of the balance in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable
on interest earned) at the time of the signing of an agreement to enter into a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a
Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the
target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

The
Company will provide its shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of a
Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means
of a tender offer. In connection with an initial Business Combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination
at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against
a Business Combination. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the
tender offer rules, the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a public shareholder,
together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group 
(as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted
from seeking redemption rights with respect to or more of the public shares without the Company s prior written consent. 

If
a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the
Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender
offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the
same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 

The
shareholders will be entitled to redeem their public shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account
(initially per public share,
plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax
obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to shareholders who redeem their public shares will not be reduced by the
deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed in Note 7). There will be no redemption
rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s rights. The ordinary shares will be
recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity . 

The
Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted
are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder
vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association,
offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same
information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.

 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The
Sponsor and any of the Company s officers or directors that may hold Founder Shares (as described in Note 5) (as defined the initial
shareholders are identical to the ordinary shares included in the units being sold in this offering except that the founder shares
are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below: the sponsor, officers and directors have entered into
a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares,
private placement shares and public shares in connection with the completion of the initial business combination, (ii) to waive their
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares, private placement shares and public shares held by them in connection with a shareholder
vote to approve an amendment to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing
of obligation to provide for the redemption of public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem of
public shares if the Company have not consummated the initial business combination within the timeframe set forth therein or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) to waive
their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares and private placement shares if
the Company fail to complete the initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering (although they will
be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if the Company fail to complete
the initial business combination within the prescribed time frame). 

The
Company will have until October 26, 2025 initially to consummate a Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipates that it
may not be able to consummate a Business Combination within 15 months, if we seek shareholder approval for an extension, our public shareholders
will be offered an opportunity to redeem their shares at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares,
subject to applicable laws. 

If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except
for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem of
the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account,
including interest earned (net of taxes payable), which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders
(including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors,
proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations
to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. The underwriters have agreed to waive its rights to the deferred
underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination
Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the
redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available
for distribution will be less than . 

The
Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce
the amounts in the Trust Account to below per share (whether or not the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised
in full), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and
except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Proposed Public Offering against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event
that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any
liability for such third party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust
Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities
with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in
or to monies held in the Trust Account.

Going
Concern Consideration 

The
Company initially has 15 months from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering to consummate the initial Business Combination.
If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within 15 months from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company
will trigger an automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles
of Association. As a result, this has the same effect as if the Company had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under
the Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a
voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation. However, the Company may extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination.
If the Company is unable to consummate the Company s initial Business Combination by October 26, 2025 (unless further extended),
the Company will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem of the Company s outstanding
public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the
funds held in the Trust Account and not necessary to pay taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, the Company may not
be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of the Company s
public shareholders. In the event of dissolution and liquidation, the Company s rights will expire and will be worthless. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined
that if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time from the closing
of the IPO, the requirement that the Company cease all operations, redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve raises
substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management has determined that the Company has funds that are sufficient to fund the working
capital needs of the Company until the consummation of an initial business combination or the winding up of the Company as stipulated
in the Company s amended and restated memorandum of association. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), which contemplate continuation
of the Company as a going concern.

of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. 

The
Company may be subject to potential examination by foreign taxing authorities in the area of income taxes. These potential examinations
may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with
foreign tax laws. The Company s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change
over the next twelve months.

believe it would have a material effect on the Company, and will continue to evaluate its impact.

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include: 

Level
 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in
 which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing
 basis. 

Level
 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets
 or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 

Level
 3 - Unobservable inputs based on the Company s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
 the asset or liability. 

- 
 - 

As
of September 30, 2023, the Company did not have any assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Public Units, which includes Public Units
upon the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option, at a purchase price of per Public Unit. 

All
of the public shares sold as part of the Public Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows
for the redemption of such public shares if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and
in connection with certain amendments to the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, or in connection
with the Company s liquidation. In accordance with the SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which
has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject
to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. 

The
Company s redeemable ordinary share is subject to SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has
been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either
accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the
instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption
value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting
period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The accretion or remeasurement is treated as a deemed dividend
(i.e., a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital).

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on November 29, 2022 as an exempted company with limited liability. We were
formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or
similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a target business. We are an
emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. 

On
July 26, 2024, we consummated the initial public offering of 6,900,000 units Units ), which includes the exercise in full
by the underwriters of their over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 Units on July 25, 2024. Each Unit consists
of one ordinary share, par value 0.0001 per share Ordinary Share ), and one right Right to receive one-ninth
(1/9) of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00
per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 69,000,000. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners A.G.P. served as the representative
of the underwriters of our initial public offering. 

16 

Simultaneously
with the closing of our initial public offering on July 26, 2024, we consummated the private placement with DT Cloud Star Management
Limited, the sponsor Sponsor ), of 206,900 private units at a price of 10.00 per private unit, generating total gross
proceeds of 2,069,000. As of July 26, 2024, a total of 69,000,000 of the net proceeds from our initial public offering were deposited
in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders, with Wilmington Trust National Association acting as trustee. 

Our
Units started to be listed on The Nasdaq Global Market (the Nasdaq and began trading under the ticker symbol DTSQU 
on July 25, 2024. On September 12, 2024, we announced that the holders of the Units may elect to separately trade the underlying component
securities of the Units commencing on September 16, 2024. Those Units not separated continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol DTSQU, 
and each of the Ordinary Shares and Rights that have been separated trade on Nasdaq under the symbols DTSQ and DTSQR, 
respectively. 

Our
efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location. Our management
team is actively seeking out potential opportunities to pursue a business combination. Completion of an initial business combination
is subject to, among other things, the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement providing for the transaction, satisfaction
of the closing conditions included therein and approval of the transaction by our shareholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
that a definitive agreement will be entered into or that the proposed transaction will be consummated in the near term. Nevertheless,
we are confident that we will be able to find a target business that will meet expectations. We intend to capitalize on the strengths
and experiences of our management team to select, acquire and form a business combination that has a competitive advantage in their core
business and is positioned to bring in high returns and long-term sustainable growth. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
July 26, 2024, we consummated the initial public offering of 6,900,000 Units, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters
of their over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 Units on July 25, 2024. The Units were sold at an offering price
of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 69,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering on July
26, 2024, we consummated the private placement with the Sponsor of 206,900 private units at a price of 10.00 per private unit, generating
total gross proceeds of 2,069,000. 

Following
our initial public offering and the private placement, a total of 69,000,000 of the net proceeds were deposited in the trust account.
We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the
trust account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and less taxes payable) to complete our initial business combination. We may
withdraw interest from the trust account to pay our taxes. To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration
to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance
the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. We intend to use the funds
held outside the trust account primarily for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing business due diligence
on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses, reviewing
corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, selecting the target business to acquire and structuring,
negotiating and consummating the business combination. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used by operating activities was 163,331, primarily due to prepayment of formation and
operational costs. Net cash used in investing activates was 69,000,000 to invest the cash in a trust account established for the benefit
of our public stockholders, with Wilmington Trust National Association acting as trustee. Net cash provided by financing activities was
 69,608,181, primarily due to the consummation the IPO of 6,900,000 units at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 69,000,000
and the proceeds from sale of units to the founder in private placement generating total gross proceeds of 2,069,000. Offering cost
amounted to 1,485,819, consisting of 1,035,000 of underwriting commissions and 450,819 of other offering costs. As of September 30,
2024, we had cash at bank of 444,850. 

On
September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of 427,054 excluding deferred underwriting commissions and including the available
cash held in the Trust Account for marketable securities, which indicated a lack of liquidity it needed to sustain operations
for a reasonable period of time, which was considered to be one year from the issuance of the financial statements. 

17 

On
October 28, 2024, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal
amount of 300,000 (the Promissory Note ). The Promissory Note is non-interest-bearing, and the principal under the Promissory
Note is payable on the date which we consummate an initial business combination. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business combination, our sponsor,
officers, directors, or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required Working Capital Loan ).
If we complete our initial business combination, we will repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds
from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 300,000 of such loans may be convertible upon consummation of the initial
business combination into private units at a price of 10.00 per unit. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, no Working Capital Loan
has been granted. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Our entire activity since inception through September 30, 2024
related to our formation, the preparation for the initial public offering, and since the closing of the initial public offering, the
search for a prospective initial business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until the closing and completion
of our initial business combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the amount
held in the trust account. We expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial
reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with search for, and completing,
a business combination. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 526,781, which consisted of operating costs of 127,361, offset by
interest and dividends earned on marketable securities held in the operating account and Trust Account of 654,142. For the three months
ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 666, which consisted of operating cost of 666. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 474,123, which consisted of operating costs of 180,019, offset by interest
and dividends earned on marketable securities held in the operating account and Trust Account of 654,142. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 1,996, which consisted of operating cost of 1,996. 

Contractual
Obligations 

Registration
Rights 

Pursuant
to a registration rights agreement entered into on July 24, 2024, the holders of the insider shares, private placement units (including
securities contained therein), and units (including securities contained therein) that may be issued on conversion of working capital
loans are entitled to certain customary registration rights for the resale of such securities. The holders of these securities are entitled
to make requests for no more than two demand registrations, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition,
the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our
completion of initial business combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under
the Securities Act. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 

18 

Underwriting
Agreement 

The
underwriters are entitled to a cash underwriting commission of 2.5 of the gross proceeds of the initial public offering upon the closing
of the initial business combination, including (1) 0.15 per Unit, or 900,000 (or 1,035,000 if the underwriters over-allotment
option is exercised in full) in the aggregate, payable to the underwriters in cash upon the consummation of the initial public offering,
and (2) 0.10 per Unit, or 600,000 (or 690,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) in the aggregate,
for deferred underwriting commissions that will be placed in the trust account as described in the Prospectus and payable to the underwriters
in cash upon the consummation of the initial business combination. In addition, we agreed to issue 60,000 Ordinary Shares (or up to 69,000
Ordinary Shares if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) (the Representative Shares to A.G.P.
upon the consummation of the initial public offering as part of the underwriting compensation in connection with this offering. On July
26, 2024 we issued 69,000 Representative Shares to A.G.P. at the closing of our initial public offering, which have been received by
A.G.P. 

Administrative
Services Agreement 

On
July 24, 2024, we entered into an agreement with the Sponsor, pursuant to which we agreed to pay the Sponsor a total of 10,000 per month
for secretarial and administrative support services provided to us through the earlier of consummation of the initial business combination
and our liquidation. 

In
addition, our Sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on
suitable business combinations. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in
connection with activities on our behalf. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from
those estimates. A critical accounting estimate to our unaudited financial statements includes the valuation of ordinary shares subject
to possible redemption. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Our
management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have
a material effect on the Company s unaudited financial statements. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

JOBS
Act 

We
qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements
based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting
standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such
standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that
comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

As
an emerging growth company , we are not required to, among other things, (1) provide an auditor s attestation report
on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (2) provide all of the compensation disclosure that
may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (3) comply
with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s
report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (4) disclose
certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of
the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion
of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded that during the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities 

In
November 2022, March 2023 and January 2024, an aggregate of 1,725,000 insider shares were issued to our initial shareholders, for an
aggregate purchase price of 25,000, or approximately 0.014 per share. The insider shares held by our initial shareholders included
an aggregate of up to 225,000 shares subject to forfeiture by our sponsor to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option
was not exercised in full or in part, so that our initial shareholders would collectively own 20.0 of our issued and outstanding shares
after our initial public offering (excluding the sale of the private units and the issuance of representative shares and assuming our
initial shareholders did not purchase units in our initial public offering). On July 25, 2024, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment
option in full. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of our initial public offering on July 26, 2024, we consummated the private placement with the Sponsor of 206,900 private
units at a price of 10.00 per private unit. This issuance was made pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, as the transaction
did not involve a public offering. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to the private placement.

26, 2024, we consummated the private placement with the Sponsor of 206,900 private units at a price of 10.00 per private unit, generating
total gross proceeds of 2,069,000. 

As
of July 26, 2024, a total of 69,000,000 of the net proceeds from our initial public offering was deposited in a trust account established
for the benefit of our public stockholders, with Wilmington Trust National Association acting as trustee. 

The
securities sold in our initial public offering were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form
S-1 (File No. 333-278982) (the Registration Statement ). The SEC declared the Registration Statement effective on July 24,
2024. 

There
has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement as described in
our Prospectus.
