 operating segment and reporting unit for goodwill impairment consideration. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company reviews goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Finite-lived intangible assets that are acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value on their acquisition dates and are amortized using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset if the pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliability determined. Finite-lived intangible assets consist of university partner relationships and trade names. The Company reviews its finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset may not be recoverable. There were no indicators that the carrying amount of the finite-lived intangible assets were impaired as of September 30, 2024. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such intangible assets are not recoverable, a potential impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amounts of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Share-Based Compensation

 - , subject to renewal options, although certain agreements may give the university partners the right to terminate early if certain conditions are met. The Company s Services Agreements have a single performance obligation, as the promises to provide the identified services are not distinct within the context of these agreements. The single performance obligation is delivered as our partners receive and consume benefits, which occurs ratably over a series of distinct service periods (daily or semester). Service revenue is recognized over time using the output method of measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of the single performance obligation. The output method provides a faithful depiction of the performance toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation and can be tied to the time elapsed which is consumed evenly over the service period and is a direct measurement of the value provided to our partners. The service fees received from our partners over the term of the agreement are variable in nature in that they are dependent upon the number of students attending the university partner s program and revenues generated from those students during the service period. Due to the variable nature of the consideration over the life of the service arrangement, the Company considered forming an expectation of the variable consideration to be received over the service life of this one performance obligation. However, since the performance obligation represents a series of distinct services, the Company recognizes the variable consideration that becomes known and billable because these fees relate to the distinct service period in which the fees are earned. The Company meets the criteria in the standard and exercises the practical expedient to not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the single performance obligation that is unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations because the directly allocable variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The service fees are calculated and settled per the terms of the Services Agreements and result in a settlement duration of less than one year for all partners. There are no refunds or return rights under the Services Agreements. The Company s receivables represent unconditional rights to consideration from our Services Agreements with our university partners. Accounts receivable, net is stated at net realizable value and contains billed and unbilled revenue. The Company utilizes the allowance method to provide for doubtful accounts based on its evaluation of the expected credit losses. There have been amounts written off and reserves established as of September 30, 2024. The Company will continue to review and revise its allowance methodology based on its collection experience with its partners. For our partners with unbilled revenue, revenue recognition occurs in advance of billings. Billings for some university partners do not occur until after the service period has commenced and final enrollment information is available. Given that the Fall semester ends on December 31 of each year unbilled revenue is low at year end (whereas a semester is ongoing at the end of each other fiscal quarter, and unbilled revenue is thus higher at the end of our first three quarters). Our unbilled revenue of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue represents the excess of amounts received as compared to amounts recognized in revenue on our consolidated statements of income as of the end of the reporting period, and such amounts are reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally receive payments for our services billed within 30 days of invoice. These payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the services are delivered and revenue is recognized.

The Company estimates the lifetime expected credit losses for all available-for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. If our assessment indicates that an expected credit loss exists, we determine the portion of the unrealized loss attributable to credit deterioration and record a reserve for the expected credit loss in the allowance for credit losses in technology and academic services in our consolidated income statements.

Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain income statement data as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated. Amortization of intangible assets has been excluded from the table below: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Costs and expenses Technology and academic services 17.6 17.7 16.5 16.9 Counseling services and support 32.4 33.3 32.2 32.2 Marketing and communication 22.9 23.9 22.0 23.0 General and administrative 6.0 5.5 4.8 4.8 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Service revenue . Our service revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 238.3 million, an increase of 16.4 million, or 7.4 , as compared to service revenue of 221.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase year over year in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in GCU enrollments to 123,002 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.0 over enrollments at September 30, 2023, an increase in university partner enrollments at our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites to 5,888 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 8.1 over enrollments at September 30, 2023, which includes 913 and 510 GCU students at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and an increase in revenue per student year over year. The increase in revenue per student between years is primarily due to s ervice revenue per student for Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing ABSN students at off-campus classroom and laboratory sites generating a significantly higher revenue per student than we earn under our agreement with GCU, as these agreements generally provide us with a higher revenue share percentage, the partners have higher tuition rates than GCU and the majority of their students take more credits on average per semester. The increase in revenue per student in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was also due to the timing of the Fall semester for the ground traditional campus. The Fall semester started two days earlier in 2024 than in 2023, which had the effect of shifting 2.2 million in service revenue from the fourth quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2024 in comparison to the prior year. Contract modifications for some of our university partners in which the revenue share percentage was reduced in exchange for us no longer reimbursing the partner for certain faculty costs and the termination of one university partner contract at the end of the Spring 2024 semester had the effect of reducing revenue per student. Partner enrollments totaled 127,977 at September 30, 2024 as compared to 123,165 at September 30, 2023. Although partner enrollments at our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites returned to year over year growth in 2024, some existing partners continue to experience reduced incoming cohort sizes which has slowed the growth. We believe the growth in the number of ABSN students is being negatively impacted by the strong job market as these students have historically been individuals with already completed bachelor s degrees choosing to re-career into one of these health professions. To address this challenge, we have been working with a number of our university partners to adjust their programs to allow students with the required education experience but without a completed bachelor s degree to enter their programs. The majority of those partners that have made the adjustment to admit students without a completed bachelor s degree had new enrollment growth on a year over year basis in the Summer and Fall 2024 semesters. We opened five sites in the year ended December 31, 2023, seven sites in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and closed one site increasing the total number of these sites to 46 at September 30, 2024, which has also positively impacted the enrollment growth. Enrollments for GCU ground students were 24,657 at September 30, 2024 down from 

 24 

Table of Contents 
 25,232 at September 30, 2023 due to a small decline in traditional ground students year over year and the continued decline in professional studies students, working adults attending the university s traditional campus at night, partially offset by an increase in ABSN students between years. GCU online enrollments were 98,345 at September 30, 2024, up from 92,995 at September 30, 2023, an increase of 5.8 between years. Technology and academic services . Our technology and academic services expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 42.0 million, an increase of 2.8 million, or 7.1 , as compared to technology and academic services expenses of 39.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in other technology and academic costs and in occupancy and depreciation of 2.4 million and 1.2 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation and related expenses, including share-based compensation of 0.8 million. The increases in other technology and academic costs and in occupancy and depreciation were primarily due to the costs associated with the increased number of off-campus classroom and laboratory sites to support our 22 university partners and their increased enrollment growth. The decrease in employee compensation and related expenses is primarily due to decreased faculty reimbursements due to changes in our agreements with certain university partners whereby we no longer reimburse these partners for their faculty costs, partially offset by increased headcount to support our 22 university partners, and their increased enrollment growth, tenure-based salary adjustments and the increased number of off-campus classroom and laboratory sites year over year. Our technology and academic services expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.1 to 17.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 17.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the decreased faculty reimbursements between years. We anticipate that technology and academic services expenses as a percentage of revenue will increase in the future as we open more off-site classroom and laboratory sites although these increases might be offset by lower faculty reimbursements if more partners choose to adjust their contracts. Counseling services and support . Our counseling services and support expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 77.2 million, an increase of 3.4 million, or 4.5 , as compared to counseling services and support expenses of 73.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and related expenses including share-based compensation and benefits and in occupancy and depreciation costs of 2.9 million and 0.7 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in other counseling services and support expenses of 0.2 million. The increases in employee compensation and related expenses including benefits were primarily due to increased headcount to support our university partners and their planned increases in enrollment, tenure-based salary adjustments and the increased number of off-campus classroom and laboratory sites open year over year. The increase in occupancy and depreciation is primarily related to higher depreciation expense associated with our continued enhancements to IT infrastructure and internal-use software development. Our counseling services and support expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.9 to 32.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 33.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due our ability to leverage our counseling services and support expenses across an increasing revenue base. We anticipate that counseling services and support expense will increase in the future as we continue to invest to meet our partners needs. Marketing and communication . Our marketing and communication expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 54.5 million, an increase of 1.4 million, or 2.7 , as compared to marketing and communication expenses of 53.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to the increased cost to market our university partners programs and to the marketing of new university partners and new locations which resulted in increased advertising of 0.9 million, increased employee compensation, including share-based compensation and benefits of 0.3 million, an increase in occupancy and depreciation of 0.1 million and an increase in other marketing and communication expenses of 0.1 million. Our marketing and communication expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.0 to 22.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 23.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to our ability to leverage our marketing and communication expenses across an increasing revenue base. We anticipate that marketing and communication expense will increase in the future as we continue to meet our partners needs. General and administrative . Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 14.4 million, an increase of 2.2 million, or 18.0 , as compared to general and administrative expenses of 12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees, primarily higher legal costs, an increase in contribution made in lieu of state income taxes and an increase in occupancy and depreciation costs of 1.1 million, 1.0 million and 0.1 million, respectively. Our general 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.5 to 6.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 5.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to our increase in contributions made in lieu of state income taxes and the higher professional fees partially offset by our ability to leverage our general and administrative expenses across an increasing revenue base. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue could continue to increase if legal costs continue to rise. Amortization of intangible assets . Amortization of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2.1 million for both periods. As a result of the acquisition of our wholly owned subsidiary, Orbis Education, certain identifiable intangible assets were created (primarily customer relationships) that will be amortized over their expected lives. Investment interest and other . Investment interest and other for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.2 million, as compared to investment interest and other for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 2.7 million due to higher investment balances and higher returns on those balances. Income tax expense . Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.9 million, an increase of 2.4 million, or 27.2 , as compared to income tax expense of 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was 20.8 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 19.3 during the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate increased year over year due to higher state income taxes. Net income . Our net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 41.5 million, an increase of 5.8 million, or 16.0 , as compared to 35.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the factors discussed above. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Service revenue . Our service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 740.4 million, an increase of 57.8 million, or 8.5 , as compared to service revenue of 682.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase year over year in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in GCU enrollments to 123,002 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.0 over enrollments at September 30, 2023, an increase in university partner enrollments at our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites to 5,888 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 8.1 over enrollments at September 30, 2023, which includes 913 and 510 GCU students at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and an increase in revenue per student year over year. The increase in revenue per student between years is primarily due to the s ervice revenue per student for ABSN students at off-campus classroom and laboratory sites generating a significantly higher revenue per student than we earn under our agreement with GCU, as these agreements generally provide us with a higher revenue share percentage, the partners have higher tuition rates than GCU and the majority of their students take more credits on average per semester. The increase in revenue per student in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also due to the timing of the Fall semester for the ground traditional campus. The Fall semester started two days earlier in 2024 than in 2023, which had the effect of shifting 2.2 million in service revenue from the fourth quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2024 in comparison to the prior year. The additional day for leap year in 2024 added additional service revenue of 1.5 million as compared to the prior year. Contract modifications for some of our university partners in which the revenue share percentage was reduced in exchange for us no longer reimbursing the partner for certain faculty costs and the termination of one university partner contract at the end of the Spring 2024 semester had the effect of reducing revenue per student. Partner enrollments totaled 127,977 at September 30, 2024 as compared to 123,165 at September 30, 2023. Although partner enrollments at our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites returned to year over year growth in 2024, some existing partners continue to experience reduced incoming cohort sizes which has slowed the growth.

 impacted the enrollment growth. Enrollments for GCU ground students were 24,657 at September 30, 2024 down from 25,232 at September 30, 2023 due to a small decline in traditional ground students year over year and the continued decline in professional studies students, working adults attending the university s traditional campus at night, partially offset by an increase in ABSN students between years. GCU online enrollments were 98,345 at September 30, 2024, up from 92,995 at September 30, 2023, an increase of 5.8 between years. Technology and academic services . Our technology and academic services expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 122.1 million, an increase of 6.5 million, or 5.6 , as compared to technology and academic services expenses of 115.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in other technology and academic costs and in occupancy and depreciation of 4.9 million and 4.0 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation and related expenses, including share-based compensation of 2.4 million. The increases in other technology and academic costs and occupancy and depreciation were primarily due to the costs associated with the increased number of off-campus classroom and laboratory sites to support our 22 university partners and their increased enrollment growth. The decrease in employee compensation and related expenses is primarily due to decreased faculty reimbursements due to changes in our agreements with certain university partners whereby we no longer reimburse these partners for their faculty costs, partially offset by increased headcount to support our 22 university partners and their increased enrollment growth, tenure-based salary adjustments and the increased number of off-campus classroom and laboratory sites year over year. Our technology and academic services expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.4 to 16.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 16.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the decreased faculty reimbursements between years. We anticipate that technology and academic services expenses as a percentage of revenue will increase in the future as we open more off-site classroom and laboratory sites although these increases might be offset by lower faculty reimbursements if more partners choose to adjust their contracts. Counseling services and support . Our counseling services and support expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 238.2 million, an increase of 18.6 million, or 8.5 , as compared to counseling services and support expenses of 219.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and related expenses including share-based compensation and benefits, in occupancy and depreciation costs and in other counseling services and support expenses of 14.4 million, 2.4 million and 1.8 million, respectively. The increases in employee compensation including share-based compensation and benefits were primarily due to increased headcount to support our university partners, and their planned increases in enrollment, tenure-based salary adjustments and the increased number of off-campus classroom and laboratory sites open year over year. The increase in occupancy and depreciation is primarily related to higher depreciation expense associated with our continued enhancements to IT infrastructure and internal-use software development. The increase in other counseling services and support expenses is primarily the result of increased travel costs for our 22 university partners. Our counseling services and support expenses as a percentage of revenue stayed flat at 32.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We anticipate that counseling services and support expense will increase in the future as we continue to invest to meet our partners needs. Marketing and communication . Our marketing and communication expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 162.8 million, an increase of 6.0 million, or 3.8 , as compared to marketing and communication expenses of 156.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to the increased cost to market our university partners programs and to the marketing of new university partners and new locations which resulted in increased advertising of 4.8 million, increased employee compensation, including share-based compensation and benefits of 0.6 million, an increase in other marketing and communication expenses of 0.4 million and an increase in occupancy and depreciation costs of 0.2 million. Our marketing and communication expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.0 to 22.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 23.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to our ability to leverage our marketing and communication expenses across an increasing revenue base. We anticipate that marketing and communication expenses will increase in the future as we continue to invest to meet our partners needs. General and administrative . Our general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 35.7 million, an increase of 2.9 million, or 8.8 , as compared to general and administrative expenses of 32.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in employee compensation, including share-based compensation and benefits of 1.5 million, which includes 1.1 million in severance costs recorded for an executive that resigned June 30, 2024, professional fees of 1.0 million, an increase in 

 27 

Table of Contents 
 contributions in lieu of state income taxes of 1.0 million and increases in occupancy and depreciation costs of 0.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other administrative expenses of 0.8 million primarily due to lower travel costs. Our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue stayed flat at 4.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due to our ability to leverage our general and administrative expenses across an increasing revenue base partially offset by the severance costs. General and administrative expenses could increase if legal costs continue to rise. Amortization of intangible assets . Amortization of intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 6.3 million for both periods. As a result of the acquisition of our wholly owned subsidiary, Orbis Education, certain identifiable intangible assets were created (primarily customer relationships) that will be amortized over their expected lives. Investment interest and other . Investment interest and other for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 12.0 million, as compared to investment interest and other for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 7.5 million due to higher investment balances and higher returns on those balances. Income tax expense . Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 43.0 million, an increase of 8.4 million, or 24.2 , as compared to income tax expense of 34.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was 23.0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.8 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by excess tax benefits of 1.5 million as compared to 0.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate increased year over year due to higher state income taxes. Net income . Our net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 144.4 million, an increase of 20.1 million, or 17.9 , as compared to 124.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the factors discussed above. Seasonality Our net revenue and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to changes in our university partners enrollment. Our partners enrollment varies as a result of new enrollments, graduations, and student attrition. Revenues in the Summer months (May through August) are lower primarily due to the majority of GCU s traditional ground university students not attending courses during the Summer months, which affects our results for our second and third fiscal quarters. Since a significant amount of our costs are fixed, the lower revenue resulting from the decreased Summer enrollment has historically contributed to lower operating margins during those periods. Partially offsetting this Summer effect has been the sequential quarterly increase in enrollments that has occurred as a result of the traditional Fall school start. This increase in enrollments also has occurred in the first quarter, corresponding to calendar year matriculation. Thus, we experience higher net revenue in the fourth quarter due to its overlap with the semester encompassing the traditional Fall school start and in the first quarter due to its overlap with the first semester of the calendar year. A portion of our expenses do not vary proportionately with these fluctuations in service revenue, resulting in higher operating income in the first and fourth quarters relative to other quarters. We expect quarterly fluctuation in operating results to continue as a result of these seasonal patterns. Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, As of December 31, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and investments 263,584 244,506 Overview Our liquidity position, as measured by cash and cash equivalents and investments increased by 19.1 million between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, which was largely attributable to cash flows from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 exceeding share repurchases, changes in our investment balances and capital expenditures. See Note 11 for subsequent event relating to our cash and cash equivalents. Based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that our cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents and investments, will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations, planned capital expenditures, and working capital requirements for at least the next 24 months.

 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 154,141 127,277 The increase in cash generated from operating activities between the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increased income and changes in working capital balances, primarily accounts payable and accounts receivable. Accrued payable increased between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 by 6.8 million more than it did between December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023 due to the timing of check runs. These increases were partially offset by accounts receivable from GCU increasing by 10.5 million more than it did between December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023 due primarily to timing of the collections of our other university partners. We define working capital as the assets and liabilities, other than cash, generated through the Company s primary operating activities. Changes in these balances are included in the changes in assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 71,297 (70,530) Investing activities provided 71.3 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to consuming 70.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by or used in investing activities includes net investment activity. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, proceeds from the sale of investments, net of purchases of available-for-sale securities were 99.0 million.

In the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 cash used in investing activities also included capital expenditures totaling 27.5 million and 34.2 million, respectively. Capital expenditures for both periods primarily consisted of leasehold improvements and equipment for new off-campus classroom and laboratory sites, as well as purchases of computer equipment, internal use software projects and furniture and equipment to support our increasing employee headcount. The Company incurs upfront expenses and capital expenditures prior to an off-campus classroom and laboratory site being opened. The Company intends to continue to spend approximately 30.0 million to 40.0 million per year for capital expenditures. Cash Flows from Financing Activities

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 100.5 million and 114.0 million, respectively was used to purchase treasury stock in accordance with GCE s share repurchase program. In 2024 and 2023, 7.8 million and 6.3 million, respectively, of cash was utilized to purchase common shares withheld in lieu of income taxes resulting from the vesting of restricted share awards. The Company intends to continue using a significant portion of its cash flows from operations to repurchase its shares. Share Repurchase Program The Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases of up to 2,045,000 since the initiation of the Company s stock repurchase program.

We repurchased 725,181 shares of common stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, there remains 164.5 million available under our share repurchase authorization . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk . As of September 30, 2024, we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments. We invest cash in excess of current operating requirements in money market instruments and commercial paper at multiple financial institutions. Interest rate risk . We manage interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents, BBB or higher rated corporate bonds, commercial paper, agency bonds, treasury bills, municipal securities, asset backed securities, municipal bonds, and collateralized mortgage obligations bearing variable interest rates, which are tied to various market indices or individual bond coupon rates. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities before their maturity date that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024, a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings, fair values, or cash flows. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as of September 30, 2024, in ensuring that material information relating to us required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Based on an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who is our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (who is our principal financial officer), there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
