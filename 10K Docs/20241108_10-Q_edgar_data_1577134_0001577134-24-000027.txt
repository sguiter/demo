In connection with the Merger, Terra LLC assumed the obligations of Terra BDC under the indenture governing the fixed-rate notes due 2026. 
 The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Terra REIT, and its investment objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to Terra REIT s stockholders, primarily through Terra REIT s regular distributions. Terra REIT s investments activities are externally managed by Terra REIT Advisors, LLC (the REIT Manager ), an affiliate of the Company. The Company originates, invests in and manages a diverse portfolio of real estate-related investments that generate a stable income stream. The Company directly originates, structures and underwrites most, if not all, of its loans, as it believes that doing so will provide it with the best opportunity to invest in loans that satisfy its standards, establish a direct relationship with the borrower and optimize the terms of its investments; however, the Company may acquire existing loans from the originating lender should the REIT Manager determine such an investment is in its best interest. The Company may hold its investments until their scheduled maturity dates or may sell them if the Company is able to command favorable terms for their disposition. The Company may also seek to realize growth in the value of its investments by timing their sale to maximize value. 
 The Company may also make strategic non-real estate-related investments that align with its investment objectives and criteria.

 million increase to total reserve, including reserve on future funding commitments, which was recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to member s capital as of January 1, 2023. Subsequent to the adoption of the CECL methodology, any increase or decrease to the allowance for credit losses is recorded in earnings on the consolidated statement of operations. 
 Performing Loans 
 The Company uses a model-based approach for estimating the allowance for credit losses on performing loans on a collective basis, including future funding commitments for which the Company does not have the unconditional right to cancel, as these loans share similar risk characteristics. The Company utilizes information obtained from internal and external sources relating to past events, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future to determine the expected credit losses for its loan portfolio. The Company utilizes a commercial mortgage-based, third-party loan loss model and because the Company does not have a meaningful history of realized credit losses on its loan portfolio, it subscribes to a database service to provide historical proxy loan loss information. The Company employs logistic regression to forecast expected losses at the loan level based on a commercial real estate loan securitization database that contains activity dating back to 1998. The Company has chosen to incorporate a weighted average macroeconomic forecast that encompasses baseline, upside and downside scenarios, into its allowance for credit losses on performing loans estimate during the reasonable and supportable forecast period which is currently eight quarters. The Company selects certain economics variables from a group of independent variables such as Commercial Real Estate Price Index, unemployment and interest rate which are included in the model as part of macroeconomic forecast and updated regularly based on current economic trends. The specific loan level information input into the model includes loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratio metrics, as well as principal balances, property type, location, coupon rate, coupon rate type, original or remaining term, expected repayment dates and contractual

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 As described in Note 2 , on January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13, which requires entities to recognize credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 resulted in a million increase to total reserve, including reserve on future funding commitments, which was recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to member s capital as of January 1, 2023. 
 Certain of the Company s performing loans contain provisions for future funding commitments, which are subject to the borrower meeting certain performance-related metrics that are monitored by the Company. These unfunded commitments on loans amounted to approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The liability for credit losses on unfunded commitments is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 As discussed in Note 2 , for loans that are considered non-performing, the Company removes them from the industry loss rate approach and analyzes them separately for recoverability or based on sponsor s guarantee. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had non-performing loans with total carrying value, excluding specific allowance, of million and million, respectively. Accordingly, the Company utilized the estimated fair value of the loan collateral or sponsor s guarantee to estimate the total specific allowance for credit losses of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Please see Significant Unobservable Inputs in Note 5 for information on how the fair values of these loans were determined.

 Accrued Interest Receivable 
 The Company elected not to measure a CECL reserve on accrued interest receivable due to the Company s policy of writing off uncollectible accrued interest receivable balances in a timely manner. If the Company determines it has uncollectible accrued interest receivable, it generally will reverse the accrued and unpaid interest against interest income and suspend the accrual for future interest income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not reverse any interest income accrual because all accrued interest income was deemed collectible. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had loans that were in default, and suspended interest income accrual of million and million, respectively, and million and million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, because recovery of such income was not probable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was outstanding interest receivable on these loans. 
 Loan Risk Rating 
 The Company assesses the risk factors of each performing loan and assigns each performing loan a risk rating between 1 and 5, which is an average of the numerical ratings in the following categories: (i) sponsor capability and financial condition; (ii) loan and collateral performance relative to underwriting; (iii) quality and stability of collateral cash flows and/or reserve balances; and (iv) loan to value. 
 Additionally, as discussed in Note 2 , during the loan review process, if the Company determines that it is not able to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of a loan, or if a loan is in maturity default, the Company considers that loan non-performing.

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and the Company considers factors specific to the investment. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had not elected the fair value option for its financial instruments, including loans held for investment, loans held for investment acquired through participation, term loan payable and unsecured notes payable. Such financial instruments are carried at cost, less impairment or less net deferred costs, where applicable. Held-to-maturity debt securities are financial instruments that are reported at amortized cost. 
 Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 From time to time, the Company may invest in short-term debt and equity securities which are classified as available-for-sale securities, and are presented at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of equity securities are recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of debt securities are reported in other comprehensive income until the securities are realized. Additionally, the Company may invest in short-term money market funds. These funds are included in cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet due to their short-term nature and can be easily converted to cash.

 (4) Valuation falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, which is based on a discounted cash flow model with a discount rate of , as of December 31, 2023. 
 Valuation Methodology 
 The fair value of the Company s investment in corporate bonds, preferred stock and common stock within the marketable securities portfolio, if any, is determined based on quoted prices in an active market and is classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Additionally, the fair value of the Company s unsecured notes payable is determined based on quoted price in an active market and is also classified as Level 1. 
 Market quotations are not readily available for the Company s real estate-related loan investments, all of which are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as these investments are valued utilizing a yield approach, i.e., a discounted cash flow methodology to arrive at an estimate of the fair value of each respective investment in the portfolio using an estimated market yield. In following this methodology, investments are evaluated individually, and management takes into account, in determining the risk-adjusted discount rate for each of the Company s investments, relevant factors, including available current market data on applicable yields of comparable debt/preferred equity instruments; market credit spreads and yield curves; the investment s yield; covenants of the investment, including prepayment provisions; the ability of the Company s borrowers and investees to make payments, net operating income and debt service coverage ratio; construction progress reports and construction budget analysis; the nature, quality and realizable value of any collateral (and loan-to-value ratio); the forces that influence the local markets in which the asset (the collateral) is purchased and sold, such as capitalization rates, occupancy rates, rental rates and replacement costs; and the anticipated duration of each real estate-related loan investment. 
 These valuation techniques are applied in a consistent and verifiable manner to all investments that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the REIT Manager provides the board of directors of Terra REIT (the Terra REIT Board ), (a majority of which is made up of independent directors) with the investment valuations that are based on this discounted cash flow methodology. Valuations are prepared quarterly, or more frequently as needed, with each asset in the portfolio subject to a valuation prepared by a third-party valuation service at a minimum of once during every 12-month period. REIT Manager reviews the preliminary valuation with the Terra REIT Board and, together with an independent valuation firm, if applicable, responds and supplements the preliminary valuation to reflect any comments provided by the Terra REIT Board. The REIT Manager discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on various metrics and other factors, including the input and recommendation provided by the Terra REIT Board and any third-party valuation firm, if applicable.

These inputs are based on the location, type and nature of the property, current sales and lease comparables, anticipated real estate and capital market conditions, and management s knowledge, experience and judgment. Additionally, the Company may use sales comparables to corroborate the estimated value of a loan s collateral or may use sponsor s guarantee to estimate the value of a non-performing loan. 
 If the weighted average discount rate used to value the Company s investments were to increase, the fair value of the Company s investments would decrease. Conversely, if the weighted average discount rate used to value the Company s investments were to decrease, the fair value of Company s investments would increase.

 Overview 
 Terra Income Fund 6 LLC Terra LLC was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on April 29, 2022 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Terra REIT. On October 1, 2022, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 2, 2022 (as amended, the Merger Agreement ), Terra Income Fund 6, Inc. Terra BDC merged with and into Terra LLC, with Terra LLC continuing as the surviving entity of the merger (the Merger ). Subsequent to the Merger, Terra LLC became the successor of Terra BDC and assumed all of Terra BDC s rights and obligations, including the obligations under the indenture governing Terra BDC s unsecured notes payable. 
 We are a wholly owned subsidiary of Terra REIT. Terra REIT s investments activities are externally managed by the REIT Manager, our affiliate. We originate, invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate-related investments that generate a stable income stream. We directly originate, structure and underwrite most, if not all, of our loans, as we believe that doing so will provide us with the best opportunity to invest in loans that satisfy our standards, establish a direct relationship with the borrower and optimize the terms of its investments; however, we may acquire existing loans from the originating lender should its adviser determine such an investment is in its best interest. We may also make strategic non-real estate related investments that align with our investment objectives and criteria. We may hold our investments until their scheduled maturity dates or may sell them if we are able to command favorable terms for their disposition. We may seek to realize growth in the value of its investments by timing their sale to maximize value. 
 On November 8, 2022, we entered into a cost sharing agreement with Terra REIT effective October 1, 2022, pursuant to which we reimburse Terra REIT for its allocable portion of management and transaction fees and operating expenses incurred by Terra REIT, including fees paid by Terra REIT to the REIT Manager (the Cost Sharing Agreement ).

 (2) As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, two loans were subject to SOFR or Term SOFR floor, as applicable. 
 Equity Investments 
 In addition to our loan portfolio, we owned equity interests in two joint ventures that own real estate properties. We account for our equity interest in the joint ventures as equity method investments because we do not have a controlling financial interest in the entities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these equity investments had total carrying value of 37.2 million and 40.4 million, respectively. 
 Portfolio Investment Activity 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we invested 5.9 million and 1.3 million in new and add-on investments, and had 5.0 million and none of repayments, resulting in net investment of 0.9 million and 1.3 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, new and add-on investments included 5.8 million of funding and 5.0 million of repayment under the promissory note receivable. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we invested 41.1 million and 42.5 million in new and add-on investments, and had 44.9 million and 51.8 million of repayments, resulting in net repayments of 3.9 million and 9.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, new and add-on investments included 40.1 million of funding and 5.0 million of repayment under the promissory note receivable. 
 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 On February 10, 2021, Terra BDC issued 34.8 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.00 fixed-rate notes due 2026, and on February 26, 2021, the underwriters exercised the option to purchase an additional 3.6 million of the notes (collectively the 7.00 Senior Notes Due 2026 ). The 7.00 Senior Notes Due 2026 may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at Terra BDC s option on or after February 10, 2023, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the outstanding principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with the Merger, Terra LLC assumed all of Terra BDC s rights and obligations under the indenture governing the 7.00 Senior Notes Due 2026. 
 Term Loan 
 In April 2021, Terra BDC entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with a lender to provide for a delayed draw term loan of 25.0 million (the Term Loan ). On September 27, 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, remove the make whole premium on voluntary prepayment of the loans as well as to provide consent to the consummation of the Merger and the assumption by Terra LLC of all of the rights and obligations of Terra BDC under the Credit Agreement. On June 30, 2023, we amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) decrease the principal amount to 15.0 million, (ii) extend the scheduled maturity date to March 31, 2024, and (iii) increase the rate on which the loans thereunder bear interest from a fixed rate of 5.625 per annum to a floating rate based on SOFR plus 7.375 with a SOFR floor of 5.0 , and repaid 10.0 million of the principal amount of the Term Loan. The Credit Agreement was secured by 
 24 

a lien on substantially all of Terra BDC s, and, following the Merger, Terra LLC s owned and thereafter acquired property. In March 2024, the Term Loan was repaid in full. 
 Factors Impacting Operating Results 
 Our portfolio is concentrated in a limited number of industries and borrowers, and, as a result, a downturn in any particular industry or borrower in which we are heavily invested may significantly impact the aggregate returns we realize. If an industry in which we are heavily invested suffers from adverse business or economic conditions, a material portion of our investment could be affected adversely, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. For example, as of September 30, 2024, our investments secured by office and mixed-used properties represented approximately 72.4 and 10.5 , respectively, of the principal balance of our total net loan investments. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we held only four loan investments and our largest net loan investment represented approximately 72.4 of the principal balance of our total net loan investments and our largest three net loan investments represented approximately 91.8 of the principal balance of our total net loan investments. 
 Results of Operations 
 Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

 Net Loan Portfolio 
 In assessing the performance of our loans, we believe it is appropriate to evaluate the loans on an economic basis, that is, gross loans net of obligations under participation agreements. The following table presents a reconciliation of our loan portfolio on a weighted average basis from gross to net : 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Weighted Average Principal Amount Weighted Average Coupon Rate Weighted Average Principal Amount Weighted Average Coupon Rate Gross loan investments 48,782,203 15.9 86,005,460 15.1 Obligation under participation agreement (15,000,000) 20.3 Net loan investments 33,782,203 13.9 86,005,460 15.1

 Interest Income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest income decreased by 0.5 million and 2.1 million, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average principal balance of gross loans, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average coupon rate due to increases in the underlying index rates and the interest income earned on the promissory note receivable. 
 Asset Management and Asset Servicing Fees 
 On November 8, 2022, we entered into the Cost Sharing Agreement with Terra REIT effective October 1, 2022, pursuant to which we reimburse Terra REIT for our allocable portion of management and transaction fees and operating expenses incurred by Terra REIT, including fees paid by Terra REIT to the REIT Manager. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, management fees consisting of asset management and asset servicing fees paid/payable to Terra REIT pursuant to the Cost Sharing Agreement decreased by 0.2 million and 0.4 million, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in total funds under management. 
 Operating Expense Reimbursement 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating expense incurred on our behalf pursuant to the Cost Sharing Agreement decreased by 0.2 million and 0.2 million, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in the allocation ratio as well as a decrease in costs being allocated. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 On January 1, 2023, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASU 2016-13 ), which requires entities to recognize credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 0.5 million and 1.6 million, respectively, primarily as a result of a decline in our estimated recoverable amount on a non-performing subordinated loan due to an increase in funding on the senior loan. 
 26 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 1.7 million and 1.6 million, primarily as a result of a decline in the fair value of the collateral of a loan due to a decline in the macroeconomic outlook for commercial real estate. 
 Professional Fees 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, professional fees were substantially the same. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, professional fees decreased by 0.1 million, primarily due to legal fees incurred in connection with the SEC industry inquiry in 2023. 
 Loss From Equity Investment In Unconsolidated Investments 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss from equity investment in unconsolidated investment of 0.8 million and 2.9 million, respectively, related to our portion of the net loss incurred by the two joint ventures that own real estate properties primarily as a result of depreciation expense and interest expense on floating rate loans. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized loss from equity investment in unconsolidated investment of 0.5 million and 0.4 million, respectively, primarily related to the equity loss from the joint venture that invests in real estate properties, partially offset by interest income earned on a 10.0 million mezzanine loan for which we accounted for using the equity method of accounting due to the profit sharing arrangement. 
 Interest Expense on Unsecured Notes Payable 
 As discussed in the section entitled Senior Unsecured Notes above, we assumed the 38.4 million 7.00 Senior Notes Due 2026 in connection with the Merger. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense on unsecured notes payable remained substantially the same. 
 Interest Expense on Term Loan 
 As discussed in the section entitled Term Loan above, we assumed the 25.0 million Term Loan in connection with the Merger. In June 30, 2023, we made a 10.0 million partial repayment on the Term Loan. In March 2024, the Term Loan was repaid in full. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense on the Term Loan decreased by 0.5 million and 0.7 million, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average outstanding balance, partially offset by an increase in contractual interest rate. 
 Interest Expense From Obligation Under Participation Agreement 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense from obligation under participation agreement was 0.8 million and 2.3 million, respectively, primarily related to a portion of a loan we transferred to an affiliate via a participation agreement for which it did not qualify for sale treatment. There was no such interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net loss 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the resulting net loss decreased by 0.5 million and increased by 5.5 million, respectively. 
 Terra REIT s Management Agreement with the REIT Manager 
 Terra REIT is our parent and sole member. We have entered into a cost sharing arrangement with Terra REIT pursuant to which we will be responsible for our allocable share of Terra REIT s expenses, including fees paid by Terra REIT to its manager, the REIT Manager. Terra REIT currently pays the following fees to the REIT Manager pursuant to a management agreement: 
 Origination and Extension Fee. An origination fee in the amount of 1.0 of the amount used to originate, acquire, fund or structure real estate-related investments, including any third-party expenses related to such loan. In the event that the term of any real estate-related loan is extended, the REIT Manager also receives an origination fee equal to the lesser of (i) 1.0 of the principal amount of the loan being extended or (ii) the amount of fee paid by the borrower in connection with such extension. 
 27 

Asset Management Fee . A monthly asset management fee at an annual rate equal to 1.0 of the aggregate funds under management, which includes the loan origination amount or aggregate gross acquisition cost, as applicable, for each real estate-related loan and cash held by Terra REIT. 
 Asset Servicing Fee . A monthly asset servicing fee at an annual rate equal to 0.25 of the aggregate gross origination price or aggregate gross acquisition price for each real estate related loan then held by Terra REIT (inclusive of closing costs and expenses). 
 Disposition Fee. A disposition fee in the amount of 1.0 of the gross sale price received by Terra REIT from the disposition of each loan, but not upon the maturity, prepayment, workout, modification or extension of a loan unless there is a corresponding fee paid by the borrower, in which case the disposition fee will be the lesser of (i) 1.0 of the principal amount of the loan and ii) the amount of the fee paid by the borrower in connection with such transaction. If Terra REIT takes ownership of a property as a result of a workout or foreclosure of a loan, Terra REIT will pay a disposition fee upon the sale of such property equal to 1.0 of the sales price. 
 Transaction Breakup Fee . In the event that Terra REIT receive any breakup fees, busted-deal fees, termination fees, or similar fees or liquidated damages from a third-party in connection with the termination or non-consummation of any loan or disposition transaction, the REIT Manager will be entitled to receive one-half of such amounts, in addition to the reimbursement of all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the REIT Manager with respect to its evaluation and pursuit of such transactions. 
 In addition to the fees described above, Terra REIT reimburses the REIT Manager for operating expenses incurred in connection with services provided to the operations of Terra REIT, including its allocable share of the REIT Manager s overhead, such as rent, employee costs, utilities, and technology costs. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We currently generate cash primarily from cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments, principal repayments, and proceeds from sales of our investments. Our primary use of cash is for our targeted assets and payments of our expenses. 
 We may borrow funds to make investments to the extent we determine that leveraging our portfolio would be appropriate. In February 2021, Terra BDC issued 38.4 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.00 fixed-rate notes due 2026, for net proceeds of 37.2 million after deducting underwriting commissions of 1.2 million. On October 1, 2022 in connection with the Merger, Terra BDC, Terra LLC and U.S. Bank National Association entered into a second supplemental indenture pursuant to which Terra LLC assumed the payment of the notes and the performance of every covenant of the indenture, to be performed or observed by Terra BDC. 
 Certain of our loans provide for commitments to fund the borrower at a future date. As of September 30, 2024, we had one loan with funding commitments of 19.3 million, of which we funded 18.6 million. We do not expect to fund the remaining 0.7 million unfunded commitments to the borrower in the next twelve months as the borrower has not met the requirement for funding. Additionally, our 15.0 million obligation under participation agreement will mature in the next twelve months. We expect to use the proceeds from the repayment of the corresponding investment to repay the participation obligation. 
 Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 0.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was 1.9 million. The decrease in operating cash was primarily due to decrease in contractual interest income. 
 Cash Flows Provided by Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was 4.1 million, primarily related to proceeds from repayment of loans of 39.9 million and proceeds from repayment of promissory note receivable of 5.0 million, partially offset by funding for promissory note receivable of 40.1 million and origination and purchase of loans of 1.0 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by investing activities was 9.7 million, primarily related to proceeds from repayment of loans of 41.8 million, proceeds from sale of held-to-maturity debt securities of 10.0 million and distributions received from unconsolidated investment of 0.4 million, partially offset by purchase of equity interest in unconsolidated investment of 27.4 million, purchase of held-to-maturity debt securities of 10.0 million, payments for origination and purchase of loans of 4.6 million and payment for marketable securities of 0.5 million. 
 28 

Cash Flows From Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was 0.1 million, primarily due to repayment of the Term Loan of 15.0 million as well as a decrease in interest reserve and other deposits held on investment of 0.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from obligation under participation agreement of 15.0 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was 9.4 million, primarily due to the repayments of borrowings under term loan payable of 10.0 million and payment for financing cost of 0.2 million, partially offset by an increase in interest reserve and other deposits held on investments of 0.8 million. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has utilized available information, including industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As we execute our expected operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future consolidated financial statements in addition to those discussed below. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 On January 1, 2023, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-13, which requires entities to recognize credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses CECL ). The CECL model requires the consideration of possible credit losses over the life of an instrument as opposed to estimating credit losses upon the occurrence of an actual loss event under the previous incurred loss methodology. 
 We use a model-based approach for estimating the allowance for credit losses on performing loans on a collective basis, including future funding commitments for which we do not have the unconditional right to cancel, as these loans share similar risk characteristics. We utilize information obtained from internal and external sources relating to past events, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future to determine the expected credit losses for our loan portfolio. We utilize a commercial mortgage-based, third-party loan loss model and because we do not have a meaningful history of realized credit losses on our loan portfolio, we subscribe to a database service to provide historical proxy loan loss information. We employ logistic regression to forecast expected losses at the loan level based on a commercial real estate loan securitization database that contains activity dating back to 1998. We have chosen to incorporate a weighted average macroeconomic forecast that encompasses baseline, upside and downside scenarios, into our allowance for credit losses on performing loans estimate during the reasonable and supportable forecast period which is currently eight quarters. We select certain economics variables from a group of independent variables such as Commercial Real Estate Price Index, unemployment and interest rate which are included in the model as part of macroeconomic forecast and updated regularly based on current economic trends. The specific loan level information input into the model includes loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratio metrics, as well as principal balances, property type, location, coupon rate, coupon rate type, original or remaining term, expected repayment dates and contractual future funding commitments. Based on the inputs, the loan loss model determines a loan loss rate through the generation of a probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) for each loan. The allowance for credit losses on performing loans is then calculated by applying the loan loss rate to the total outstanding loan balance of each loan. A significant amount of judgment is applied in selecting inputs and analyzing results produced by the models to determine the allowance for credit losses. Changes in such estimates can significantly affect the expected credit losses.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of our sole and managing member, Terra REIT, performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our company would perform if we had any officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that we would meet our disclosure obligations. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the most recent fiscal quarter, there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting, as defined under Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Neither we nor Terra REIT nor the REIT Manager is currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are material legal proceedings threatened against us, Terra REIT, or the REIT Manager. From time to time, we and individuals employed by Terra REIT may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 For a discussion of the potential risks and uncertainties associated with our business, please see Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. You should be aware that those risk factors may not describe every risk facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
