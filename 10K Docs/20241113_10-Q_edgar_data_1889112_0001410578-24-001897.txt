The Company will provide its public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A Ordinary Shares upon the completion of an initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in the Company s discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require the Company to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirements.

 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. The Company s initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed to (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares if the Company fails to complete an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, and (iii) vote their founder shares and public shares in favor of the Company s initial Business Combination. The Sponsor has agreed it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third - party claims. The Company has not independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, the Company cannot provide assurance that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for the initial Business Combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than per public share. In such event, the Company may not be able to complete the initial Business Combination, and redemptions may be a lesser than per share in connection with any redemption of the public shares. None of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. Risks and Uncertainties The military conflict commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation in Ukraine and the surrounding region, and Hamas and Iran s attack on Israel and the ensuing war, have created and are expected to create further global economic consequences, including but not limited to the possibility of extreme volatility and disruptions in the financial markets, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in inflation rates and uncertainty about economic and political stability. Such global consequences may materially and adversely affect the Company s ability to consummate an initial Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates an initial Business Combination. In addition, the Company s ability to consummate an initial Business Combination may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the global economy and the specific impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate an initial Business Combination are not yet determinable. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

A total of 236,900,000 10.30 per unit) of the net proceeds from the initial public offering, including the full exercise of the over-allotment option, the sale of the private placement warrants and the sponsor loan, was placed in the trust account. Transaction costs of the initial public offering amounted to 16,804,728, consisting of 4,600,000 of underwriting commissions, 11,500,000 of deferred underwriting commissions and 704,728 of other offering costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 351,168. Net income of 7,551,693 was affected by change in the fair value of warrant liabilities of 1,168,323, a change in the fair value of the convertible promissory note related party of 97,479 and interest earned on cash and marketable securities held in the trust account of 6,924,394. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 287,335 of cash for operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 446,686. Net income of 9,296,631 was affected by interest earned on cash and marketable securities held in the trust account of 8,925,457, a change in the fair value of a convertible promissory note of 15,494 and a change in the fair value of warrant liabilities of 1,155,723. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 322,369 of cash for operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and marketable securities held in the trust account of 182,526,592 (including approximately 21,413,154 of interest income consisting of U.S. treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less). We may withdraw interest from the trust account to pay taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less any taxes payable), to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash held outside of the trust account of 199,764 available for working capital needs. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business combination, and to pay for directors and officers liability insurance premiums. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required (the working capital loans ). If we complete a business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the funds held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of the working capital loans may be converted into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender (the working capital warrants ). The working capital warrants will be identical to the private placement warrants, including, as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings under any working capital loans. On October 12, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of 500,000 to the sponsor, which was funded in its entirety by the sponsor (the October 2023 Note ). Additionally, on January 19, 2024 and July 12, 2024, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of 250,000 to the sponsor (the 2024 Note and the July 2024 Note together with the October 2023 Note, the Notes ). The Notes do not bear interest and the principal balance will be payable on the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which we consummate our initial business combination and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective (such earlier date, the Maturity Date ). In the event we consummate our initial business combination, the sponsor has the option on the Maturity Date to convert all or any portion of the principal outstanding under each of the Notes into that number of working capital warrants equal to the portion of the principal amount of the Notes being converted divided by 1.00, rounded up to the nearest whole number. In connection with the First Charter Amendment Extension Payments described above, on November 6, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of up to 1,800,000, dated November 6, 2023, by the Company in favor of the sponsor (the

 First Extension Note ). The First Extension Note bears no interest and the principal balance is payable on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination. The First Extension Note is not convertible into private placement warrants and the principal balance may be prepaid at any time. From November 2023 through October 2024, the Board approved twelve monthly extensions of the time period during which the Company may consummate an initial business combination. In connection with the extensions from November 10, 2023 through November 10, 2024, the Company drew an aggregate of 1,800,000 150,000 at each extension date) from the First Extension Note. The sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) which was deposited into the trust account. In connection with the Second Charter Amendment Extension Payments described above, on November 6, 2024, we issued the Second Extension Note. The Second Extension Note bears no interest and the principal balance is payable on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination. The Second Extension Note is convertible into private placement warrants and the principal balance may be prepaid at any time. The Board approved the first monthly extension of the time period during which the Company may consummate an initial business combination from November 10, 2024 through December 5, 2024 (the November 2024 Extension ). In connection with the November 2024 Extension, the Company drew an aggregate of 150,000 (the November 2024 Extension Payment from the Second Extension Note which was deposited into the trust account. On November 6, 2024, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of 250,000 (the November 2024 Note to the Sponsor, which was funded in its entirety by the Sponsor. The November 2024 Note does not bear interest and the principal balance will be payable on the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which the Company consummates its initial business combination and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective. In the event the Company consummates its initial business combination, the Sponsor has the option to convert all or any portion of the principal outstanding under the November 2024 Note into that number of warrants equal to the portion of the principal amount of the November 2024 Note being converted divided by 1.00, rounded up to the nearest whole number. Going Concern In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, management has determined that our liquidity condition and liquidation date raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after the applicable extended date. As of September 30, 2024, we had 199,764 in our operating bank accounts, 182,526,592 in marketable securities held in the trust account to be used for the completion of a business combination and/or for the redemption of the public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination by the applicable extended date (subject to applicable law) and working capital deficit of 2,689,447. Until the consummation of a business combination or our liquidation, we will use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business combination, and to pay for directors and officers liability insurance premiums. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us working capital loans. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or other long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay the sponsor a sum of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services. We began incurring these fees on May 5, 2022 and will continue to incur these fees on a monthly basis until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination and our liquidation.

 The underwriters of our initial public offering are entitled to a deferred underwriting commission of 0.50 per unit, or 11,500,000 in the aggregate. Subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement for our initial public offering, (i) the deferred underwriting commission was placed in the trust account and will be released to the underwriters only upon the consummation of our initial business combination and (ii) the deferred underwriting commission will be waived by the underwriters in the event that we do not complete a business combination. We have engaged a legal advisor to provide services related to the consummation of an initial business combination. In connection with this agreement, we may be required to pay the legal advisor s fees in connection with its services contingent upon a successful initial business combination. If a business combination does not occur, we would not be required to pay these contingent fees. There can be no assurance that we will complete a business combination. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial information. We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements included in this report. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant judgments in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. Some of the more significant estimates are in connection with determining the fair value of the warrant liabilities and convertible promissory notes related party. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and, therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates. Warrant Liabilities We account for the warrants issued in connection with the initial public offering, which are discussed in Note 3, Note 4 and Note 9 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging, Contracts in Entity s Own Equity. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, we classify each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in our statement of operations. Convertible Promissory Notes Related Party We account for the Sponsor Loan issued pursuant to convertible promissory note at no interest and a convertible promissory note issued on October 12, 2023, January 19, 2024 and July 12, 2024 to Sponsor under ASC Topic 815-15-25, Derivates and Heading Recognition ASC 815-15-25 ). Under ASC 815-15-25, at the inception of the convertible promissory note, the Company elected to account for such financial instrument under the fair value option. Under the fair value option, convertible promissory notes are required to be recorded at their fair value on the date of issuance, each drawdown date, and at each balance sheet date thereafter. Differences between the face value of the note and the fair value of the note at each drawdown date are recognized as either an expense in the statements of operations (if issued at a premium) or as a capital contribution (if issued at a discount). Changes in the estimated fair value of the notes are recognized as non-cash gains or losses in the statements of operations. The fair value of the conversion option embedded in the convertible promissory notes was valued utilizing the Monte Carlo model. See Note 9 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which requires disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. The Company s management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its financial statements and disclosures.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
