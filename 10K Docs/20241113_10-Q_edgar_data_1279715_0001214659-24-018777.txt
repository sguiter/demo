which are included in cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held
investments in U.S. Treasury Bills of and , respectively. As of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held investments in equity securities which consist of mutual funds of and ,
respectively. U.S. Treasury Bills are valued using a model that incorporates market observable data, such as reported sales of similar
securities, broker quotes, yields, bids, offers, and reference data. Certain securities are valued principally using dealer quotations.
Mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor from an actively traded exchange. U.S. Treasury Bills are categorized
in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, depending on the inputs used and market activity levels for specific securities. Mutual funds
are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, depending on the unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
The U.S. Treasury Bills, which have maturities of three months or less at time
of purchase , are reported as cash and cash equivalents, and those with longer maturities are reported as
Investments, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Short-term
investments in marketable debt securities have a stated maturity of twelve months or less from the balance sheet date. These securities
are considered as available for sale and are reported at fair value. For debt securities, unrealized gains and losses are recorded net
of tax as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity. Credit
losses related to available-for-sale debt securities are recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in
the amortized cost basis of the securities. Realized gains and losses are calculated based on the specific
identification method and are included in Interest and other income, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The
Company follows the guidance in ASC 321, Investments Equity Securities ASC 321 for its investments
in equity securities with unrealized and realized gains and losses recorded in Interest and other income, net, on the Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements 

This report contains forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical
facts, but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future events and results. The words may, will, 
 anticipate, should, would, believe, contemplate, could, 
 project, predict, expect, estimate, continue, and intend, 
as well as other similar words and expressions of the future, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 

Factors that may cause actual results to differ
from those results expressed or implied, include, but are not limited to, those listed under Risk Factors in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 27, 2024. 

These forward-looking
statements generally relate to our plans, objectives and expectations for future events and include statements about our expectations,
beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are
based upon our opinions and estimates as of the date they are made. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in
these forward-looking statements are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties
that may be beyond our control, which could cause actual results, performance and achievements to differ materially from results, performance
and achievements projected, expected, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. While we cannot assess the future
impact that any of these differences could have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or the market
price of shares of our common stock, the differences could be significant. You are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking
statements when evaluating the information presented in this report and you are urged to consider all such risks and uncertainties.
In light of the uncertainty inherent in such forward-looking statements, you should not consider their inclusion to be a representation
that such forward-looking matters will be achieved. 

General Overview 

The Company is a shell company ,
as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Because we are a shell company, our stockholders are unable to utilize Rule 144
to sell restricted stock as defined in Rule 144 or to otherwise use Rule 144 to sell our securities, and we are ineligible
to utilize registration statements on Form S-3 or Form S-8 for so long as we remain a shell company and for 12 months thereafter. As
a consequence, among other things, the offering, issuance and sale of our securities is likely to be more expensive and time consuming
and may make our securities less attractive to investors. 

The Company s
Board of Directors is considering strategic uses for its funds to develop or acquire interests in one or more operating businesses. While
we have focused our development or acquisition efforts on sectors in which our management has expertise, we do not wish to limit ourselves
to, or to foreclose any opportunities in, any particular industry or sector. Prior to this use, the Company s funds have
been, and we anticipate will continue to be, invested in high-grade, short-term investments (such as cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury
Bills and mutual funds) consistent with the preservation of principal, maintenance of liquidity and avoidance of speculation, until such
time as we need to utilize such funds, or any portion thereof, for the purposes described above. The directors will also consider
alternatives for distributing some or all of its cash and cash equivalents and Investments in U.S. Treasury Bills and mutual funds
 to stockholders.

decrease in Interest and other income of 56,000.

Other operating expenses were 144,000 as compared to 165,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decreased operating
expenses of 21,000 were primarily the result of decreased travel and entertainment expenses of 9,000, decreased fees related to the

Interest and other income was 20,000 as compared to 76,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decreased interest and
other income of 56,000 was primarily the result of decreased interest income earned from investments in U.S. Treasury Bills of 100,000,
offset by gain on investment of 44,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Income taxes 

For the three months

to the pre-tax loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, due to a full valuation allowance to offset any deferred
tax asset related to net operating loss carry forwards attributable to the losses.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,

ended September 30, 2023. 

The decreased loss from operations of 110,000
was primarily the result of a decrease in Other operating expenses of 89,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of Compensation and benefits of 4,000, offset by an increase in Interest and other income of 17,000.

Other operating expenses were 470,000 as compared to 559,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreased operating
expenses of 89,000 were primarily the result of decreased travel and entertainment expenses of 26,000, decreased other expenses of
 7,000, and decreased expenses related to the repair and maintenance of the Company owned dam properties of 56,000. The
dam properties were fully impaired as of December 31, 2018.

Interest and other income was 122,000 as compared to 105,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increased interest and

and the gain on investment of 8,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Income taxes 

For the nine months ended

to the pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, due to a full valuation allowance to offset any deferred tax
