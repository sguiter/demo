 On June 1, 2023, we completed the Billings Acquisition and acquired a ownership interest in YPLC.

 ownership interest in Laramie Energy, an entity focused on developing and producing natural gas in Garfield, Mesa, and Rio Blanco counties, Colorado. The balance of our investment in Laramie Energy was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 On February 21, 2023, Laramie Energy entered into a new term loan agreement which provides a million first lien term loan facility with million funded at closing and an optional million delayed draw commitment, subject to certain terms and conditions. The delayed draw commitment expired in August 2024. Under the terms of the new term loan, Laramie is permitted to make future cash distributions to its owners, including us, subject to certain restrictions. Laramie Energy s term loan matures on February 21, 2027. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the term loan had an outstanding balance of million. 
 On March 1, 2023, pursuant to its new term loan agreement, Laramie Energy made a one-time cash distribution to its owners, including us, based on ownership percentage. Our share of this distribution was million, which was reflected as Return of capital from Laramie Energy, LLC on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. We recorded the cash received as Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, LLC on our condensed consolidated statements of operations because the carrying value of our investment in Laramie Energy was zero at the time of such distribution. On April 29, 2024, Laramie Energy made a one-time cash distribution to its owners, including us, based on ownership percentage. Our share of this distribution was million.

 Obligations under inventory financing agreements 
 Inventory Intermediation Agreement 
 On May 31, 2024, Par Hawaii Refining, LLC PHR ), our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an inventory intermediation agreement with Citigroup Energy Inc. Citi (the Inventory Intermediation Agreement to support our Hawaii refining operations. Pursuant to the Inventory Intermediation Agreement, Citi will finance and hold title to crude oil in storage tanks and certain crude oil in transit to be consumed by PHR s refinery located in Kapolei, Hawaii (the Hawaii Refinery ). In connection with the Inventory Intermediation Agreement, Citi will enter into certain hedging transactions, in each case, on terms and subject to conditions set forth in the Inventory Intermediation Agreement. The net cash proceeds of million, presented as Proceeds from inventory financing agreements in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows, were used to settle a portion of PHR s outstanding obligations under the prior J. Aron intermediation agreement. 
 Upon entry into the Inventory Intermediation Agreement, Citi purchased from PHR all the crude oil held in its Hawaii storage tanks. Though title resides with Citi, the Inventory Intermediation Agreement is accounted for similar to a product financing arrangement and the crude oil inventories will continue to be included in our consolidated balance sheets until processed and sold to a third party. Monthly, we record a liability in an amount equal to the amount we expect to pay to repurchase the inventory held by Citi as, following expiration or termination of the Inventory Intermediation Agreement, we are obligated to purchase the crude oil then-owned by Citi at then-current market prices. 
 The Inventory Intermediation Agreement has a term of with a extension option upon mutual agreement. Par Petroleum, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, guarantees PHR s obligations under the Inventory Intermediation Agreement and certain other related agreements pursuant to an unsecured guaranty. In connection with the Inventory Intermediation Agreement, on May 31, 2024, PHR entered into a pledge and security agreement with Citi, which grants Citi a security interest on certain collateral to secure the obligations of PHR under the Inventory Intermediation Agreement. 
 The Inventory Intermediation Agreement also requires PHR to comply with certain covenants that restrict PHR s ability to take certain actions, including certain limitations on PHR s ability to incur debt and grant liens. 
 Supply and Offtake Agreement 
 Prior to May 31, 2024, we had a supply and offtake agreement with J. Aron Company, LLC J. Aron to support our Hawaii refining operations (the Supply and Offtake Agreement"). Under the Supply and Offtake Agreement, we paid or received certain fees from J. Aron based on changes in market prices over time. On May 31, 2024, the Supply and Offtake Agreement expired, the J. Aron Discretionary Draw Facility was terminated, and we entered into the Inventory Intermediation Agreement. We paid million and million to settle our J. Aron obligation and Discretionary Draw Facility remaining obligations, respectively. These payments are presented within Payments for termination of inventory financing agreements and Net repayments of deferred payment arrangements and receivable advances in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. In connection with the termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreement, we recognized termination costs of million, which are recorded in Debt extinguishment and commitment costs on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there were outstanding obligations under the Supply and Offtake Agreement.

 (1) Current assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their net realizable value. Other long-term assets includes preliminary costs for future turnarounds that were recently incurred and were recorded at their net realizable values. 
 (2) The fair value of personal property was estimated using the cost approach. Key assumptions in the cost approach include determining the replacement cost by evaluating recent purchases of comparable assets or published data, and adjusting replacement cost for economic and functional obsolescence, location, normal useful lives, and capacity (if applicable). The fair value of real property was estimated using the market approach. Key assumptions in the market approach include determining the asset value by evaluating recent purchases of comparable assets under similar circumstances. We consider this to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
 (3) Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities were recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term using the incremental borrowing rate at acquisition of . 
 (4) The fair value of our investments in YELP and YPLC were determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimated the present value of expected future cash flows using a market participant discount rate. Under the market approach, we estimated fair value using observable multiples for comparable companies in the investments industries. These valuation methods require us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, capital projects, commodity prices, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. We consider this to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
 (5) Environmental liabilities are based on management s best estimates of probable future costs using currently available information. We consider this to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
 Equity Method Investments 
 We evaluate equity method investments for impairment when factors indicate that a decrease in the value of our investment has occurred and the carrying amount of our investment may not be recoverable. An impairment loss, based on the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the investment, is recognized in earnings when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. 
 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 Derivative Instruments 
 We classify financial assets and liabilities according to the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 1 instruments are valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. These include our exchange traded futures. Level 2 instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Our Level 2 instruments include

We believe the Department of Revenue s interpretation is in conflict with its prior guidance and we appealed in November 2022. By opinion dated September 22, 2021, the Hawaii Attorney General reversed a prior 1964 opinion exempting various business transactions conducted in the Hawaii foreign trade zone from certain state taxes. We and other similarly situated state taxpayers who had previously claimed such exemptions, certain of which we are contractually obligated to indemnify, are currently being audited for such prior tax periods.

 Additionally, we believe the Wyoming refinery will need to modify or close a series of wastewater impoundments in the next several years and replace those impoundments with a new wastewater treatment system. Based on current information, reasonable estimates we have received suggest costs of approximately million to design and construct a new wastewater treatment system. 
 Finally, among the various historic consent decrees, orders, and settlement agreements into which Wyoming Refining has entered, there are several penalty orders associated with exceedances of permitted limits by the Wyoming refinery s wastewater discharges. Although the frequency of these exceedances has declined over time, Wyoming Refining may become subject to new penalty enforcement action in the next several years, which could involve penalties in excess of .

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Overview 
 We are a growing energy company based in Houston, Texas, that provides both renewable and conventional fuels to the western United States. For more information, please read Note 1 Overview to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Recent Events Affecting Comparability of Periods 
 Crude oil pricing decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Brent crude oil pricing averaged 78.71 per barrel in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 85.92 per barrel in the third quarter of 2023. Average U.S. retail gasoline prices remained relatively stable from 3.69 per gallon in 2023 to 3.51 per gallon in 2024. Refined product crack spreads decreased in 2024 as compared to 2023. The U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA in its September 2024 short term energy outlook forecasts average Brent crude oil pricing of 84 per barrel in 2025 due to strong global inventory draws in the first half of 2024 driven by less Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC production. In addition, the International Energy Agency IEA reduced its forecast for global oil demand in 2024 and 2025 in its October report. This is primarily driven by reduced demand in China. In 2023, OPEC announced several voluntary production cuts. Russia announced on February 10, 2023, that it would cut its oil production by 500,000 barrels a day (5 of its output), in response to imposed sanctions on the country s oil trade. In June 2023, OPEC extended oil output cuts of 3.66 million barrels a day, or about 5 of daily global demand, until the end of 2024, including a Russian cut in oil exports of 300,000 barrels a day until the end of 2023. In November 2023, OPEC announced additional voluntary production cuts of 1.7 million barrels a day, thus totaling about 2.2 million barrels a day, from January through March 2024. On March 3, 2024, OPEC announced an extension of its November 2023 voluntary production cut through June 2024, driving down supply, as demand increased due to spring and summer travel seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. On June 2, 2024, OPEC agreed to extend the latest cut of 2.2 million barrels a day until the end of September and gradually phase it out from October on a monthly basis. Additionally, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Red Sea region continued to escalate in 2024 putting upward pressure on prices. The overall effect of these conflicts and associated actions taken to limit the purchase of Russian petroleum products impacted freight movements and raised the operating costs of many European and other refineries. Energy prices are, among other factors, indicators of inflation. The overall energy price index increased 3.4 year over year as of September 30, 2024. While inflation has increased relative to the prior year, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations in 2024. Please read Item 1A. Risk Factors on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further information. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Income. Our financial results for the third quarter of 2024 declined from net income of 171.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by a 175.8 million decrease in our refining segment operating income and a 2.6 million increase in interest expense and financing costs, net, partially offset by a 5.5 million increase in our logistics segment operating income, a 5.0 million increase in our retail segment operating income, and a 4.7 million decrease in acquisition and integration expenses related to our Billings Acquisition. Please read the discussions of segment and consolidated results below for additional information. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA was 51.4 million compared to 255.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 204.3 million decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 208.4 million in refining segment Adjusted Gross Margin, partially offset by an increase of 4.4 million in our retail segment Adjusted Gross Margin. Please read the discussion of Adjusted Gross Margin by Segment and the Discussion of Consolidated Results below for additional information. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted Net Loss was 5.5 million compared to Adjusted Net Income of 193.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline was primarily related to the factors described above for the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA, combined with an increase of 1.9 million in interest expense and financing costs, excluding unrealized interest rate derivative losses (gains), partially offset by a decrease of 3.8 million in income tax expense and a decrease of 3.4 million in D A.

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Income. Our financial results declined from net income of 439.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 22.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was driven by a 419.3 million decrease in refining segment operating income, a 21.2 million increase in general and administrative expenses, a 9.7 million increase in Interest expense and financing costs, net, and a 7.8 million increase in Equity earnings from Laramie Energy, LLC, partially offset by a 17.1 million decrease in acquisitions and integration expenses related to our Billings Acquisition, a 16.3 million decrease in Debt extinguishment and commitment costs, and a 10.6 million increase in logistics segment operating income. Please read the discussions of segment and consolidated results below for additional information. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA was 227.7 million compared to 574.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 346.5 million decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 241.9 million in our refining segment Adjusted Gross Margin, a 114.2 million increase in operating expenses, a 21.2 million increase in General and administrative expense (excluding depreciation),partially offset by increases of 13.1 million and 6.5 million in our logistics and retail segment Adjusted Gross Margins, respectively. Please read the discussion of Adjusted Gross Margin by Segment and the Discussion of Consolidated Results below for additional information. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted Net Income was 64.7 million compared to 435.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline was primarily related to the same factors described above for the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA, combined with an increase of 9.4 million of interest expense and financing costs, excluding unrealized interest rate derivative losses (gains), an increase of 8.8 million of D A, and a decrease of 9.2 million of cash distributions received from Laramie Energy, LLC, partially offset by a decrease in Income tax expense, net of impacts due to changes in the valuation allowance and other deferred tax items of 5.5 million.

________________________________________________________ 
 (1) Feedstocks throughput and sales volumes per day for the Montana refinery for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are calculated based on the 92 and 122-day periods for which we owned the Montana refinery during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As such, the amounts for the total refining segment represent the sum of the Hawaii, Washington, and Wyoming refineries throughput or sales volumes averaged over the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, plus the Montana refinery s throughput or sales volumes averaged over the periods from July 1, 2023 to September 30, 2023 and June 1, 2023, to September 30, 2023, respectively. The 2024 amounts for the total refining segment represent the sum of the Hawaii, Montana, Washington, and Wyoming refineries throughput or sales volumes averaged over the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 (2) We calculate Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel by dividing Adjusted Gross Margin by total refining throughput. Adjusted Gross Margin for our Washington refinery is determined under the last-in, first-out LIFO inventory costing method. Adjusted Gross Margin for our other refineries is determined under the first-in, first-out FIFO inventory costing method. 
 (3) Management uses production costs per barrel to evaluate performance and compare efficiency to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate production costs per barrel; different companies within the industry calculate it in different ways. We calculate production costs per barrel by dividing all direct production costs, which include the costs to run the refineries including personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs, insurance, utilities, and other miscellaneous costs, by total refining throughput. Our production costs are included in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, which also includes costs related to our bulk marketing operations and severance costs. 
 (4) We believe the 3-1-2 Singapore Crack Spread (or three barrels of Brent crude oil converted into one barrel of gasoline and two barrels of distillates (diesel and jet fuel)) is the most representative market indicator for our operations in Hawaii. 
 (5) We believe the RVO Adjusted Pacific Northwest 3-1-1-1 Index (or three barrels of WTI crude oil converted into one barrel of Pacific Northwest gasoline, one barrel of Pacific Northwest ULSD and one barrel of USGC VGO, less 100 of the RVO cost for gasoline and ULSD) is the most representative market indicator for our operations in Washington. 
 (6) We believe the RVO Adjusted USGC 3-2-1 Index (or three barrels of WTI crude oil converted into two barrels of USGC gasoline and one barrel of USGC ULSD, less 100 of the RVO cost) is the most representative market indicator for our operations in Montana and Wyoming. 
 (7) ANS crude price influences the Hawaii Refinery s financial performance. Beginning in September 2024, the ANS index has been updated from a Platts marker to an Argus marker to better reflect the prompt ANS market. 
 
 Below is a summary of key operating statistics for the retail segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Retail Segment Retail sales volumes (thousands of gallons) 31,232 31,137 91,186 87,710 
 
 Non-GAAP Performance Measures 
 Management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes or alternatives to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies since each company may define these terms differently. 
 We believe Adjusted Gross Margin (as defined below) provides useful information to investors because it eliminates the gross impact of volatile commodity prices and adjusts for certain non-cash items and timing differences created by our inventory financing agreements and lower of cost and net realizable value adjustments to demonstrate the earnings potential of the business before other fixed and variable costs, which are reported separately in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) and Depreciation and amortization. Management uses Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel to evaluate operating performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry and to industry benchmarks. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) are useful supplemental financial measures that allow investors to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis, the ability of 
 38 

our assets to generate cash to pay interest on our indebtedness, and our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure. 
 Beginning with financial results reported for the second quarter of 2023, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted EBITDA also exclude our portion of interest, taxes, and depreciation expense from our refining and logistics investments acquired on June 1, 2023, as part of the Billings Acquisition. 
 Beginning with financial results reported for the fourth quarter of 2023, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted EBITDA excludes all hedge losses (gains) associated with our Washington ending inventory and LIFO layer increment impacts associated with our Washington inventory. In addition, we have modified our environmental obligation mark-to-market adjustment to include only the mark-to-market losses (gains) associated with our net RINs liability and net obligation associated with the Washington Climate Commitment Act Washington CCA and Clean Fuel Standard. This modification was made as part of our change in how we estimate our environmental obligation liabilities. 
 Beginning with financial results reported for the fourth quarter of 2023, Adjusted Net Income (loss) excludes unrealized interest rate derivative losses (gains) and all Laramie Energy related impacts with the exception of cash distributions. We have recast Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for prior periods when reported to conform to the modified presentation. 
 Beginning with financial results reported for the first quarter of 2024, Adjusted Net Income (loss) also excludes other non-operating income and expenses. This modification improves comparability between periods by excluding income and expenses resulting from non-operating activities. 
 Adjusted Gross Margin 
 Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as operating income (loss) excluding: 
 operating expense (excluding depreciation); 
 depreciation and amortization D A 
 Par s portion of interest, taxes, and depreciation expense from refining and logistics investments; 
 impairment expense; 
 loss (gain) on sale of assets, net; 
 inventory valuation adjustment (which adjusts for timing differences to reflect the economics of our inventory financing agreements, including lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, the impact of the embedded derivative repurchase or terminal obligations, hedge losses (gains) associated with our Washington ending inventory and intermediation obligation, purchase price allocation adjustments, and LIFO layer increment and decrement impacts associated with our Washington inventory); 
 Environmental obligation mark-to-market adjustment (which represents the mark-to-market losses (gains) associated with our net RINs liability and our net obligation associated with the Washington Climate Commitment Act and Clean Fuel Standard); and 
 unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives. 

The following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, operating income (loss), on a historical basis, for selected segments, for the periods indicated (in thousands):

 Discussion of Consolidated Results 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were 2.1 billion, a 0.5 billion decrease compared to 2.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 0.3 billion decrease to refining revenue reflecting lower average product crack spreads discussed below, 0.1 billion due to lower crude oil prices also discussed below. These lower average crack spreads are reflective of larger market trends. The IEA s September 2024 report noted a slowdown in global and U.S. oil demand growth post-pandemic and its October 2024 report noted declining refining margins, primarily driven by reduced demand in China. The RVO Adjusted Pacific Northwest 3-1-1-1 index, 3-1-2 Singapore Crack Spread, and RVO Adjusted USGC 3-2-1 index declined 56 , 53 , and 52 , respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Average WTI crude oil prices decreased 8 and average Brent crude oil prices decreased 8 as compared to the prior period. Please read our key operating statistics for further information. Revenues at our retail segment decreased 8.3 million primarily due to an 8 decline in fuel sales prices. 
 Cost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) was 1.9 billion, a decrease of 0.3 billion when compared to 2.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower crude oil prices, as discussed above, a favorable change of 0.1 billion related to the termination of the Washington Refinery Intermediation Agreement and Supply and Offtake Agreement, and favorable derivative activity of 0.1 billion, partially offset by 0.1 billion of unfavorable FIFO impacts. Please read Note 9 Inventory Financing Agreements for more information on the Washington Refinery Intermediation Agreement and Supply and Offtake Agreement terminations. 
 Operating Expense (Excluding Depreciation). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating expense (excluding depreciation) was 147.0 million, a 1.8 million increase when compared to 145.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our debt maturities and debt service requirements and contractual obligations, capital expenditures, turnaround outlays, and working capital needs. Examples of working capital needs include purchases and sales of commodities and associated margin and collateral requirements, facility maintenance costs, and other costs such as payroll. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand, amounts available under our credit agreements, and access to capital markets. 
 Our liquidity position as of September 30, 2024 was 632.5 million, consisting of 183.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and 449.5 million of availability under the ABL Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had access to the ABL Credit Facility and cash on hand of 183.0 million. Generally, the primary uses of our capital resources have been in the operations of our refining and retail segments, payments related to acquisitions, and to repay or refinance indebtedness. 
 During the second quarter of 2024 our Supply and Offtake Agreement with J.Aron expired and we entered into an Inventory Intermediation Agreement with Citi. We also early terminated our LC Facility. In the first quarter of 2024, we amended our asset-based loan to permit expanding its capacity from 900 million to 1.4 billion as we planned for the refinancing of our Supply and Offtake Agreement. We believe our cash flows from operations and available capital resources will be sufficient to meet our current capital and turnaround expenditures, working capital, and debt service requirements for the next 12 months. We may seek to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund acquisitions and any other significant changes to our business or to refinance existing debt. We cannot offer any assurances that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost. 
 We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our common stock through cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. The Term Loan Credit Agreement may also require annual prepayments of principal with a variable percentage of our excess cash flow, 50 or 25 depending on our consolidated year end secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement). 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes cash activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 99,242 581,445 Net cash used in investing activities (86,319) (631,752) Net cash used in financing activities (109,047) (79,039) 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily b y net income of 22.4 million , non-cash charges to operations and non-operating items of approximately 172.6 million, and net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 95.7 million. Non-cash charges to operations and non-operating items consisted primarily of the following adjustments: 
 unrealized loss on derivatives contracts of 33.8 million, 
 depreciation and amortization expenses of 96.7 million, and 
 stock based compensation expenses of 22.5 million. 
 
 56 

Net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from: 
 an 82.5 million decrease in Obligations under inventory financing agreements primarily related to the termination of the J. Aron Supply and Offtake agreement and a decrease in crude oil prices, 
 an increase in deferred turnaround expenditures of 57.8 million driven by expenditures related to the turnaround at the Montana refinery, and 
 a 57.2 million increase in accounts receivable primarily related to the timing of collections and sales volumes, 
 partially offset by: a 72.7 million decrease in inventories primarily related to a 51.8 million decrease in crude oil and feedstock ending inventory, and 
 a 24.8 million decreases in prepaid and other expenses. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of: 
 87.9 million in additions to property, plant, and equipment driven by maintenance projects at our refineries and various profit improvement projects 
 partially offset by: a 1.5 million cash distribution received from Laramie Energy in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was approximately 109.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of the following activities: 
 payments of 547.6 million for changes in our deferred payment arrangement and the termination of our inventory financing agreement related to the expiration of our Supply and Offtake Agreement in the second quarter of 2024, 
 repurchases of common stock of 126.7 million, and 
 partially offset by: net borrowings of debt of 370.0 million primarily driven by activity in our ABL Credit Facility, and 
 proceeds of 203.1 million received related to the step-in of the Inventory Intermediation Agreement in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was driven primarily by net income of 439.3 million, non-cash charges to operations and non-operating items of approximately 106.4 million, and net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 35.7 million. Non-cash charges to operations consisted primarily of the following adjustments: 
 depreciation and amortization expenses of 87.9 million, 
 debt commitment and extinguishment costs of 17.7 million, 
 stock based compensation costs of 9.0 million, 
 partially offset by: a gain of 10.7 million from our equity investment in Laramie Energy. 
 
 Net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from: 
 an increase in our accounts payable primarily driven by the contribution of our Billings business, and 
 a decrease in inventory driven by lower crude oil and refined product prices, lower inventory volumes, and a decrease in RINs assets at our Hawaii and Wyoming refineries, 
 
 57 

an increase in our accounts payable primarily driven by the contribution of our Billings business, and 
 partially offset by: an increase in our accounts receivable primarily driven by the contribution of our Billings Acquisition and higher accounts receivable balances across our legacy refining portfolio, and 
 a decrease in gross environmental credit obligations primarily related to retirements of a portion of our prior year obligations, partially offset by increased current period obligation. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of: 
 595.4 million for the Billings Acquisition, and 
 53.7 million in additions to property, plant, and equipment driven by maintenance projects at our refineries and various profit improvement projects, including construction of a flagship retail store in Washington, improved crude processing equipment at our Hawaii refinery, a co-processing unit at our Tacoma refinery, and various IT infrastructure improvements, 
 partially offset by: 
 a 10.7 million cash distribution received from Laramie Energy in the first quarter of 2023. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was approximately 79.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted primarily of the following activities: 
 net repayments under the J. Aron Discretionary Draw Facility and MLC receivable advances of 52.4 million, and 
 repurchases of common stock of 32.2 million, 
 partially offset by: net borrowings of debt of 12.7 million primarily driven by the refinancing and consolidation of our debt. 
 
 Cash Requirements. There have been no material changes to the cash requirements disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, outside the ordinary course of business except as follows: 
 Debt Refinancing. On March 22, 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment to the ABL Credit Facility, conditional upon the termination of the Company s existing intermediation agreement with J. Aron, to among other things, increase our total revolver commitment to 1.4 billion. On May 31, 2024, we entered into the Inventory Intermediation Agreement with Citi. Pursuant to the Inventory Intermediation Agreement, Citi will purchase and deliver crude oil to PHR for use at its refinery located in Kapolei, Hawaii. The Inventory Intermediation Agreement replaces the Supply and Offtake Agreement between PHR and J. Aron that was terminated on May 31, 2024. Please read Note 9 Inventory Financing Agreements and Note 11 Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to critical accounting estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute forward-looking statements as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 PSLRA ), or in releases made by the SEC, all of which may be amended from time to time. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors including, without limitation, the Russia-Ukraine war, Israel-Palestine conflict, Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, Iranian activities in the Strait of Hormuz and certain developments in the global crude oil markets, on our business, our customers, and the markets where we operate; our beliefs regarding available capital resources; our beliefs regarding the likely results or impact of certain disputes or contingencies and any potential fines or penalties; our beliefs regarding the fair value of certain assets, and our expectations with respect to laws and regulations, including 
 58 

environmental regulations and related compliance costs and any fines or penalties related thereto; our expectations regarding the sufficiency of our cash flows and liquidity; our expectations regarding anticipated capital expenditures, including the timing and cost of compliance with consent decrees and other enforcement actions; our expectations regarding the impact of the adoption of certain accounting standards; our estimates regarding the fair value of certain indebtedness; estimated costs to settle claims from the Delta bankruptcy; the estimated value of, and our ability to settle, legal claims remaining to be settled against third parties; our expectations regarding the synergies or other benefits of our acquisitions; our expectations regarding certain tax liabilities and debt obligations; management s assumptions about the impact of future events on our existing business, the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the recently acquired ExxonMobil Billings refinery and associated marketing and logistics assets (the Acquisition ), including renewable growth opportunities; the anticipated financial and operating results of the Acquisition, and the effect on the Company s cash flows and profitability (including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income); our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital; our ability to make strategic investments in business opportunities; and the estimates, assumptions, and projections regarding future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. These and other forward-looking statements could cause the actual results, performance, or achievements of Par and its subsidiaries to differ materially from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Statements that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking language, such as the words plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, project, may, will, would, could, should, seeks, or scheduled to, or other similar words, or the negative of these terms or other variations of these terms or comparable language, or by discussion of strategy or intentions. These cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the PSLRA with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of such laws. 
 The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are largely based on our expectations, which reflect estimates and assumptions made by our management. These estimates and assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions and other factors. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control, including those set out in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under Risk Factors. 
 In addition, management s assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate. All readers are cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are not guarantees of future performance; and we cannot assure any reader that such statements will be realized or that the forward-looking events and circumstances will occur. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements due to factors described above and under Critical Accounting Estimates and Risk Factors included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. There can be no guarantee that the operational and financial measures the Company has taken, and may take in the future, will be fully effective. We do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. 
 
 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Our earnings, cash flows, and liquidity are significantly affected by commodity price volatility. Our Revenues fluctuate with refined product prices and our Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) fluctuates with movements in crude oil and feedstock prices. Assuming all other factors remain constant, a 1 per barrel change in average gross refining margins, based on our throughput for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 198 Mbpd, would change annualized operating income by approximately 71.4 million. This analysis may differ from actual results. 
 In order to manage commodity price risks, we utilize exchange-traded futures, OTC options, and OTC swaps associated with: 
 the price for which we sell our refined products; 
 the price we pay for crude oil and other feedstocks; 
 our crude oil and refined products inventory; and 
 our fuel requirements for our refineries. 
 Substantially all of our futures and OTC swaps are executed to economically hedge our physical commodity purchases, sales, and inventory. All our open futures and OTC swaps at September 30, 2024, will settle by April 2026. Based 
 59 

on our net open positions at September 30, 2024, a 1 change in the price of crude oil, assuming all other factors remain constant, would result in a change of approximately 5.7 million to the fair value of these derivative instruments and Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation). 
 Our predominant variable operating cost is the cost of fuel consumed in the refining process, which is included in Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we consumed approximatel y 198.4 Mbpd and 186.3 Mbpd, respectively, of crude oil during the refining process across all our refineries. We internally consumed approximately 4 of this throughput in the refining process during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is accounted for as a fuel cost. We have executed option collars to economically hedge our internally consumed fuel cost at all our refineries. Please read Note 12 Derivatives to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 
 Compliance Program Price Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of RINs required to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard. Our RVO is based on a percentage of our Hawaii, Wyoming, Washington, and Montana refineries production of on-road transportation fuel. The EPA sets the RVO percentages annually. On June 21, 2023, the EPA finalized the 2023, 2024, and 2025 RVOs. To the degree we are unable to blend the required amount of biofuels to satisfy our RVO, we must purchase RINs on the open market. To mitigate the impact of this risk on our results of operations and cash flows, we may purchase RINs when we deem the price of these instruments to be favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments, however, we elect the normal purchases normal sales exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. 
 Additionally, we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of compliance credits required to comply with Washington CCA and Clean Fuel Standard. To the extent we are unable to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation fuels we sell in Washington, we must purchase compliance credits at auction or in the open market. The number of credits required to comply with the Washington CCA and Clean Fuel Standard is based on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation fuels we sell in Washington compared to certain regulatory limits. To mitigate the impact of this risk on our results of operations and cash flows, we may purchase credits when we deem the price to be favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments and recorded at their fair value. Please read Note 12 Derivatives for more information. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.1 billion in debt principal that was subject to floating interest rates. We also had interest rate exposure in connection with our liabilities under the Inventory Intermediation Agreement for which we pay charges based on the three-month SOFR. An increase of 1 in the variable rate on our indebtedness, after considering the instruments subject to minimum interest rates, would result in an increase to our Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) and Interest expense and financing costs, net, of approximately 1.8 million and 10.6 million per year, respectively. We may utilize interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2024 we had entered into an interest rate collar at a cap of 5.50 and floor of 2.30 , based on the three month SOFR as of the fixing date. This swap expires on May 31, 2026. Please read Note 12 Derivatives for more information. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our counterparties. We will continue to closely monitor the creditworthiness of customers to whom we grant credit and establish credit limits in accordance with our credit policy. 
 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.
