EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the unaudited quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 of Tanger Inc., a North Carolina corporation, and Tanger Properties Limited Partnership, a North Carolina limited partnership. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term Company refers to Tanger Inc. and subsidiaries and the term Operating Partnership refers to Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries. The terms we , our and us refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership together, as the context requires. 
 
 The Company is one of the leading owners and operators of outlet and open-air retail centers in the United States and Canada. The Company is a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust REIT ), which, through its controlling interest in the Operating Partnership, focuses on developing, acquiring, owning, operating and managing outlet and open-air shopping centers. The shopping centers and other assets are held by, and all of the operations are conducted by, the Operating Partnership. Accordingly, the descriptions of the business, employees and properties of the Company are also descriptions of the business, employees and properties of the Operating Partnership. As the Operating Partnership is the issuer of our registered debt securities, we are required to present a separate set of financial statements for this entity. 
 
 The Company, including its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tanger LP Trust, owns the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership. The Company controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner. Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries owned 110,208,387 units of the Operating Partnership and other limited partners (the Non-Company LPs collectively owned 4,707,958 Class A common limited partnership units. Each Class A common limited partnership unit held by the Non-Company LPs is exchangeable for one of the Company s common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company s status as a REIT. Class B common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership, which are held by Tanger LP Trust, are not exchangeable for common shares of the Company. 

Management operates the Company and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. The management of the Company consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. These individuals are officers of the Company and employees of the Operating Partnership. 
 
 We believe combining the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company and the Operating Partnership into this single Quarterly Report provides the following benefits: 
 
 enhancing investors understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 
 eliminating duplicative disclosure and providing a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Company and the Operating Partnership; and 
 
 creating time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined Quarterly Report instead of two separate Quarterly Reports. 
 
 There are only a few differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, which are reflected in the disclosure in this Quarterly Report. We believe it is important, however, to understand these differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how the Company and the Operating Partnership operate as an interrelated consolidated company. 
 
 As stated above, the Company is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership, including through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tanger LP Trust. As a result, the Company does not conduct business itself, other than issuing public equity from time to time and incurring expenses required to operate as a public company. However, all operating expenses incurred by the Company are reimbursed by the Operating Partnership, thus the only material item on the Company s income statement is its equity in the earnings of the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by the Company. The Company itself does not hold any indebtedness but does guarantee certain debt of the Operating Partnership, as disclosed in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 The Operating Partnership holds all of the shopping centers and other assets, including the ownership interests in consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by the Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required through its operations, its incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of partnership units. 
 
 Noncontrolling interests, shareholders equity and partners capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership held by the Non-Company LPs are accounted for as partners capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in the Company s financial statements. 
 
 To help investors understand the significant differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this Quarterly Report presents the following separate sections for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership: 
 
 Consolidated financial statements; 
 
 The following notes to the consolidated financial statements: 
 
 Debt of the Company and the Operating Partnership; 
 
 Shareholders Equity and Partners Equity; 
 
 Earnings Per Share and Earnings Per Unit; 
 
 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income of the Company and the Operating Partnership; and 
 2 

Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 This Quarterly Report also includes separate Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and Exhibit 32 certifications for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer of each entity have made the requisite certifications and that the Company and Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and 18 U.S.C. 1350. 
 
 The separate sections in this Quarterly Report for the Company and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to the Company and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosure of the Company and the Operating Partnership, this Quarterly Report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that enters into contracts and joint ventures and holds assets and debt, reference to the Company is appropriate because the business is one enterprise and the Company operates the business through the Operating Partnership. 
 
 The Company currently consolidates the Operating Partnership because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnership that most significantly impact the Operating Partnership s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive the residual returns of the Operating Partnership that could be potentially significant. The separate discussions of the Company and the Operating Partnership in this Quarterly Report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company.

years. Management has the intent, and we have the ability, to hold the property for at least this period, and we believe this period is reasonable based on the center s performance and our history of being a long-term owner and operator of our centers. We believe the carrying value is recoverable because in our models the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, million, and the estimated potential disposition proceeds of the sale of the center, million (in aggregate totaling million) exceeds the carrying value of million by million. The recorded carrying amount includes intangible lease costs from our 2011 acquisition of the center. 
 
 We will continue to monitor circumstances and events in future periods that could affect inputs such as the expected holding period, operating cash flow forecasts and capitalization rates, utilized to determine whether an impairment charge is necessary. As these inputs are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analysis may not be achieved, and actual losses or impairment may be realized in the future. If in the future we reduce our estimate of cash flow projections, we may need to record an asset impairment. We have not materially changed the assumptions used in the analysis during the first nine months of 2024. However, we can provide no assurance that material impairment charges with respect to our properties will not occur in future periods.

 Fair values of interest rate swaps are estimated using Level 2 inputs based on current market data received from financial sources that trade such instruments and are based on prevailing market data and derived from third party proprietary models based on well recognized financial principles including counterparty risks, credit spreads and interest rate projections, as well as reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions.

 Our senior unsecured notes are publicly-traded which provides quoted market rates. However, due to the limited trading volume of these notes, we have classified these instruments as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Our other debt is classified as Level 3 given the unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation. Our unsecured term loan, unsecured lines of credit and variable interest rate mortgages are all SOFR based instruments. When selecting the discount rates for purposes of estimating the fair value of these instruments, we evaluated the original credit spreads and do not believe that the use of them differs materially from current credit spreads for similar instruments and therefore the recorded values of these debt instruments is considered their fair value.

 At-the-Market Offering 
 
 Under our at-the-market stock offering ATM Offering program, which commenced February 2021, and was replaced with a new program in December 2023, we may offer and sell our common shares, par value per share, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to million. We may sell the common shares in amounts and at times to be determined by us but we have no obligation to sell any of the common shares. Actual sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of the common shares, capital needs and determinations by us of the appropriate sources of its funding. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of common shares pursuant to the ATM Offering program for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately million of common shares remaining available for sale under the ATM Offering program.

 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 In May 2023, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to million of the Company s outstanding common shares through May 31, 2025, replacing the previously authorized plan to repurchase up to million of the Company's outstanding common shares through May 31, 2023. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market, privately-negotiated, structured or derivative transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions), or other methods of acquiring common shares. The Company intends to structure open market purchases to occur within pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Company may, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate the repurchase of its common shares under this authorization. The Company did repurchase any common shares in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The remaining amount of common shares authorized to be repurchased under the program as of September 30, 2024 was approximately million.

 We determine diluted earnings per share based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding combined with the incremental weighted average shares that would have been outstanding assuming all potentially dilutive securities were converted into common shares at the earliest date possible. 
 
 Notional units granted under our equity compensation plan are considered contingently issuable common shares and are included in earnings per share if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method and the common shares would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately notional units were excluded from the computation because these notional units either would not have been issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period or as they were anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, notional units were excluded from the computation. 
 
 With respect to outstanding options, the effect of dilutive common shares is determined using the treasury stock method, whereby outstanding options are assumed exercised at the beginning of the reporting period and the exercise proceeds from such options and the average measured but unrecognized compensation cost during the period are assumed to be used to repurchase our common shares at the average market price during the period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, options were excluded from the computation and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately and options, respectively, were excluded from the computation as they were anti-dilutive. 
 
 The assumed exchange of the partnership units held by the Non-Company LPs as of the beginning of the year, which would result in the elimination of earnings allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership, would have no impact on earnings per share since the allocation of earnings to a common limited partnership unit, as if exchanged, is equivalent to earnings allocated to a common share. 
 
 Certain of the Company s unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. The impact of these unvested restricted common share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted common share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted common shares participation rights in undistributed earnings. Unvested restricted common shares that do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are included in the diluted earnings per share computation if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.

 Certain of the Company s unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents. The impact of the corresponding unvested restricted unit awards on earnings per unit has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted unit awards based on distributions declared and the unvested restricted units participation rights in undistributed earnings.

 During February 2024, the Company granted approximately restricted common shares to the Company s non-employee directors and the Company s executive officers. The grant date fair value of the awards was per share. The restricted common shares vest ratably over a period on February 15th of each year for executive officers and over a period on February 15th for non-employee directors. Compensation expense related to the amortization of the deferred compensation is being recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule of the restricted shares. 
 
 For certain restricted shares that vest and restricted share units that are settled during the period, we withhold shares with value equivalent up to the employees maximum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remit cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total number of shares withheld upon vesting or settlement were approximately and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total number of shares withheld was based on the value of the common shares on the vesting or settlement date as determined by our closing share price on the prior day. Total amounts paid for the employees tax obligation to taxing authorities were million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are reflected as financing activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows.

restricted common shares may be earned if certain share price appreciation goals are achieved over a measurement period. The 2024 PSP is a long-term incentive compensation plan. Recipients may earn units which may convert into restricted common shares of the Company based on the Company s absolute share price appreciation (or absolute total shareholder return) and its share price appreciation relative to its peer group (or relative total shareholder return) over a measurement period. Any shares earned at the end of the measurement period are subject to a time-based vesting schedule, with of the shares vesting immediately following the measurement period, and the remaining vesting thereafter, contingent upon continued employment with the Company through the vesting date (unless terminated prior thereto (a) by the Company without cause, (b) by participant for good reason or, (c) due to death or disability).

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 NET INCOME 
 Net income decreased approximately 3.0 million in the 2024 period to 25.9 million as compared to net income of 28.9 million for the 2023 period. Significant items impacting the comparability of the two periods include the following: 
 
 higher rental revenues from a strengthened tenant mix and higher new and renewal rental rates and the opening of our center in Nashville, TN and the acquisition of centers in Huntsville, AL and Asheville, NC during the fourth quarter of 2023 
 higher operating expenses, depreciation and amortization from the new centers 
 higher interest expense from newly effective variable interest rate swaps in 2024 
 lower investment income during 2024 due to much lower cash balances compared to the 2023 period as the cash was used to acquire centers in Huntsville, AL and Asheville, NC and to complete the development of our center in Nashville, TN 
 
 In the tables below, information set forth for new developments and acquired properties includes our center in Nashville, TN that opened in October of 2023 and our centers in Asheville, NC and Huntsville, AL that were acquired in November of 2023. 
 
 RENTAL REVENUES

 Rental revenues at existing properties were positively impacted by obtaining higher rents from new and existing tenants during the last twelve months and strengthening our tenant mix. 
 
 MANAGEMENT, LEASING AND OTHER SERVICES 
 Management, leasing and other services increased approximately 348,000 in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of management, leasing and other services (in thousands):

 Management and leasing fee income increased in the 2024 period due to our addition of property management responsibilities for centers in Palm Beach, Florida. 
 
 44 

OTHER REVENUES 
 Other revenues increased approximately 922,000 in the 2024 period as compared to the 2023 period. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of other revenues (in thousands): 
 2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease) Other revenues from existing properties 4,773 4,373 400 Other revenues from new developments and acquired properties 522 522 5,295 4,373 922 
 
 Other revenues from existing properties increased in the 2024 period due to an increase in other revenue streams, such as Tanger Loyalty program, paid media sponsorships and onsite signage, on a local and national level. 
 
 PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES 
 Property operating expenses increased approximately 3.5 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of property operating expenses (in thousands): 
 2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease) Property operating expenses from existing properties 34,176 34,757 (581) Property operating expenses from new developments and acquired properties 
 3,735 159 3,576 Expenses related to unconsolidated joint ventures 1,369 1,197 172 Other property operating expenses 967 645 322 40,247 36,758 3,489 
 
 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
 General and administrative expenses decreased approximately 722,000 from 18.9 million to 18.2 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The decrease is due primarily to reduced executive share-based compensation expense and lower third-party professional fees. 
 
 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION 
 Depreciation and amortization costs increased approximately 10.0 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period.

 The increase in depreciation and amortization from existing properties is primarily due to increased depreciation from second generation tenant allowances. 
 
 INTEREST EXPENSE 
 Interest expense increased 3.8 million to 15.5 million in the 2024 period from 11.7 million in the 2023 period. The increase was primarily due to the 325.0 million of Daily SOFR interest rate swaps that we entered into throughout 2023 that became effective on February 1, 2024 at average fixed pay rate of 3.90 . These swaps replaced 300.0 million of existing swaps that expired on February 1, 2024, which had an average fixed pay rate of 0.40 . In addition, we had outstanding balances averaging approximately 15.4 million on our lines of credit during the 2024 period. No amounts were outstanding on our lines of credit during the 2023 period. Finally, our Nashville, TN property opened during the fourth quarter of 2023 and therefore we did not capitalize interest costs related to it in the 2024 period as we did during the 2023 period. 

45 

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) 
 Other income (expense) decreased approximately 2.0 million from 1.9 million to 52,000) in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The 2023 period had higher investment income due to higher cash balances than were available in the 2024 period. The majority of the cash balances were utilized during the fourth quarter of 2023 for the acquisitions of the Asheville, NC and Huntsville, AL centers. In addition, cash was utilized throughout 2023 to complete the construction of our Nashville, TN center which opened in October 2023. 
 
 EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately 77,000 from 2.4 million from 2.3 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The decrease is primarily related to higher depreciation at two of our joint venture centers.

These swaps replaced 300.0 million of existing swaps that expired on February 1, 2024 which had an average fixed pay rate of 0.40 .

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY 
 
 In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company section, the term the Company refers only to Tanger Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding the Operating Partnership. 
 
 The Company s business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership. The Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company, which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership. The Company does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. The Company s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common shares. The Company s principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership. 
 
 Through its status as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and control. The Company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute all, or such portion as the Company may in its discretion determine, of its available cash in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement. The Company receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but is required by the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units of the Operating Partnership. 
 
 48 

We are a well-known seasoned issuer (as defined in the Securities Act) with a shelf registration that expires in December 2026 that allows the Company to register unspecified, various classes of equity securities and the Operating Partnership to register unspecified, various classes of debt securities. We expect to file a new joint shelf registration statement on Form S-3 prior to the expiration of the current registration statement. As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, to develop new or existing properties, to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties, to invest in existing or newly created joint ventures or for general corporate purposes. 
 
 The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership s ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company. The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company. The Company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership s debt. If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements, which trigger the Company s guarantee obligations, then the Company may be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. However, the Company s only material asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership. 
 
 The Company believes the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, cash on hand and, if necessary from time to time, borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the Company and, in turn, for the Company to make its dividend payments to its shareholders and to finance its continued operations, investment and growth strategy and additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that the Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the Company. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership's ability to pay its distributions to the Company, which will in turn, adversely affect the Company's ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. Risks are detailed in Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. For the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it must pay dividends to its shareholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its taxable income. While historically the Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its shareholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the Company's own shares. 
 
 As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can. The Company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the Operating Partnership s working capital needs, as well as potential new developments, expansions and renovations of existing properties, acquisitions, or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures. 
 
 The Company currently consolidates the Operating Partnership because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnership that most significantly impact the Operating Partnership s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive the residual returns of the Operating Partnership that could be potentially significant. The Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by the Company. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the Operating Partnership level, and the Company has guaranteed some of the Operating Partnership s unsecured debt as discussed below. Because the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole.

ATM Offering Program 
 
 Under our ATM Offering program, which commenced in February 2021, and was replaced with a new program in December 2023, we may offer and sell our common shares, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 250.0 million. We may sell the common shares in amounts and at times to be determined by us but we have no obligation to sell any of the common shares. Actual sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of the common shares, capital needs and determinations by us of the appropriate sources of its funding. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from any sale of common shares pursuant to the ATM Offering program for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 195.1 million remaining available for sale under our ATM Offering program. 
 
 The following table sets forth information regarding issuances under our ATM Offering program: 
 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Number of common shares settled during the period 818,943 106,615 818,943 106,615 Average price per share 30.53 24.89 30.53 24.89 Aggregate gross proceeds (in thousands) 25,000 2,654 25,000 2,654 Aggregate net proceeds after commissions and fees (in thousands) 24,687 2,621 24,687 2,621 
 
 In October 2024, we issued an additional 484,741 common shares under our ATM Offering program, at an average share price of 33.38 per share, yielding approximately 16.2 million of gross proceeds. 
 
 Share Buyback Program 
 
 In May 2023, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 100.0 million of the Company s outstanding shares through May 31, 2025. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market, privately-negotiated, structured or derivative transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions), or other methods of acquiring common shares. The Company intends to structure open market purchases to occur within pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18. The Company may, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate the repurchase of its common shares under this authorization. The Company did not repurchase any shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. The remaining amount of common shares authorized to be repurchased under the program as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 100 million. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 In January 2024, the Board declared a 0.26 cash dividend per common share payable on February 15, 2024 to each shareholder of record on January 31, 2023, and in its capacity as General Partner of the Operating Partnership, authorized a 0.26 cash distribution per Operating Partnership unit to the Operating Partnership's unitholders. 
 
 In April 2024, the Board declared a 0.275 cash dividend per common share payable on May 15, 2024 to each shareholder of record on April 30, 2024, and in its capacity as General Partner of the Operating Partnership, authorized a 0.275 cash distribution per Operating Partnership unit to the Operating Partnership's unitholders. 
 
 In July 2024, the Board declared a 0.275 cash dividend per common share payable on August 15, 2024 to each shareholder of record on July 31, 2024, and in its capacity as General Partner of the Operating Partnership, authorized a 0.275 cash distribution per Operating Partnership unit to the Operating Partnership's unitholders. 
 
 In October 2024, the Board declared a 0.275 cash dividend per common share payable on November 15, 2024 to each shareholder on record on October 31, 2024, and in its capacity as General Partner of the Operating Partnership, authorized a 0.275 cash distribution per Operating Partnership unit to the Operating Partnership s unitholders.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP 
 
 In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership section, the terms we , our and us refer to the Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership and the Company together, as the text requires. 
 
 Summary of Our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 General Overview 
 Property rental income represents our primary source to pay property operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and distributions, excluding non-recurring capital expenditures, redevelopments, and acquisitions. To the extent that our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to cover such non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions, we finance such activities from cash on hand, borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit, to the extent available, or from the proceeds from the Operating Partnership s debt offerings and the Company s equity offerings. 
 
 We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt and interest rate hedging strategies, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio. We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements, including without limitation, cash on hand, retained cash flow from operations and debt and equity issuances. 
 
 Our ability to access capital on favorable terms could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates and inflation, geopolitical conflict and other risks detailed in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The following table details our capital expenditures for consolidated centers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Nine months ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Change Capital expenditures analysis: New developments and expansions (1) 
 19,036 95,054 (76,018) Renovations 5,378 3,945 1,433 Second generation tenant allowances 20,858 7,606 13,252 Other capital expenditures (2) 
 18,329 23,531 (5,202) 63,601 130,136 (66,535) Conversion from accrual to cash basis 9,829 (10,066) 19,895 Additions to rental property-cash basis 73,430 120,070 (46,640) 
 (1) The decrease in new center developments and expansions is primarily due to development costs at our site in Nashville, TN and other projects in the prior year. 
 (2) Other capital expenditures in 2024 decreased over the 2023 period due to a lower number of major capital expenditure projects within our existing portfolio. 
 
 51 

Potential Future Developments and Acquisitions 
 We intend to continue to grow our portfolio by developing, expanding or acquiring additional outlet and retail real estate assets. Future real estate assets may be wholly-owned by us, owned through joint ventures or partnership arrangements, or managed through management agreements. However, you should note that any developments or expansions that we, or a joint venture that we have an ownership interest in, have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled, or may not result in accretive net income or funds from operations ("FFO"). See the section "Non-GAAP Supplemental Earnings Measures" - "Funds From Operations" below for further discussion of FFO. In addition, we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties. We may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties. Any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated. 
 
 As of the date of this filing, we are not in the pre-development period for any other new developments. We may use joint venture arrangements to develop potential sites. 
 
 In the case of projects to be wholly-owned by us, we expect to fund these projects with cash on hand, borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit and cash flows from operations, but may also fund them with capital from additional public debt and equity offerings. For projects to be developed through joint venture arrangements, we may use collateralized construction loans to fund a portion of the project, with our share of the equity requirements funded from sources described above. 
 
 Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures 
 From time to time, we form joint venture arrangements to develop centers. As of September 30, 2024 we have partial ownership interests in six unconsolidated centers totaling approximately 2.1 million square feet, including two centers in Canada. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details of our individual joint ventures, including, but not limited to, carrying values of our investments, fees we receive for services provided to the joint ventures, recent development and financing transactions and condensed combined summary financial information. 
 
 We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such funding is not typically required contractually or otherwise. We separately report investments in joint ventures for which accumulated distributions have exceeded investments in, and our share of net income or loss of, the joint ventures within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets because we are committed and intend to provide further financial support to these joint ventures. We believe our joint ventures will be able to fund their operating and capital needs for the next twelve months based on their sources of working capital, specifically cash flow from operations, access to contributions from partners, and ability to refinance debt obligations, including the ability to exercise upcoming extensions of near term maturities. 
 
 Our joint ventures are typically encumbered by a mortgage on the joint venture property. We provide guarantees to lenders for our joint ventures, which include standard non-recourse carve out indemnifications for losses arising from items such as but not limited to fraud, physical waste, payment of taxes, environmental indemnities, misapplication of insurance proceeds or security deposits and failure to maintain required insurance. A default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under the guaranty. For secured term loans, we may include a guaranty of completion as well as principal. Our joint ventures may contain make whole provisions in the event that demands are made on any existing guarantees. 
 
 Our joint ventures are generally subject to buy-sell provisions that are customary for joint venture agreements in the real estate industry. Either partner may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up period), which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or additional borrowings to acquire the other party's interest. Under these provisions, one partner sets a price for the property, then the other partner has the option to either (1) purchase their partner's interest based on that price or (2) sell its interest to the other partner based on that price. Since the partner other than the partner who triggers the provision has the option to be the buyer or seller, we do not consider this arrangement to be a mandatory redeemable obligation. 
 
 52 

Contractual Obligations 
 
 There were no material changes in our contractual commitments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than the following updates to our contractual obligations for future debt and interest payments over the next five years and thereafter as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Future Debt Obligations 
 As described further in Note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2024, scheduled maturities of our existing long-term debt for the remainder 2024 and for 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 are 1.3 million, 1.5 million, 407.4 million, 625.0 million and 0.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, scheduled maturities after 2028 aggregate to 400.0 million. 
 
 Future Interest Payments 
 We are obligated to make periodic interest payments at fixed and variable rates, depending on the terms of the applicable debt agreements. Based on applicable interest rates and scheduled debt maturities as of September 30, 2024, these interest obligations total approximately 55.4 million over the next twelve months. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table sets forth our changes in cash flows from September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 169,017 151,870 17,147 Net cash used in investing activities (67,352) (87,139) 19,787 Net cash used in financing activities (103,483) (88,324) (15,159) Effect of foreign currency rate changes on cash and equivalents 76 (315) 391 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (1,742) (23,908) 22,166 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased period over period primarily due to our new development in Nashville, TN that opened in October of 2023 and our acquired properties in Asheville, NC and Huntsville, AL that were acquired in November of 2023. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower additions to rental property as the 2023 period included additions related to our Nashville, TN center that opened in October 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased period over period primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid, higher amount of net share settlements related to the vesting of equity awards and finance origination costs related to the amendment and extension of our unsecured lines of credit, offset by proceeds from our common share offering under our ATM Offering program. 

Financing Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, unsecured borrowings represented 96 of our outstanding debt and 93 of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered. The Company guarantees the Operating Partnership s obligations under our unsecured lines of credit and our term loan. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we maintained unsecured lines of credit that provided for borrowings of up to 620.0 million. The unsecured lines of credit as of September 30, 2024 included a 20.0 million liquidity line and a 600.0 million syndicated line. The syndicated line may be increased up to 1.2 billion through an accordion feature in certain circumstances. 
 53 

In April 2024, the Operating Partnership entered into amendments to its unsecured lines of credit, which, among other things, increased the borrowing capacity from 520.0 million to 620.0 million, with an accordion feature to increase total borrowing capacity to 1.2 billion, extended the maturity date from July 14, 2025 to April 12, 2028 (which may be extended by one additional year by exercising extension options), and reduced the applicable pricing margin from Adjusted SOFR plus 100 basis points to Adjusted SOFR plus 85 basis points based on the Company's current credit rating. 
 
 We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unitholders. The Company and Operating Partnership are well-known seasoned issuers with a joint shelf registration statement on Form S-3, expiring in December 2026, that allows us to offer and sell unspecified amounts of different classes of securities. To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, property management opportunities, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria. Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or issue equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 
 
 We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short- and long-term. Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders, respectively, are typically made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually. Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing unsecured lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments. 
 
 We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the economic uncertainty caused by the current macroeconomic environment, including rising interest rates and inflation, and the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and when our next significant debt matures, which is our 350.0 million senior notes due September 2026. 
 
 Equity Offerings under the ATM Offering Program 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have a remaining authorization of 195.1 million of common shares under the ATM Offering program. 
 
 The following table sets forth information regarding issuances under our ATM Offering program: 
 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Number of common shares settled during the period 818,943 106,615 818,943 106,615 Average price per share 30.53 24.89 30.53 24.89 Aggregate gross proceeds (in thousands) 25,000 2,654 25,000 2,654 Aggregate net proceeds after commissions and fees (in thousands) 24,687 2,621 24,687 2,621 
 
 In October 2024, we issued an additional 484,741 common shares under our ATM Offering program, at an average price of 33.38 per share, yielding approximately 16.2 million of gross proceeds. 
 
 Our ATM Offering program also provides that we may sell common shares through forward sale contracts. Actual sales under the ATM Offering program will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions, the trading price of our common shares, our capital needs, and our determination of the appropriate sources of funding to meet such needs. 

54 

Derivatives 
 Throughout 2023, we entered into 325.0 million of forward-starting Daily SOFR interest rate swaps at average fixed pay rate of 3.90 . The swaps were effective February 1, 2024, and end at various dates from February 1, 2026 to January 1, 2027. These swaps replaced 300.0 million of existing swaps that expired on February 1, 2024, which had an average fixed pay rate of 0.4 , as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 
 The Operating Partnership s debt agreements require the maintenance of certain ratios, including debt service coverage and leverage, and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or 95 on a cumulative basis. 
 
 We have historically been, and at September 30, 2024 are, in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Our continued compliance with these covenants depends on many factors and could be impacted by current or future economic conditions. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default, which, if we were unable to cure or obtain a waiver from the lenders, could accelerate the repayment obligations. Further, in the event of default, the Company may be restricted from paying dividends to its shareholders in excess of dividends required to maintain its REIT qualification. Accordingly, an event of default could have a material and adverse impact on us. As a result, we have considered our short-term (one-year or less from the date of filing these financial statements) liquidity needs and the adequacy of our estimated cash flows from operating activities and other financing sources to meet these needs. These other sources include but are not limited to: existing cash, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions, our ability to sell debt or issue equity subject to market conditions and proceeds from the potential sale of non-core assets. We believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund our short-term liquidity needs. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants related to our debt obligations. 
 Senior unsecured notes financial covenants Required Actual Total Consolidated Debt to Adjusted Total Assets 150 257 Consolidated Income Available for Debt Service to Annual Debt Service Charge > 1.5 x 5.6 x 
 
 Lines of credit and term loan Required Actual Total Liabilities to Total Adjusted Asset Value 1.5 x 4.4 x Total Unsecured Indebtedness to Adjusted Unencumbered Asset Value 1.5 x 5.7 x

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP and the Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a discussion of our critical accounting estimates in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section. There have been no material changes to these estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES 
 
 Funds From Operations 
 
 Funds From Operations FFO is a widely used measure of the operating performance for real estate companies that supplements net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP. We determine FFO based on the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit ), of which we are a member. In December 2018, Nareit issued Nareit Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement, which clarifies, where necessary, existing guidance and consolidates alerts and policy bulletins into a single document for ease of use. Nareit defines FFO as net income (loss) available to the Company s common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. 
 
 FFO is intended to exclude historical cost depreciation of real estate as required by GAAP, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income (loss). 
 
 We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance. In addition, a portion of cash bonus compensation to certain members of management is based on our FFO or Core FFO, which is described in the section below. We believe it is useful for investors to have enhanced transparency into how we evaluate our performance and that of our management. In addition, FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is also widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates. We believe that FFO payout ratio, which represents regular distributions to common shareholders and unitholders of the Operating Partnership expressed as a percentage of FFO, is useful to investors because it facilitates the comparison of dividend coverage between REITs. Nareit has encouraged its member companies to report their FFO as a supplemental, industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance. 
 
 FFO has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 
 FFO does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 
 FFO does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 
 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and FFO does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 
 
 Other companies in our industry may calculate FFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 
 Because of these limitations, FFO should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our dividend paying capacity. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using FFO only as a supplemental measure. 

57 

Core FFO 
 
 We present Core Funds From Operations Core FFO as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define Core FFO as FFO further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. These further adjustments are itemized in the table below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Core FFO you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Core FFO should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 
 
 We present Core FFO because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we believe it is useful for investors to have enhanced transparency into how we evaluate management s performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies. We use Core FFO when certain material, unplanned transactions occur as a factor in evaluating management s performance and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and may use Core FFO when determining incentive compensation. 
 
 Core FFO has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are: 
 
 Core FFO does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 
 Core FFO does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 
 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Core FFO does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 
 
 Core FFO does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and 
 
 Other companies in our industry may calculate Core FFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 
 Because of these limitations, Core FFO should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Core FFO only as a supplemental measure.

Portfolio Net Operating Income and Same Center Net Operating Income 
 
 We present portfolio net operating income Portfolio NOI and same center net operating income Same Center NOI as supplemental measures of our operating performance. Portfolio NOI represents our property level net operating income which is defined as total operating revenues less property operating expenses and excludes termination fees and non-cash adjustments including straight-line rent, net above and below market rent amortization, impairment charges, loss on early extinguishment of debt and gains or losses on the sale of assets recognized during the periods presented. We define Same Center NOI as Portfolio NOI for the properties that were operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods and which were not acquired, or subject to a material expansion or non-recurring event, such as a natural disaster, during the comparable reporting periods. We present Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI on a consolidated basis. 
 
 We believe Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI are non-GAAP metrics used by industry analysts, investors and management to measure the operating performance of our properties because they provide performance measures directly related to the revenues and expenses involved in owning and operating real estate assets and provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income (loss), FFO or Core FFO. Because Same Center NOI excludes properties developed, redeveloped, acquired and sold; as well as non-cash adjustments, gains or losses on the sale of outparcels and termination rents; it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels, rental rates and operating costs on properties that were operational for both comparable periods. Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI, and accordingly, our Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. 
 
 Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or as an indicator of our financial performance since they do not reflect the entire operations of our portfolio, nor do they reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, other non-property income and losses, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, or trends in development and construction activities which are significant economic costs and activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Because of these limitations, Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI only as supplemental measures.

Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre 
 
 We present Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization EBITDA as adjusted for items described below Adjusted EBITDA ), EBITDA for Real Estate EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre, all non-GAAP measures, as supplemental measures of our operating performance. Each of these measures is defined as follows: 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) available to the Company s common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP before net interest expense, income taxes (if applicable), depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on sale of operating properties, joint venture properties, outparcels and other assets, impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investment in unconsolidated joint ventures caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, compensation related to voluntary retirement plan and other executive officer severance, certain executive departure-related adjustments, gain on sale of non-real estate asset, casualty gains and losses, gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt, net and other items that we do not consider indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance. 
 
 We determine EBITDAre based on the definition set forth by Nareit, which is defined as net income (loss) available to the Company s common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP before net interest expense, income taxes (if applicable), depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on sale of operating properties, gains and losses on change of control and impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investment in unconsolidated joint ventures caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and after adjustments to reflect our share of the EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDAre is defined as EBITDAre excluding gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt, net, casualty gains and losses, compensation related to voluntary retirement plan and other executive officer severance, gain on sale of non-real estate asset, gains and losses on sale of outparcels, and other items that that we do not consider indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance. 
 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as we believe they are useful for investors, creditors and rating agencies as they provide additional performance measures that are independent of a Company s existing capital structure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company s operating performance to other REITs and provide a more consistent metric for comparing the operating performance of the Company s real estate between periods. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre have significant limitations as analytical tools, including: 
 They do not reflect our net interest expense; 
 
 They do not reflect gains or losses on sales of operating properties or impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investment in unconsolidated joint ventures caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate; 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAre do not reflect gains and losses on extinguishment of debt and other items that may affect operations; and 
 
 Other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 
 Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre only as supplemental measures.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK 
 
 We are closely monitoring the impact of the overall macroeconomic environment on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact our tenants and business partners, along with continuing to monitor retail challenges such as supply chain and labor issues, inflationary pressures and rising interest rates. While we believe many of these retailers are proactively navigating this situation, the ultimate impact of interest rates, inflation, labor and supply chain issues and overall macroeconomic environment is unknown. 
 
 A portion of our rental revenues are derived from rents that directly depend on the sales volume of certain tenants. Accordingly, declines in these tenants sales would reduce the income produced by our properties. If the sales or profitability of our retail tenants decline sufficiently, whether due to a change in consumer preferences, health concerns, legislative changes that increase the cost of their operations or otherwise, such tenants may be unable to pay their existing rents as such rents would represent a higher percentage of their sales. 
 
 In addition, certain of our lease agreements include co-tenancy and/or sales-based provisions that may allow a tenant to pay reduced rent and/or terminate a lease prior to its natural expiration if we fail to maintain certain occupancy levels or retain specified named tenants, or if the tenant does not achieve certain specified sales targets. If our occupancy declines, certain centers may fall below the minimum co-tenancy thresholds and could trigger many tenants' contractual ability to pay reduced rents, which in turn may negatively impact our results of operations. 
 
 Due to the relatively short-term nature of our tenants leases, a significant portion of the leases in our portfolio come up for renewal each year. During 2024, approximately 2.6 million square feet, or 19 of the total portfolio, including our share of unconsolidated joint ventures, will come up for renewal. For the total portfolio, including the Company s pro rata share of unconsolidated joint ventures, as of September 30, 2024, we had lease renewals executed or in process for 72.5 of the space scheduled to expire during 2024 compared to 88.0 of the space scheduled to expire during 2023 that was executed or in process as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 The majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales (above predetermined levels) which generally increase as prices rise. A component of most leases includes a pro-rata share or escalating fixed contributions by the tenant for property operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and advertising and promotion, thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. 
 
 Our centers typically include well-known, national, brand name companies. By maintaining a broad base of well-known tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the United States, we believe we reduce our operating and leasing risks. As of September 30, 2024, no one tenant (including affiliates) accounted for more than 8 of our aggregate square feet or 6 of our aggregate rental revenues. 
 
 We believe retail real estate will continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for many brands and retailers. While we continue to attract and retain additional tenants, if we were unable to successfully renew or re-lease a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms or in a timely manner, the loss in rent and our Same Center NOI could be negatively impacted in future periods. Occupancy for our total portfolio, including our share of unconsolidated joint ventures, was 97.4 and 98 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates. 
 
 64 

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert existing floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of September 30, 2024 we have interest rate swap agreements in effect to fix the interest rates on outstanding debt with notional amounts totaling 325.0 million. Over the course of 2023, we entered into these interest rate swap agreements that became effective on February 1, 2024 to replace 300.0 million of expiring interest rate swaps, which had an average fixed pay rate of 0.40 , as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. The current derivatives have an average fixed pay rate of 3.90 and end at various dates from February 1, 2026 to January 1, 2027. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to our outstanding derivatives. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 4 of our outstanding consolidated debt, excluding the amount of variable rate debt with interest rate protection agreements in place, had variable interest rates and therefore was subject to market fluctuations. A change in the SOFR index of 100 basis points would result in an increase or decrease of approximately 517,000 in interest expense on an annual basis. 
 
 The interest rate spreads associated with our unsecured lines of credit and our unsecured term loan are based on our three investment grade credit ratings. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding balances under our unsecured lines of credit. An increase in our credit rating would provide a decrease in interest expense. If downgrades to our credit ratings occur, interest expense could increase depending upon the level of downgrade. 
 
 The information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value. As a result, the ultimate effect upon our operating results of interest rate fluctuations will depend on the interest rate exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time and future changes in the level of interest rates. 
 
 The estimated fair value and recorded value of our debt consisting of senior unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, secured mortgages and unsecured lines of credit were as follows (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Fair value of debt 1,363,199 1,319,700 Recorded value of debt 1,424,393 1,439,203 
 
 A 100 basis point increase from prevailing interest rates at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 would result in a decrease in fair value of total consolidated debt of approximately 35.2 million and 40.1 million, respectively. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our methodology in calculating the estimated fair value of debt. Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial instruments. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we could realize on the disposition of the financial instruments. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 We are also exposed to foreign currency risk on investments in centers that are located in Canada. Our currency exposure is concentrated in the Canadian Dollar. To mitigate some of the risk related to changes in foreign currency, cash flows received from our Canadian joint ventures are either reinvested to fund ongoing Canadian development activities, if applicable, or converted to US dollars and utilized to repay amounts outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit, if any. Accordingly, cash held in Canadian Dollars at any point in time is insignificant. We generally do not hedge currency translation exposures.
