Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements as to our future operating results; plans for the marketing of our services; future economic conditions; the effect of our market and product development efforts; and expectations or plans relating to the implementation or realization of our strategic goals and future growth, including through potential future acquisitions. Forward-looking statements may include, among other things, statements relating to future sales, earnings, cash flow, results of operations, use of cash and other measures of financial performance, as well as statements relating to future dividend payments.

These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industries in which we operate, and the beliefs and assumptions made by management.

Accordingly, the Company s actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Overview We were incorporated on January 25, 2022, in the state of Nevada, USA. We acquired 100 interest of JAAG Uniform Limited of Hong Kong JAAG Uniform on May 27, 2022, as our wholly owned subsidiary. JAAG Uniform, which was incorporated on November 4, 2021, in Hong Kong, is a start-up uniform supplier, specializing in the design, supply, and distribution of a wide range of uniform garments and accessories. It works with clothing manufacturers in Hong Kong and China on the fabrication of its products. Results of Operations Three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023: Revenues and Sale Expenses: We generated 9,979 in revenues, 4,222 in gross profit and incurred 5,757 in cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3,185 in revenues, 1,572 in gross profit and 1,613 in cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other Operating and General and Administrative Expenses: During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 13,295 in selling, general and administration expenses compared to 15,011 in selling, general and administration expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal, accounting, consulting and other professional services fees. Net Loss: Net loss was 9,250 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 13,436 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 12,491 compared to net cash used in operating activities of 8,678 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 18,782 consisting of advance from related party compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 11,750 consisting of advance from related party for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total Assets: The Company s total assets were 11,127 as of September 30, 2024 and 4,836 as of June 30, 2024. Total Liabilities: The Company s total liabilities were 43,366 as of September 30, 2024 compared to total liabilities of 27,825 as of June 30, 2024. Stockholders Deficit: The Company s shareholders deficit was 32,239 as of September 30, 2024 compared to a shareholder s deficit of 22,989 as of June 30, 2024. 13 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had 11,127 in current assets and total current liabilities of 43,366. We had a working capital deficiency of 32,239 as of September 30, 2024 compared to a working capital deficiency of 22,989 as of June 30, 2024. Capital Resources We anticipate we will need 50,000 for operations for the next 12 months, which includes 15,000 for selling, general and administrative purposes; 20,000 for professional fees, including legal and audit fees; 5,000 for consulting fees; and 10,000 for working capital. Based on the foregoing, our cash on hand will not be adequate to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements. Future Financings We anticipate we will need additional financing to fund our business operations in the future and will primarily rely on equity sales of our common stock and loans from related parties. We presently do not have any arrangements or commitments for additional financing in place. There is no assurance that we will achieve additional financing by either the sale of our equity securities or by debt financing. In addition, the issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial conditions, changes in financial conditions, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any contractual obligations and commitments. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK As a small reporting issuer , the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Our management, with the participation of our president (our principal executive officer, our principal accounting officer and our principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. 14 Table of Contents Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president (our principal executive officer, our principal accounting officer and our principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The reason or these deficiencies are as follows: 1) We have an inadequate number of personnel. 2) We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within our accounting functions. 3) We have insufficient written policies and procedure over our disclosures. Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our president (our principal executive officer and our principal accounting officer and principal financial officer), to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of our company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of our company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as of a specific date, and continued effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has conducted, with the participation of our president (our principal executive officer, our principal accounting officer and our principal financial officer), an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 in accordance with the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on present company activity. Our Company is in the process of adopting specific internal control mechanisms. Future controls, among other things, will include more checks and balances and communication strategies between the management and the board to ensure efficient and effective oversight over company activities as well as more stringent accounting policies to track and update our financial reporting. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting As of the end of the period covered by this report, there have been no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of management s last evaluation. 15 Table of Contents PART II.
