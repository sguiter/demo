 of face value, less a discount. Because control of the sold receivable is transferred to the buyer at the time of sale, accounts receivable balances sold are removed from the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets and the related proceeds are reported as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows. We had approximately and of trade receivables that were sold and removed from our balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We sometimes utilize third-party programs that allow our suppliers to be paid earlier at a discount or for a fee. While these programs assist us in negotiating payment terms with our suppliers, we continue to make payments based on our customary terms. A supplier can elect to take payment from a third party earlier with a discount, and in that case, we pay the third party on the original due date of the invoice. Contracts with our suppliers are negotiated independently of supplier participation in the programs, and we cannot increase payment terms pursuant to the programs. The accounts payable associated with the third-party programs, which remain on our Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets, were approximately at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The above items encompass multiple individual programs that are utilized as tools in our cash flow management, and we offer them as options to facilitate customer and vendor operating cycles. Because many of these programs operate independently, and a cessation of all these programs at the same time is not reasonably likely, we do not expect changes in these programs to have a material impact on our operating cash flows or liquidity.

 operating segments that supply a wide range of products: 
 Bedding Products: This segment supplies a variety of components and machinery used by bedding manufacturers in the production and assembly of their finished products, as well as produces private label finished mattresses and adjustable bed bases. This segment is also vertically integrated into the production and supply of specialty foam chemicals, steel rod, and drawn steel wire to our own operations and to external customers. We also supply steel rod and wire to trade customers that operate in a broad range of markets. 
 Specialized Products: From this segment, we supply lumbar support systems, seat suspension systems, motors and actuators, and control cables used by automotive manufacturers. We also produce and distribute tubing and tube assemblies for the aerospace industry and engineered hydraulic cylinders used in the material-handling and heavy construction industries. 
 Furniture, Flooring Textile Products: Operations in this segment supply a wide range of components for residential and work furniture manufacturers, as well as select lines of private label finished furniture. We also produce or distribute carpet cushion, hard surface flooring underlayment, and textile and geo components. 
 Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure. Our Bedding Products and Furniture, Flooring Textile Products segments have an executive vice president who has accountability to, and maintains regular contact with, our CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM). With the retirement of our Specialized Products segment executive vice president in April 2024, our CEO became acting segment manager on a temporary basis for this segment until a permanent replacement is named. The operating results and financial information reported through the segment structure are regularly reviewed and used by the CODM to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources, and determine management incentive compensation. 
 The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate performance based on Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT). Intersegment sales are made primarily at prices that approximate market-based selling prices. Centrally incurred costs are allocated to the segments based on estimates of services used by the segment. Certain of our general and administrative costs and miscellaneous corporate income and expenses are allocated to the segments based on sales or other appropriate metrics. These allocated corporate costs include depreciation and other costs and income related to assets that are not allocated or otherwise included in the segment assets.

 In general, the fair values for our reporting units decreased versus prior year due to macroeconomic pressures, including low demand, particularly in residential end markets. The fair values of our reporting units were reconciled to our consolidated market capitalization, which decreased due to the significant decline in stock price during the second quarter of 2024. Our closing stock price per share was on December 29, 2023, on March 28, 2024, and on June 28, 2024. The impairment was concluded in connection with the preparation of the second quarter financial statements. If actual results differ materially from estimates used in our calculations, we could incur future impairment charges.

HIGHLIGHTS 
 We had trade sales of 1,102 million for the three months ending September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6 versus the third quarter 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, trade sales were 3,327 million versus 3,610 million for the same period of 2023. 
 Earnings (Loss) Per Share (EPS) was .33 for the third quarter and 3.83) for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, compared to .39 and 1.18 in the same periods of 2023. Third quarter EPS includes .07 in restructuring and restructuring-related charges and a .08 gain from the sale of real estate related to the Restructuring Plan. Year-to-date EPS includes a 4.61 non-cash goodwill impairment charge, .19 in restructuring and restructuring-related charges, .03 from compensation costs related to the CEO transition, .07 from gains from sales of idle real estate, .08 from gains from the sale of real estate related to the Restructuring Plan, and .01 from a gain on net insurance proceeds from 2023 tornado damage. Third quarter and year-to-date 2023 EPS included a .03 gain from a real estate sale within our Bedding segment. Year-to-date 2023 EPS also included a .02 gain from net insurance proceeds from the tornado damage. 
 Earnings (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) for the third quarter and nine months ending September 30, 2024 was 78 million and 474) million, respectively. Third quarter includes 12 million of restructuring and restructuring-related costs and a 14 million gain from the sale of real estate related to the Restructuring Plan. Year-to-date EBIT includes a 675 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, 34 million of restructuring and restructuring-related costs, a 14 million gain from the sale of real estate related to the Restructuring Plan, 13 million in gains from the sales of idle real estate, 4 million in CEO transition compensation costs, and a 2 million gain from net insurance proceeds from 2023 tornado damage. This is down 14 million and 750 million compared to the same periods in 2023. Third quarter and year-to-date 2023 EBIT included a 5 million gain from the sale of real estate. Year-to-date 2023 EBIT also reflected a 4 million gain from net insurance proceeds from the tornado damage. 
 The Restructuring Plan is progressing as planned across all three of our segments and our general and administrative cost initiatives. 
 Operating cash flow was 183 million in the first nine months of 2024, a decrease of 168 million versus the same period of 2023. 
 In August 2024, the Board of Directors declared a third quarter 2024 dividend of .05, .41 lower than last year's third quarter dividend. 
 We continue to make progress on the deleveraging of our balance sheet. We paid down 124 million of debt in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
 What We Do 
 We are a diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs, and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, and automobiles. We make components that are often hidden within, but integral to, our customers products. 
 23 

We are a leading supplier of bedding components and private label finished goods; automotive seat comfort and convenience systems; home and work furniture components; geo components; flooring underlayment; hydraulic cylinders for material handling and heavy construction industries; and aerospace tubing and fabricated assemblies. 
 
 Our Segments 
 Our operations are comprised of approximately 120 production facilities located in 18 countries around the world. Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure. Our segments are described below. 
 Bedding Products: This segment supplies a variety of components and machinery used by bedding manufacturers in the production and assembly of their finished products, as well as produces private label finished mattresses and adjustable bed bases. This segment is also vertically integrated into the production and supply of specialty foam chemicals, steel rod, and drawn steel wire to our own operations and to external customers. We also supply steel rod and wire to trade customers that operate in a broad range of markets. This segment contributed 40 of our trade sales during the first nine months of 2024. 
 Specialized Products: From this segment, we supply lumbar support systems, seat suspension systems, motors and actuators, and control cables used by automotive manufacturers. We also produce and distribute tubing and tube assemblies for the aerospace industry and engineered hydraulic cylinders used in the material-handling and heavy construction industries. This segment contributed 28 of our trade sales in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Furniture, Flooring Textile Products: Operations in this segment supply a wide range of components for residential and work furniture manufacturers, as well as select lines of private label finished furniture. We also produce or distribute carpet cushion, hard surface flooring underlayment, and textile and geo components. This segment contributed 32 of our trade sales in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Customers 
 We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing less than 6 of our trade sales in 2023. Many are companies whose names are widely recognized. They include bedding brands and manufacturers, residential and office furniture producers, automotive OEM and Tier 1 manufacturers, and a variety of other companies. 
 
 Organic Sales 
 We calculate organic sales as trade sales excluding sales attributable to acquisitions and divestitures consummated within the last twelve months. Management uses the metric, and it is useful to investors, as supplemental information to analyze our underlying sales performance from period to period in our legacy businesses. 
 
 Major Factors That Impact Our Business 
 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (the business groups that are one level below the operating segments) when triggering events occur, or at least annually. We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the second quarter. The 2023 goodwill impairment testing indicated no impairments. 
 The 2024 annual goodwill impairment testing indicated that fair value had fallen below carrying value for three reporting units, and fair value exceeded carrying value by less than 100 for one reporting unit. 
 24 

A 675 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge was recorded related to the following reporting units: 
 Reporting Unit Segment Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Bedding Bedding Products 587.2 Work Furniture Furniture, Flooring Textile Products 44.5 Hydraulic Cylinders Specialized Products 43.6 675.3 
 The fair values of our reporting units in relation to their respective carrying values and significant assumptions used are presented in the tables in Note F to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, beginning on page 15. 
 In general, the fair values for our reporting units decreased versus prior year due to macroeconomic pressures, including low demand, particularly in residential end markets. The fair values of our reporting units were reconciled to our consolidated market capitalization, which decreased due to the significant decline in stock price during the second quarter of 2024. Our closing stock price per share was 26.17 on December 29, 2023, 19.15 on March 28, 2024, and 11.46 on June 28, 2024. We concluded that an impairment existed under generally accepted accounting principles in connection with the preparation and review of our second quarter financial statements filed on August 7, 2024 as part of the quarterly report on Form 10-Q . We do not expect that the impairment charge will result in any cash expenditures. If actual results differ materially from estimates used in our calculations, we could incur future impairment charges. 
 Units with Impairments 
 In addition to the decline in our stock price during the second quarter, the reporting units discussed below also had the following factors contributing to the impairments: 
 Bedding 
 Domestic bedding manufacturers are facing numerous challenges, including low demand, overcapacity, and increased pressure from finished mattress imports, resulting in financial stress across the industry. The domestic mattress market has changed dramatically in a relatively short time span. The landscape has shifted from a largely domestic OEM-produced innerspring mattress market to one where innerspring, foam, and hybrid mattresses are sold at a wide range of price points through a variety of channels and produced by a mix of fewer large domestic OEMs, domestic private label producers, and import manufacturers. These changing market dynamics and weak demand have created disruption and financial instability with some of our customers. 
 The Bedding reporting unit's fair value exceeded carrying value by 40 at our second quarter 2023 testing date. Late in the fourth quarter of 2023 we concluded we had a triggering event after certain of our Elite Comfort Solutions and Kayfoam customers notified us of efforts to improve their financial position by moving their business to or exploring alternative suppliers. We expected that these customer efforts would reduce our future cash flows. Accordingly, we performed a goodwill impairment test, which indicated no goodwill impairments. However, the estimated fair value of this reporting unit had decreased and fair value in excess of carrying value had dropped to 19 . 
 Work Furniture 
 Work Furniture demand for both contract and residential end-use products has remained at sustained low levels. Fair value exceeded carrying value by 74 at our second quarter 2023 testing date. 
 Hydraulic Cylinders 
 The Hydraulic Cylinders reporting unit's fair value at our second quarter 2023 testing date exceeded carrying value by 18 . Fair value approximated carrying value primarily due to an August 2022 acquisition that is experiencing operational inefficiencies. 
 Units with No Impairments, but Fair Value Exceeded Carrying Value by Less than 100 
 Aerospace Products 
 The Aerospace Products reporting unit did not incur impairment charges, but fair value exceeded carrying value by less than 100 at both testing dates. The fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 
 25 

21 at our second quarter 2024 testing date as compared to 44 in 2023. Aerospace s long-term forecasts continue to reflect demand improvements as industry recovery continues. Current demand is now similar to pre-pandemic levels. 
 
 Restructuring Plan 
 In the first quarter of 2024, we committed to a restructuring plan, primarily associated with our Bedding Products segment and, to a lesser extent, our Furniture, Flooring Textile Products segment (the Restructuring Plan or Plan ), which is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2025. The Plan was expanded in the second quarter of 2024 to include a restructuring opportunity within the Specialized Products segment and in the third quarter of 2024 to include the general and administrative cost structure initiatives. Pursuant to the Plan, we expect to: 
 consolidate between 15 and 20 production and distribution facilities (out of 50) in the Bedding Products segment and a small number of production facilities in the Furniture, Flooring Textile Products segment; 
 incur restructuring and restructuring-related costs between 65 and 85 million, of which 40 to 50 million are anticipated to be incurred in 2024 and the remainder in 2025. This includes 30 to 40 million in cash costs, the majority of which are anticipated to be incurred in 2024; 
 realize annualized EBIT benefit of 50 to 60 million after initiatives are fully implemented in late 2025 versus our prior estimate of 40 to 50 million, as we now expect to realize approximately a 10 million benefit in 2025 from general and administrative initiatives; 
 receive between 60 and 80 million in pretax net cash proceeds from the sale of real estate associated with the Restructuring Plan; and 
 experience a reduction in annual sales by approximately 80 million. 
 We continue to make solid progress executing the Plan. To date, we have consolidated 13 production and distribution facilities in the Bedding Products segment and two production facilities in the Furniture, Flooring Textile Products segment. All domestic innerspring production has been shifted into our four larger, remaining spring production facilities. We also downsized our Chinese innerspring operation and will exit our Mexican innerspring operation by year end, which will conclude all innerspring-related restructuring activity in Bedding Products. In Specialty Foam, we have closed three operations. In early fourth quarter we closed one Adjustable Bed location and shifted production to a more cost-advantaged facility. We successfully executed the restructuring activity in Home Furniture, and we expect to complete phase one of our Flooring Products restructuring by early next year. In Hydraulic Cylinders, manufacturing optimization and operational efficiency improvements are underway. 
 We initiated a thorough analysis of our general and administrative cost structure across our business units and corporate shared services. Our general and administrative project team is analyzing and identifying opportunities to drive efficiencies. We continue to analyze and identify potential opportunities within our business unit functions; however, we anticipate potential cost reductions will be smaller than those identified in our corporate functions. 
 We are also exploring a potential sale of our Aerospace business, which is not included in the Plan, and have incurred 1 million of restructuring-related costs in the third quarter of 2024 related to this activity. This business has not reached the criteria to be classified as held for sale. 
 Total restructuring and restructuring-related costs, including Plan costs and costs to explore the potential sale of our Aerospace business, for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024, were 12 million 11 million cash and 1 million non-cash) and 34 million 27 million cash and 7 million Tonon-cash), respectively. 
 We realized 6 million of EBIT benefit from the Plan in the third quarter and 9 million year to date. We still expect to realize approximately 10- 15 million of EBIT benefit in 2024. In the third quarter we realized 4 million of sales attrition and have realized 7 million of sales attrition year to date. We now expect sales attrition in 2024 of approximately 15 million versus our prior estimate of 25 million. 
 To date and in line with 2024 expectations, we have realized 20 million of proceeds from the sale of real estate associated with the Plan, including the sale of one facility in third quarter 2024 for net proceeds of 17 
 26 

million (pretax gain of 14 million) and one facility in late October 2024 for net proceeds of 3 million (estimated pretax gain of 3 million). 
 Because of certain risks and uncertainties, the Plan may not achieve its intended outcomes. Our estimates of the number of facilities to be consolidated and the cash and non-cash costs and impairments associated with the Plan may change as our analysis develops and additional information is obtained. Also, we may not be able to implement the Plan in a timely manner that will positively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we may not be able to dispose of real estate pursuant to the Plan or obtain the expected proceeds in a timely manner. The Plan may also negatively impact our relationships with employees, customers, and vendors. Finally, because restructuring activities are complex and involve time-consuming processes, substantial demands may be placed on management, which could divert attention from other business priorities or disrupt our daily operations. Any failure to achieve the intended outcomes could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and liquidity. 
 
 We continue to evaluate our businesses for further restructuring opportunities in addition to those activities included in the announced Plan. The execution of any of these opportunities may result in additional material restructuring costs, restructuring-related costs, or impairments. 
 
 Market Demand 
 Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with housing turnover and consumer confidence being the most significant. Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, and interest rates. All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our products and components. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately 25 -30 of our sales. The dynamic macroeconomic environment has pressured most of our end markets and negatively affected the demand for our products. As a result, we expect 2024 overall demand to be down from 2023 levels. 
 Additionally, the growth of new Chinese auto market entrants and increases in Chinese auto exports, particularly to Europe, is driving further market disruption. Europe has responded by introducing new tariffs, but it is to be seen if this will slow the pace of Chinese imports. These Chinese imports have, and may continue to have, a negative impact to the demand for our automotive products. A Chinese OEM could displace one or more of our existing customers and elect an alternative domestic supplier, which could result in additional lost market share. In Europe, economic softness and consumer affordability issues have given Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers opportunities to supply lower price electric vehicles, leading to the production declines and program launch delays for our customers. In North America, consumer affordability issues and uncertainty around EV transition timelines is resulting in program launch delays and our customers replacing higher cost components with lower cost components. 
 
 Trends in Cost of Goods Sold 
 Our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate. We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market. We have also been impacted by fluctuations in transportation, energy, and labor costs. Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial. When we experience significant increases in costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers. The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs, and we also realize a lag as costs decline. 
 Steel is our principal raw material. At various times in past years, we have experienced significant cost fluctuations in this commodity. In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments. Steel costs fluctuated up and down throughout 2023, but overall average costs deflated as U.S. steel markets faced softened demand and increased foreign competition. Steel costs decreased in the second and third quarters of 2024 following a relatively stable first quarter. 
 As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by changes in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). Metal margins compressed through 2023 and, as a result, we experienced lower metal margins in our Steel Rod business. Metal margins were stable in the first quarter of 2024 and modestly declined in the second and third quarters. 
 27 

We have exposure to the cost of chemicals, including TDI, MDI, and polyol. The cost of these chemicals has fluctuated at times, but we have generally passed the changes through to our customers. Pricing softened through 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, modestly increased in the second quarter of 2024, and moderated again in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Our other raw materials include woven and nonwoven fabrics. We have experienced changes in the costs of these materials and generally have been able to pass them through to our customers. 
 When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components. We must continue providing product options to our customers that enable them to improve the functionality of their products and manage their costs, while providing higher profits for our operations. 
 
 Supply Chain Shortages and Disruptions 
 We have experienced supply chain disruptions related to freight challenges, including higher costs. 
 In 2023, drought conditions lowered the water levels of the Mississippi River and Panama Canal, reducing traffic through these waterways. Also, in late 2023 and early 2024, the conflict in the Red Sea caused delays with some of our shipments, while other shipments from China to the U.S. or Europe have been re-routed. Although these issues have not had a material impact on our results of operations, additional logistical disruptions including, but not limited to, labor availability, potential strikes, port congestion, trade tensions, and natural disasters, could result in additional costs and delays in our ability to deliver products timely to certain customers. 
 
 Competition 
 Many of our markets are highly competitive, with the number of competitors varying by product line. In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies. Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price. Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering innovation, better product quality, and customer service. 
 We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors, as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically compete in market segments that value product differentiation. When we do compete on cost, we typically remain price competitive in most of our business units, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, automation, vertical integration in steel rod and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large-scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. To stay competitive with global steel costs, both contract and non-contract innerspring pricing were adjusted in the back half of 2023 and are expected to be fully realized in 2024. We have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs and shifting production offshore to take advantage of lower input costs. 
 We produce innersprings for mattresses that are sold to bedding manufacturers. We produce steel wire rod for consumption by our wire mills (primarily used by our innerspring manufacturing facilities to produce innersprings) and to sell to third parties. We also produce and sell finished mattresses. In response to petitions filed with the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) generally alleging that innersprings, steel wire rod, and mattresses were being unfairly sold in the United States by certain foreign manufacturers at less than fair value (dumping) and that certain foreign manufacturers of steel wire rod and mattresses were unfairly benefiting from subsidies, antidumping and/or countervailing duties have been imposed on the imports of such products. 
 In March 2020, the Company, along with other petitioners, filed petitions with the DOC and the ITC alleging that manufacturers of mattresses in seven different countries were unfairly selling their products in the United States at less than fair value and manufacturers of mattresses in China were benefiting from subsidies. These petitions resulted in antidumping and countervailing duty orders set to remain in effect for five years, through May 2026, at which time the DOC and ITC will conduct a sunset review to determine whether to extend the orders for an additional five years. Following certain appeals that were filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), some of which remain ongoing, the CIT ruled in favor of the ITC and petitioners and sustained the 
 28 

ITC s unanimous injury decision. In February 2024, one respondent filed an appeal of the CIT's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but that respondent agreed to dismiss the appeal on October 29, 2024. 
 In July 2023, the Company, along with other petitioners, filed petitions with the DOC and the ITC alleging that manufacturers of mattresses in twelve additional countries were unfairly selling their products in the United States at less than fair value and manufacturers of mattresses in Indonesia were unfairly benefiting from subsidies, causing harm to the U.S. industry and seeking the imposition of duties on mattresses imported from these countries. The ITC made a preliminary determination of injury in September 2023, and the DOC s preliminary determination on dumping was issued in February 2024. With respect to eight of the countries, the DOC s final dumping determinations were issued in May 2024, and the ITC's final injury determination was issued in June 2024. With respect to the five remaining countries, the DOC s final determinations were issued in July 2024, and the order evidencing the ITC s final determination with respect to the four countries which were above the de minimis threshold was issued in September 2024. 
 See Item 1 Legal Proceedings on page 45 for more information. 
 If any of the foregoing existing or future antidumping and countervailing duties are overturned on appeal or not extended beyond their current terms and dumping and/or subsidization recurs, or manufacturers in the subject countries circumvent the existing duties through transshipment in other jurisdictions or otherwise, our market share, sales, profit margins, and earnings could be adversely affected. 
 
 Reduced 2024 Amortization 
 We expect our full-year 2024 amortization expense to be approximately 45 million lower as compared to 2023 as a result of the fourth quarter 2023 long-lived asset impairments in the Bedding Products segment. 
 
 Strategic Initiatives 
 We are currently conducting a strategic review of our diverse portfolio, assessing how each business fits into our long-term vision. We are focused on simplifying our portfolio to businesses that are the right long-term fit for Leggett Platt. As part of this strategic review, we are currently exploring the potential sale of our Aerospace business. This business has not reached the criteria to be classified as held for sale.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Discussion of Consolidated Results 
 
 Third Quarter: 
 Trade sales were 1,102 million in the current quarter, a 6 decrease versus the third quarter 2023. Organic sales decreased 6 . Volume was down 4 , primarily from continued weak demand in residential end markets, the expected loss of a customer in Specialty Foam, and demand headwinds in Automotive and Hydraulic Cylinders. Raw material-related selling price decreases, net of currency benefit, reduced sales 2 . 
 EBIT decreased 15 , to 78 million, primarily from unfavorable sales mix in Steel Rod and Specialty Foam, lower volume, restructuring costs, metal margin compression, and higher bad debt reserves. These decreases were partially offset by a gain on restructuring-related real estate, lower amortization, operational efficiency improvements, and restructuring benefit. 
 EPS decreased to .33 in the current quarter, versus .39 in the third quarter of 2023. The decline primarily reflects lower EBIT as discussed above. 
 
 Nine Months: 
 Trade sales were 3,327 million in the first nine months of 2024, an 8 decrease versus the same period last year. Organic sales decreased 8 . Volume was down 5 , primarily from continued weak demand in residential end markets and the expected loss of a customer in Specialty Foam. Raw material-related selling price decreases and currency impact reduced sales 3 . 
 EBIT decreased 271 to 474) million, primarily from a 675 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, in addition to restructuring costs, lower volume, unfavorable sales mix in Steel Rod and Specialty Foam, metal margin compression, and higher bad debt reserves. These decreases were partially offset by lower amortization, operational efficiency improvements, gains on sales of real estate, and restructuring benefit. 
 EPS decreased to 3.83) for the first nine months of 2024, versus 1.18 in the same period of 2023. The decline primarily reflects lower EBIT as discussed above. 
 
 Net Interest Expense and Income Taxes 
 
 Net interest expense w as flat and 3 million lower in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to same periods last year. Interest rates were higher on slightly higher interest-bearing cash balances. Interest rates on borrowings were also higher, but average outstanding balances were lower. 
 
 Our worldwide effective tax rate was 22 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 25 for the same quarter last year. While the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate was 21 in both years, foreign withholding taxes and the impact of foreign earnings added 3 to our tax rate in 2024 and 2 in 2023, while changes in estimates related to tax filings reduced our tax rate by 1 in 2024 while increasing it 2 in 2023. Other less significant items reduced the tax rate by an additional 1 in 2024. 
 We are anticipating a tax rate of 23 for the fourth quarter of 2024, including the impact of discrete tax items that we expect to occur. We utilize prudent tax planning strategies for opportunities to optimize our tax rate, but other factors, such as our overall profitability, the mix and level of earnings among jurisdictions, the type of income earned, business acquisitions and dispositions, the impact of tax audits, and the effect of tax law changes can also influence our rate.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITALIZATION 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Sources of Cash 
 
 Cash on Hand 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 277 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Substantially all of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations. 
 If we were to immediately bring back all our foreign cash to the U.S. in the form of dividends, we would pay foreign withholding taxes of approximately 17 million. Due to capital requirements in various jurisdictions, approximately 34 million of this cash was inaccessible for repatriation at September 30, 2024. Inaccessible cash balances can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the amount of foreign distributable profits available and the variability of our foreign cash balances. 
 
 Cash from Operations 
 The primary source of funds for our short-term cash requirements is our cash generated from operating activities. Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations. Cash from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 183 million, down 168 million from the same period last year, primarily from lower earnings and less working capital improvements versus last year. 
 33 

We closely monitor our working capital levels and ended the quarter with adjusted working capital at 14.5 of annualized trade sales. The table below explains this non-GAAP calculation. We eliminate cash, current debt maturities, and the current portion of operating lease liabilities from working capital to monitor our operating efficiency and performance related to trade receivables, inventories, and accounts payable. We believe this provides a more useful measurement to investors since cash and current maturities can fluctuate significantly from period to period. As discussed in Cash on Hand above, substantially all of these funds are held by international operations and may not be immediately available to reduce debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis. (Dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Current assets 1,734.5 1,881.4 Current liabilities 1

 4,406.8 4,460.4 Working capital as a percent of annualized trade sales 12.8 13.9 Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized trade sales 14.5 13.9 
 1 Current liabilities include dividends payable, which were 6.7 million and 61.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 2 Annualized trade sales is the respective quarter's trade sales multiplied by 4 (third quarter 2024 and fourth quarter 2023 trade sales were 1,101.7 million and 1,115.1 million, respectively). We believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful, since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume.

We continue to monitor all elements of working capital in order to optimize cash flow. 
 
 Trade Receivables - Our trade receivables and DSO increased at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 primarily due to sales late in the quarter, timing of collections, and volume increases in our Steel Rod business, partially offset by lower pricing due to deflation. Trade receivables decreased and DSO remained flat compared to September 30, 2023 from demand softness, lower pricing due to deflation, and restructuring plan impacts. These were partially offset by volume increases in our Steel Rod and Aerospace businesses. 
 We recorded bad debt expense of 9 million during the first nine months of 2024. Weak demand and changing market dynamics have created disruption and financial instability for some of our customers, particularly in the Bedding Products segment. A few of these customers began to exhibit slow payment and past-due trends during 2024. As a result, we increased our reserves for these customers and implemented payment plans where needed. We believe we have established appropriate reserves. 
 We monitor our receivable portfolio closely and make reserve decisions based upon individual customer credit risk reviews, customer payment trends (percentage of current and past due), historical loss experience, and general macroeconomic and industry trends that could impact the expected collectability of all customers or pools of customers with similar risk. We obtain credit applications, credit reports, bank and trade references, and periodic financial statements from our customers to establish credit limits and terms as appropriate. In cases where a customer s payment performance or financial condition begins to deteriorate or in the event of a customer bankruptcy, we tighten our credit limits and terms and make appropriate reserves based upon the facts and circumstances for each individual customer, as well as pools of similar customers. 
 Inventories - Our inventories and DIO decreased at September 30, 2024 compared to both December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 due to demand softness, efforts to reduce inventories, deflation, and Restructuring Plan impacts. 
 We continuously monitor our slower-moving and potentially obsolete inventory through reports on inventory quantities compared to usage within the previous 12 months. We also utilize cycle counting programs and complete physical counts of our inventory. When potential inventory obsolescence is indicated by these controls, we will take charges for write-downs to maintain an adequate level of reserves. Inventory write-downs for the first nine months of 2024 were 25 million versus 5 million in 2023, primarily due to write-downs on selected products and Restructuring Plan impacts primarily within the Bedding Products segment. 
 Accounts Payable - Our accounts payable decreased and DPO increased compared to December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 primarily due to demand softness and timing of payments. Our payment terms did not change meaningfully since last year, and we have continued to focus on optimizing payment terms with our vendors. We continue to look for ways to establish and maintain favorable payment terms through purchasing synergies and also utilize third-party services that offer flexibility to our vendors, which, in turn, helps us manage our DPO as discussed below. 
 Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable Programs - We participate in trade receivables sales programs in combination with certain customers and third-party banking institutions. Under each of these programs, we sell our entire interest in the trade receivable for 100 of face value, less a discount. Because control of the sold receivable is transferred to the buyer at the time of sale, accounts receivable balances sold are removed from the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets and the related proceeds are reported as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows. We had approximately 45 and 60 million of trade receivables that were sold and removed from our balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These sales reduced our quarterly DSO by roughly four and five days at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Activities in these programs decreased year-to-date operating cash flow by approximately 15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For accounts payable, we have historically looked for ways to optimize payment terms through utilizing third-party programs that allow our suppliers to be paid earlier at a discount or for a fee. While these programs assist us in negotiating payment terms with our suppliers, we continue to make payments based on our customary terms. Contracts with our suppliers are negotiated independently of supplier 
 35 

participation in the programs, and we cannot increase payment terms pursuant to the programs. The primary program allows a supplier to elect to take payment from a third party earlier with a discount, and in that case, we pay the third party on the original due date of the invoice. As such, there is no direct impact on our DPO, accounts payable, operating cash flows, or liquidity. The accounts payable settled through the third-party programs, which remain on our Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets, were approximately 100 million at September 30, 2024 and 105 million at December 31, 2023. 
 The above items encompass multiple individual programs that are utilized as tools in our cash flow management, and we offer them as options to facilitate customer and vendor operating cycles. Because many of these programs operate independently, and a cessation of all these programs at the same time is not reasonably likely, we do not expect changes in these programs to have a material impact on our operating cash flows or liquidity. 
 Mexico Value-Added Taxes (VAT) Recoverable - We are subject to VAT in various jurisdictions. Where we are entitled to a refund of the VAT we have paid, we are required to make a claim for refund from the government authorities. We establish VAT receivables for these claims, but have been experiencing refund delays in Mexico. We believe these are fully collectible. The aggregate of current and long-term balances of Mexico VAT recoverable was 36 million and 48 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our recent discussions with the government have resulted in an updated timeline for resolution. As a result, we have classified 6 million as long-term as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Commercial Paper Program 
 Another source of funds for our short-term cash requirements is our 1.2 billion commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2024, we had 84 million commercial paper outstanding. For more information regarding the borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program, see Commercial Paper Program on page 38. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 Our credit facility is a multi-currency facility providing us the ability, from time to time, to borrow, repay, and re-borrow up to 1.2 billion until the maturity date, at which time our ability to borrow under the facility will terminate. The credit facility matures in September 2026. Currently, there are no borrowings under the credit facility. For more information on our credit facility, see Credit Facility on page 39. 
 
 Capital Markets 
 We also believe that we have the ability to raise debt in the capital markets which acts as a source of funding of long-term cash requirements. Currently, we have 1.9 billion of total debt outstanding. The maturities of the long-term debt range from 2024 through 2051. Our next scheduled maturity of outstanding debt is our 300 million 3.8 Senior Notes due in November 2024, which we expect to retire predominantly with commercial paper. For more information, please see Long-Term Debt (including Current Maturities) on page 39. 
 
 Uses of Cash 
 The Board and our management team thoroughly evaluated our capital allocation priorities and, after much consideration, determined to reduce our quarterly dividend. We expect to reallocate a large portion of cash spent on dividends to deleverage our balance sheet and enhance our financial position in the near term as weak demand, primarily in our residential end markets, continues to pressure earnings. In the longer term, we expect to use cash to grow our business both organically and through strategic acquisitions, while also returning cash to shareholders via a combination of dividends and share buybacks. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We are making investments to support expansion in businesses and product lines where sales are profitably growing, for efficiency improvement and maintenance, and for system enhancements. We expect capital expenditures of 100 million in 2024 of which we have spent 60 million as of September 30, 2024. For the periods covered, our employee incentive plans emphasized returns on capital, including capital expenditures and working capital. This emphasis focuses our management on asset utilization and helps ensure that we are investing additional capital dollars where attractive return potential exists. 
 36 

Acquisitions 
 We seek strategic acquisitions that complement our current products and capabilities. 
 We did not acquire any businesses in the first nine months of 2024. For the full year 2024, we currently expect acquisition activity to be minimal. 
 
 Dividends 
 In August 2024, we declared a quarterly dividend of .05 per share, a .41 or 89 decrease versus third quarter of 2023. The decision to reduce the dividend was made following a thorough evaluation by the Board and our management team. This action will free up capital to accelerate the deleveraging of our balance sheet and solidify our long-held financial strength. 
 
 Stock Repurchases 
 During the third quarter of 2024, there were no material share repurchases and we issued .1 million shares through employee benefit plans. For the first nine months of 2024, the Company repurchased .2 million shares of our stock (at an average price of 20.85) and issued 1.1 million shares through employee benefit plans. 
 We have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each calendar year, but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable. The amount of future repurchases is dependent upon price of the stock, the amount of discretionary cash flow generated by the Company, alternative uses for the cash (including debt reduction, organic growth opportunities, and acquisitions) and other factors. We expect stock repurchases to be minimal for the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Short-Term and Long-Term Cash Requirements 
 In addition to the expected uses of cash discussed above, we have various material short-term (12 months or less) and long-term (more than 12 months) cash requirements. There have been no material changes in the third quarter 2024 to our short-term or long-term cash requirements as previously reported in our cash requirements table on page 52 of our Form 10-K filed February 27, 2024. We expect to have adequate liquidity to meet our short-term and long-term cash requirements.

 The unused committed credit amount is based on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program which, at year end 2023 and at the end of the third quarter of 2024, had a total authorized program amount of 1.2 billion. However, our borrowing capacity is limited by covenants to our credit facility. Reference is made to the discussion under Commercial Paper Program below and Credit Facility on page 39 for more details about our borrowing capacity at September 30, 2024.

 1 
 Our borrowing capacity is limited by covenants to our credit facility. Reference is made to the discussion under Credit Facility on page 39 for more details about our borrowing capacity at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The average and maximum amounts of commercial paper outstanding during the third quarter of 2024 were 229 million and 266 million, respectively. We expect to increase our outstanding balance in the fourth 
 38 

quarter 2024 by predominately utilizing commercial paper to retire our 300 million 3.8 Senior Notes which mature on November 15, 2024. At quarter end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility, but we had issued 52 million of stand-by letters of credit under other bank agreements to take advantage of better pricing. 
 Over the long-term, and subject to our credit ratings, market conditions, capital needs, and alternative capital market opportunities, we expect to maintain the indebtedness under the commercial paper program by continuously repaying and reissuing the commercial paper notes. We view the notes as a source of long-term funds and have classified the borrowings under the commercial paper program as long-term borrowings on our balance sheet. We have the intent to roll over such obligations on a long-term basis and have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis as evidenced by our 1.2 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2026 discussed below. Recently, our credit ratings have lowered and could be lowered further. Lower credit ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and our financial arrangements, including access to the commercial paper market, our lending agreements, and supply chain financing arrangements. If we are unable to meet our short-term borrowing needs in the commercial paper market, we may rely more heavily on bank debt to fund short-term working capital needs at higher interest costs. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 Our multi-currency credit facility matures in September 2026. It provides us the ability, from time to time, subject to certain restrictive covenants and customary conditions, to borrow, repay, and re-borrow up to 1.2 billion. 
 To provide additional borrowing capacity and financial flexibility, we amended our credit agreement in March 2024 to increase the Leverage Ratio from 3.50 to 1.00 to 4.00 to 1.00. After the amendment, our credit facility contains restrictive covenants which include (a) an amended Leverage Ratio requiring us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, or when we borrow under the credit facility (i) Consolidated Funded Indebtedness minus the lesser of: (A) Unrestricted Cash, or (B) 750 million to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA for the four consecutive trailing quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2024 through June 30, 2025, and not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 beginning September 30, 2025 through maturity; provided however, subject to certain limitations, if we make a Material Acquisition in any fiscal quarter after June 30, 2025, at our election, the maximum Leverage Ratio shall be 4.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter during which such Material Acquisition is consummated and the next three consecutive fiscal quarters; (b) a limitation of the amount of total secured obligations to 15 of our total consolidated assets; and (c) a limitation on our ability to sell, lease, transfer, or dispose of all, or substantially all, of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than accounts receivable sold in a Permitted Securitization Transaction, products sold in the ordinary course of business and our ability to sell, lease, transfer, or dispose of any of our assets or the assets of one of our subsidiaries to us or one of our subsidiaries, as applicable) at any given point in time. We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at the end of third quarter 2024 and we expect to maintain compliance in the future. For more information about long-term debt, please see Note I on page 95 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Form 10-K filed February 27, 2024. 
 Our credit facility serves as back-up for our commercial paper program. At September 30, 2024, we had 84 million commercial paper outstanding and had no borrowing under the credit facility. As our trailing 12-month Consolidated EBITDA, Unrestricted Cash, and debt levels change, our borrowing capacity increases or decreases. Based on our trailing 12-month Consolidated EBITDA, Unrestricted Cash, and debt levels at September 30, 2024, our borrowing capacity under the credit facility was 471 million. However, this may not be indicative of the actual borrowing capacity moving forward, which may be materially different depending on our Consolidated EBITDA, Unrestricted Cash, debt levels, and leverage ratio requirements at that time. 
 
 Long-Term Debt (including Current Maturities) 
 We have total debt of 1.9 billion. The maturities of the long-term debt range from 2024 through 2051. Our next scheduled maturity of outstanding debt is our 300 million 3.8 Senior Notes due in November 2024, which we expect to retire predominantly with commercial paper. We expect lower interest expense as we deleverage, but at current interest rates and commercial paper balances, interest costs would increase by approximately 4 million on an annualized basis, or if we are required to refinance commercial paper under our credit facility our interest costs would increase by approximately 7 million on an annualized basis related to the 
 39 

retirement. For more details on long-term debt, please refer to Footnote I to our Consolidated Financial Statements on page 95 in our Form 10-K filed February 27, 2024. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures. If we used different estimates or judgments, our financial statements could change. Some of these changes could be significant. Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate. Estimates are adjusted for actual events as they occur. 
 Critical accounting estimates are those that are: (a) subject to uncertainty and change and (b) of material impact to our financial statements. There were no newly identified critical accounting policies or estimates in the first nine months of 2024, and there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed beginning on page 54 in our Form 10-K filed February 27, 2024. 
 
 CONTINGENCIES 
 
 Litigation 
 Litigation Contingencies 
 We are exposed to litigation contingencies that, if realized, could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Although we deny liability in all currently threatened or pending litigation proceedings, we have recorded an immaterial aggregate litigation contingency accrual at September 30, 2024 (which does not include accrued expenses related to workers' compensation, vehicle-related personal injury, product and general liability claims, taxation issues, and environmental matters). Based on current known facts, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable, and therefore, not accrued) losses in excess of accruals for litigation contingencies are estimated to be 14 million . I f our assumptions or analyses regarding any of our contingencies are incorrect, or if facts change or future litigation arises, we could realize losses in excess of the recorded accruals (including losses in excess of the 14 million referenced above), which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Also, we could be subject to future litigation of various types (including, but not limited to, litigation related to employment, intellectual property, environmental, taxation, vehicle-related personal injury, climate change, and others) that could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For more information regarding our litigation contingencies, see Item 1 Legal Proceedings on page 45 and Note O Contingencies on page 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 Climate Change 
 Transition Risks 
 Change in Laws, Policies, and Regulations. Many scientists, legislators, and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit such emissions. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 120 production facilities in 18 countries. We also maintain a fleet of over-the-road tractor trailers that emit GHG. Our manufacturing facilities are primarily located in North America, Europe, and Asia. There are certain transition risks (meaning risks related to the process of reducing our carbon footprint) that could materially affect our business, capital expenditures, compliance costs, results of operations, financial condition, competitive position, and reputation. One of these transition risks is the change in treaties, laws, policies, and regulations that could impose significant operational and compliance burdens. For example, some of our operations are subject to certain governmental actions like the EU European Green Deal (which provides for a 55 reduction in net GHG emissions by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels), and no net emissions of GHG by 2050), and the Paris Agreement (which is an international treaty on climate change designed to lower GHG emissions). 
 40 

Other laws that could materially increase our compliance costs are the California Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, as well as the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, and the EU regulation on Deforestation-free Products. In addition, with respect to our Automotive Group, the EU is moving forward with an effective ban on the sale of new gas-powered automobiles (with the exception of CO2-neutral automobiles) in the EU from 2035 (with interim requirements by 2030), aiming to accelerate the conversion to zero-GHG emission automobiles as part of a broad package to combat global warming. Also, President Biden signed executive orders setting the goal of having zero-emission vehicles account for half of all new U.S. passenger car and light truck sales by 2030 and committing the Federal government to procuring only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. Finally, some states, including California and New York, are also implementing similar provisions. Our automotive products can be sold to manufacturers of either gas-powered or electric-powered vehicles. However, if our customers (who may be subject to any of these or other similarly proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations) incur additional costs to comply with such laws and regulations, which in turn, impact their ability to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions, the demand for our products could be adversely affected. Also, overall, there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. If these laws or regulations (including the SEC s recently adopted climate-related disclosure rules, if upheld) impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on us, they could increase costs associated with our operations, including costs for raw materials and transportation. Non-compliance with climate change treaties, legislative, and regulatory requirements could also negatively impact our reputation. To date, however, we have not experienced a material impact from climate change legislative and regulatory efforts. 
 Market Transition. We are engaged in the manufacture of various automotive components, including mechanical and pneumatic lumbar support and massage systems for seating, seat suspension systems, motors and actuators, and cables. For several decades, automotive manufacturers have sought lightweight components designed to increase fuel efficiency in the automobiles they manufacture. Replacing traditional steel components with high-strength steel, magnesium, aluminum alloys, carbon fiber, polymer composites, or post-consumer grade recycled nylon and plastics can directly reduce the weight of a vehicle's body and chassis and therefore reduce a vehicle's fuel consumption. This increased fuel efficiency also indirectly reduces GHG emissions. Because of our technological competitiveness, this long-standing market transition has not had, and is not expected to have, a material negative impact on our share of the markets in which we compete. However, if we are unable to continue to react to changes in technology, successfully develop, engineer, and bring to market new and innovative products, or successfully respond to evolving business trends, including continuing to produce comparatively lightweight components, our share in these automotive markets could be negatively impacted. 
 Physical Climate Change Risks 
 Direct Physical Effects. The acute and chronic physical effects of climate change, such as severe weather-related events, natural disasters, and/or significant changes in climate patterns, could have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and customers. As mentioned above, at September 30, 2024, we had approximately 120 manufacturing facilities in 18 countries, primarily located in North America, Europe, and Asia. We serve thousands of customers worldwide. In 2023, our largest customer represented less than 6 of our sales, and our customers were located in approximately 100 countries. Although our diverse geographical manufacturing footprint and our broad geographical customer base mitigate the potential physical risks of any local or regional climate change weather-related event having a material effect on our operations and results, the increased frequency and severity of such weather-related events could pose a risk to our operations and results. 
 To continue improving our climate-related risk assessment processes, we use technology-based tools to monitor our property portfolio s exposure to certain natural catastrophic events. We integrated climate-related risk into our enterprise risk management process, providing an opportunity to improve our internal processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks. In April 2023, we experienced tornado damage to a shared Home Furniture and Bedding facility in Mississippi. This event did not have a material impact on our physical properties as a whole, or our overall ability to manufacture and distribute our products to customers in a timely fashion, and it did not have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. However, in the future, depending on whether severe weather-related events increase in frequency and severity, such events could result in potential damage to our physical assets, local infrastructure, 
 41 

transportation systems, water delivery systems, our customers or suppliers operations, as well as prolonged disruptions in our manufacturing operations (including, but not limited to, our steel rod mill), all of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Indirect Physical Effects. The physical effects of climate change could continue to have an adverse impact on our supply chain. In recent years, we experienced (due, in part, to severe weather-related impacts) supply shortages in chemicals, which restricted foam supply. The restriction of foam supply constrained overall mattress production in the bedding industry and reduced our production levels. The cost of chemicals and foam also increased due to the shortages. Severe weather impacts could also reduce supply of other products in our supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them. If we are unable to secure an adequate and timely supply of raw materials or products in our supply chain, or the cost of these raw materials or products materially increases, it could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 In 2023, drought conditions lowered the water levels of the Mississippi River and Panama Canal, reducing traffic through these waterways. Although these issues have not had a material impact on our results of operations, additional logistical disruptions including, but not limited to, natural disasters, could result in additional costs and delays in our ability to deliver products timely to certain customers. 
 In addition, although the cost has not been, and is not expected to be, material to our business, results of operations, and financial condition, severe weather-related incidents have resulted and may, in the future, result in increased costs of our property insurance. 
 GHG Reduction Strategy 
 To date, we have not experienced material climate-related compliance costs. However, evaluating opportunities to reduce our carbon footprint, setting goals for carbon reduction, and measuring performance in achieving those goals are part of our sustainability and corporate governance strategy moving forward. We have completed our 2023 GHG emissions inventory. To ensure our information is complete and accurate, we engaged a third-party limited assurance provider to review our 2023 data. Our emissions inventory includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. We considered the principles and guidance of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance in preparing our 2023 GHG emissions inventory. As of 2023, our total GHG emissions were 25 less than our combined Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions inventory compared to our baseline year of 2019, which generally correlates with our decrease in production and volume over the same time period. 
 Our baseline measurement will inform a long-term GHG reduction strategy, including setting reduction targets and other key performance areas. Our key initiatives as we move through 2024, 2025, and into 2026 include: developing our emissions reduction pathways to reduce GHG emissions, undertaking our first Scope 3 emissions inventory, assessing where emission reduction opportunities lie within our value chain, and preparing for and complying with new reporting requirements. As we evaluate our GHG emissions, we recognize the importance of understanding the impact of our emissions across our value chain. We expect to compile a full emissions inventory, including Scope 3, to inform the setting of a science-aligned carbon reduction target. We currently do not have an estimate of the capital expenditures or operating costs that may be required to implement our GHG reduction strategy. While implementing our GHG reduction strategy is expected to require capital investment and increase operational costs, the ultimate impact and associated cost cannot be predicted at this time. For more information regarding our GHG reduction strategy, see our Sustainability Report at www.leggett.com. Our Sustainability Report does not constitute part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Cybersecurity Risks 
 We rely on information systems to obtain, process, analyze, and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities. We receive, process, and ship orders, manage the billing of and collections from our customers, and manage the accounting for and payment to our vendors. We also manage our production processes with certain industrial control systems. Consequently, we are subject to cybersecurity risk. 
 Although we have purchased broad form cyber insurance coverage and strive to provide a balanced level of cybersecurity protections, cybersecurity risk has increased due to remote access, remote work conditions, and increased sophistication of cybersecurity adversaries, as well as the increased frequency of cybersecurity attacks. As such, information technology failures or cybersecurity breaches could still create system disruptions 
 42 

or unauthorized disclosure or alterations of confidential information and disruptions to the systems of our third-party suppliers and providers. We cannot be certain that the attacker s capabilities will not compromise our technology protecting information systems or bypass our detection capabilities, including those resulting from ransomware attached to our industrial control systems. If these systems are interrupted or damaged by any incident or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected. We may incur remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information, litigation and legal costs, increased insurance premiums, reputational damage, damage to our competitiveness, and negative impact on our stock price and long-term shareholder value. We may also be required to devote significant management resources and expend significant additional resources to address problems created by any such interruption, damage, or failure. 
 For more information regarding cybersecurity risks, refer to Information Technology and Cybersecurity Risk Factors on page 53. 
 
 Goodwill and Long-Lived Asset Impairment Testing 
 A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. At September 30, 2024, goodwill and other intangible assets represented 1.0 billion, or 26 of our total assets. In addition, net property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and sundry assets totaled 1.1 billion, or 29 of total assets. 
 As discussed in Major Factors that Impact our Business on page 24, we recorded a 675 million non-cash impairment of goodwill in the second quarter of 2024. 
 In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic performance, as well as our future sales and operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. We are continuing to monitor all factors impacting these reporting units. If actual results or the long-term outlook of any of our reporting units materially differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and other long-lived assets valuation calculations, we could incur future impairment charges. These non-cash charges could have a material negative impact on our earnings. 
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 The FASB has issued accounting guidance effective for the current and future periods. See Note A Interim Presentation to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements on page 9 for a more complete discussion. 
 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Interest Rates 
 Substantially all of our debt is denominated in United States dollars. The fair value of fixed rate debt was approximately 190.0 million less than carrying value of 1,787.9 million at September 30, 2024 and approximately 175.0 million less than carrying value of 1,786.4 million at December 31, 2023. The fair value of fixed rate debt was based on quoted market prices in an active market. The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount. 
 
 Investment in Foreign Subsidiaries 
 We view our investment in foreign subsidiaries as a long-term commitment. This investment may take the form of either permanent capital or notes. Our net investment (i.e., total assets less total liabilities subject to translation exposure) in foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar was 1,056.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 1,202.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 43 

Derivative Financial Instruments 
 We are subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates and foreign currency. In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to reduce or eliminate these risks. We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments. Information regarding cash flow hedges and fair value hedges is provided in Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Form 10-K filed February 27, 2024 and Note N Derivative Financial Instruments beginning on page 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference into this section.

 MATTRESS ANTIDUMPING MATTERS 
 Petition Regarding China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Serbia, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam. On March 31, 2020, the Company, along with six other domestic mattress producers, Brooklyn Bedding LLC, Corsicana Mattress Company, Elite Comfort Solutions (a Leggett subsidiary), FXI, Inc., Innocor, Inc., and Kolcraft Enterprises, Inc., and two labor unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO (collectively, 2020 Petitioners), filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) alleging that manufacturers of mattresses in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Serbia, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam were unfairly selling their products in the United States at less than fair value and manufacturers of mattresses in China were unfairly benefiting from subsidies, causing harm to the U.S. industry and seeking the imposition of duties on mattresses imported from these countries. 
 These petitions resulted in antidumping and countervailing duty orders imposing duties ranging from 2.22 to 763.28 on mattresses imported from China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Serbia, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam for five years, through May 2026, at which time the DOC and ITC will conduct a sunset review to determine whether to extend the order for an additional five years. 
 Following certain appeals that were filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), some of which remain ongoing, the CIT ruled in favor of the ITC and 2020 Petitioners and sustained the ITC s unanimous injury decision. On February 15, 2024, one respondent filed an appeal of the CIT's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but agreed to dismiss the appeal on October 29, 2024. 
 Petition Regarding Indonesia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Burma, India, Italy, Kosovo, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, and Taiwan. On July 28, 2023, the Company, along with nine other domestic mattress producers, Brooklyn Bedding LLC, Carpenter Company, Corsicana Mattress Company, Future Foam, Inc., FXI, Inc., Kolcraft Enterprises Inc., Serta Simmons Bedding, LLC, Southerland Inc., and Tempur Sealy International, and two labor unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO (collectively, 2023 Petitioners), filed petitions with the DOC and the ITC alleging that manufacturers of mattresses in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Burma, India, Italy, Kosovo, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, and Taiwan were unfairly selling their products in the United States at less than fair value and manufacturers of mattresses in Indonesia were unfairly benefiting from subsidies, causing harm to the U.S. industry and seeking the imposition of duties on mattresses imported from these countries. The ITC made a preliminary determination of injury on September 11, 2023. On December 26, 2023, the DOC made a negative preliminary determination regarding Indonesian subsidies. The DOC s preliminary determination on dumping was issued February 26, 2024 and imposed duties on finished mattresses. With respect to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Burma, Italy, Philippines, Poland, Slovenia, and Taiwan, the DOC s final determinations were issued on May 9, 2024, and imposed duties ranging from 106.27 to 744.81 on finished mattresses. The ITC s final determination with respect to those countries was issued on June 11, 2024. With respect to Indonesia, India, Kosovo, Mexico, and Spain, the DOC s final determinations were issued July 16, 2024, and (excluding Indonesia) imposed duties ranging from 4.61 to 344.70 . Regarding Indonesia, the DOC found that the subsidies were below the de minimis threshold. The order evidencing the ITC s final determination as to India, Kosovo, Mexico, and Spain was issued in September 2024.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 27, 2024 includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors in Item 1A Risk Factors which is incorporated herein by reference. The information presented below updates and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information disclosed in that Form 10-K. 
 Investing in our securities involves risk. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We may amend or supplement these Risk Factors from time to time by other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS 
 Our Restructuring Plan may not achieve its intended outcomes, and we may incur restructuring costs, restructuring-related costs, and impairments in addition to those anticipated to be incurred in connection with our announced Restructuring Plan. 
 In the first quarter of 2024, we committed to a restructuring plan, primarily associated with our Bedding Products segment and, to a lesser extent, our Furniture, Flooring Textile Products segment (the Restructuring Plan or Plan ), which is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2025. The Plan was expanded in the second quarter of 2024 to include a restructuring opportunity within the Specialized Products segment and in the third quarter of 2024 to include the general and administrative cost structure initiatives. Pursuant to the Plan, we expect to: 
 consolidate between 15 and 20 production and distribution facilities (out of 50) in the Bedding Products segment and a small number of production facilities in the Furniture, Flooring Textile Products segment; 
 incur restructuring and restructuring-related costs between 65 and 85 million, of which 40 to 50 million are anticipated to be incurred in 2024 and the remainder in 2025. This includes 30 to 40 million in cash costs, the majority of which are anticipated to be incurred in 2024; 
 realize annualized EBIT benefit of 50 to 60 million after initiatives are fully implemented in late 2025 versus our prior estimate of 40 to 50 million, as we now expect to realize approximately a 10 million benefit in 2025 from general and administrative initiatives; 
 receive between 60 and 80 million in pretax net cash proceeds from the sale of real estate associated with the Restructuring Plan; and 
 experience a reduction in annual sales by approximately 80 million. 
 We continue to make solid progress executing the Plan. To date, we have consolidated 13 production and distribution facilities in the Bedding Products segment and two production facilities in the Furniture, Flooring Textile Products segment. All domestic innerspring production has been shifted into our four larger, remaining spring production facilities. We also downsized our Chinese innerspring operation and will exit our Mexican innerspring operation by year end, which will conclude all innerspring-related restructuring activity in Bedding Products. In Specialty Foam, we have closed three operations. In early fourth quarter we closed one Adjustable Bed location and shifted production to a more cost-advantaged facility. We successfully executed the restructuring activity in Home Furniture, and we expect to complete phase one of our Flooring Products restructuring by early next year. In Hydraulic Cylinders, manufacturing optimization and operational efficiency improvements are underway. 
 We initiated a thorough analysis of our general and administrative cost structure across our business units and corporate shared services. Our general and administrative project team is analyzing and identifying opportunities to drive efficiencies. We continue to analyze and identify potential opportunities within our business unit functions; however, we anticipate potential cost reductions will be smaller than those identified in our corporate functions. 
 We are also exploring a potential sale of our Aerospace business, which is not included in the Plan, and have incurred 1 million of restructuring-related costs in the third quarter of 2024 related to this activity. This business has not reached the criteria to be classified as held for sale. 
 Total restructuring and restructuring-related costs, including Plan costs and costs to explore the potential sale of our Aerospace business, for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024, were 12 million 
 46 

11 million cash and 1 million non-cash) and 34 million 27 million cash and 7 million non-cash), respectively. 
 We realized 6 million of EBIT benefit from the Plan in the third quarter and 9 million year to date. We still expect to realize approximately 10- 15 million of EBIT benefit in 2024. In the third quarter we realized 4 million of sales attrition and have realized 7 million of sales attrition year to date. We now expect sales attrition in 2024 of approximately 15 million versus our prior estimate of 25 million. 
 To date and in line with 2024 expectations, we have realized 20 million of proceeds from the sale of real estate associated with the Plan, including the sale of one facility in third quarter 2024 for net proceeds of 17 million (pretax gain of 14 million) and one facility in late October 2024 for net proceeds of 3 million (estimated pretax gain of 3 million). 
 Because of certain risks and uncertainties, the Plan may not achieve its intended outcomes. Our estimates of the number of facilities to be consolidated and the cash and non-cash costs and impairments associated with the Plan may change as our analysis develops and additional information is obtained. Also, we may not be able to implement the Plan in a timely manner that will positively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we may not be able to dispose of real estate pursuant to the Plan or obtain the expected proceeds in a timely manner. The Plan may also negatively impact our relationships with employees, customers, and vendors. Finally, because restructuring activities are complex and involve time-consuming processes, substantial demands may be placed on management, which could divert attention from other business priorities or disrupt our daily operations. Any failure to achieve the intended outcomes could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and liquidity. 
 We continue to evaluate our businesses for further restructuring opportunities in addition to those activities included in the announced Plan. The execution of any of these opportunities may result in additional material restructuring costs, restructuring-related costs, or impairments. 
 The physical effects of climate change could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Direct Physical Effects 
 The acute and chronic physical effects of climate change, such as severe weather-related events, natural disasters, and/or significant changes in climate patterns, could have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and customers. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 120 manufacturing facilities in 18 countries, primarily located in North America, Europe, and Asia. We serve thousands of customers worldwide. In 2023, our largest customer represented less than 6 of our sales, and our customers were located in approximately 100 countries. Although our diverse geographical manufacturing footprint and our broad geographical customer base mitigate the potential physical risks of any local or regional climate change weather-related event having a material effect on our operations and results, the increased frequency and severity of such weather-related events could pose a risk to our operations and results. 
 To continue improving our climate-related risk assessment processes, we use technology-based tools to monitor our property portfolio s exposure to certain natural catastrophic events. We integrated climate-related risk into our enterprise risk management process, providing an opportunity to improve our internal processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks. In April 2023, we experienced tornado damage to a shared Home Furniture and Bedding facility in Mississippi. This event did not have a material impact on our physical properties as a whole, or our overall ability to manufacture and distribute our products to customers in a timely fashion, and it did not have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. However, in the future, depending on whether severe weather-related events increase in frequency and severity, such events could result in potential damage to our physical assets, local infrastructure, transportation systems, water delivery systems, our customers or suppliers operations, as well as prolonged disruptions in our manufacturing operations (including, but not limited to, our steel rod mill), all of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Indirect Physical Effects 
 The physical effects of climate change could continue to have an adverse impact on our supply chain. In recent years, we experienced (due, in part, to severe weather-related impacts) supply shortages in chemicals, which restricted foam supply. The restriction of foam supply constrained overall mattress production in the bedding industry and reduced our production levels. The cost of chemicals and foam also increased due to the 
 47 

shortages. Severe weather impacts could also reduce supply of other products in our supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them. If we are unable to secure an adequate and timely supply of raw materials or products in our supply chain, or the cost of these raw materials or products materially increases, it could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 In 2023, drought conditions lowered the water levels of the Mississippi River and Panama Canal, reducing traffic through these waterways. Although these issues have not had a material impact on our results of operations, additional logistical disruptions including, but not limited to, natural disasters, could result in additional costs and delays in our ability to deliver products timely to certain customers. 
 In addition, although the cost has not been, and is not expected to be, material to our business, results of operations, and financial condition, severe weather-related incidents have resulted and may, in the future, result in increased costs of our property insurance. 
 Global economic, political, legal, and business factors could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 We operate in global markets. Approximately 39 of our sales in 2023 were generated outside the United States. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, we had 50 manufacturing facilities outside the United States, and approximately 31 of our tangible long-lived assets were located outside the United States. Our reliance on international sales and international manufacturing facilities exposes us to a number of risks, including price and currency controls; government embargoes or trade restrictions, including import and export tariffs; extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings, acts of terror, and riots; political instability; nationalization of private enterprises; hyperinflationary conditions; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations, currency conversion, or repatriation of assets; legal systems of decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations, and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; cost and availability of international labor, materials, and shipping channels; and customer loyalty to local companies. 
 Additionally, the growth of new Chinese auto market entrants and increases in Chinese auto exports, particularly to Europe, is driving further market disruption. Europe has responded by introducing new tariffs, but it is to be seen if this will slow the pace of Chinese imports. These Chinese imports have, and may continue to have, a negative impact to the demand for our automotive products. A Chinese OEM could displace one or more of our existing customers and elect an alternative domestic supplier, which could result in additional lost market share. In Europe, economic softness and consumer affordability issues have given Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers opportunities to supply lower price electric vehicles, leading to the production declines and program launch delays for our customers. In North America, consumer affordability issues and uncertainty around EV transition timelines is resulting in program launch delays and our customers replacing higher cost components with lower cost components. 
 These factors could result in, or could continue to result in, among other things, supply chain or production disruptions, lower consumer demand, compressed profit margins, and foreign exchange rate changes, any of which could materially negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 
 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS 
 There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock. 
 We recently lowered our quarterly cash dividend from .46 per share to .05 per share. Financial conditions or our pursuit of strategic alternative uses of cash could lead to a further reduction, suspension, or termination of the payment of cash dividends at any time. Dividends on shares of common stock are declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Any decision would consider general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows, capital requirements, strategic alternatives, our decision to reduce leverage, our compliance with our leverage ratio under our credit agreement, contractual, legal, and tax implications, and other factors. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock.

Our borrowing costs and access to liquidity may be impacted by lower credit ratings. 
 Independent rating agencies evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have assigned ratings for our long-term and short-term debt. Recently, our credit ratings have been lowered and could be lowered further. These recent downgrades have resulted in slightly higher credit spreads, and could impact marketability. Lower credit ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and our financial arrangements, including access to the commercial paper market, our lending agreements, and supply chain financing arrangements. If we are unable to meet our short-term borrowing needs in the commercial paper market, we may rely more heavily on bank debt to fund short-term working capital needs at higher interest costs. Any future downgrades of our credit ratings could also further increase our cost of debt and negatively impact our weighted average cost of capital. 
 Macroeconomic uncertainties have had, and could further have, an adverse impact on the collection of receivables in accordance with their terms due to customer bankruptcy, financial difficulties, or insolvency. 
 Some of our customers have been adversely affected by macroeconomic uncertainties and have suffered financial difficulty. Macroeconomic uncertainties may include, but are not limited to, rising interest rates, inflation, weak demand, changing market dynamics, increased geopolitical tensions, and political economic policy changes. As a result, our customers may be unable to pay their debts to us, they may reject their contractual obligations to us under bankruptcy laws or otherwise, or we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extend financing terms with these parties. 
 We monitor our receivable portfolio closely and make reserve decisions based upon individual customer credit risk reviews, customer payment trends (percentage of current and past due), historical loss experience, and general macroeconomic and industry trends that could impact the expected collectability of all customers or pools of customers with similar risk. We recorded bad debt expense of 9 million during the first nine months of 2024. Weak demand and changing market dynamics have created disruption and financial instability for some of our customers, particularly in the Bedding Products segment. A few of these customers began to exhibit slow payment and past-due trends during 2024. As a result, we increased our reserves for these customers and implemented payment plans where needed. We believe we have established appropriate reserves. As of September 30, 2024, our allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables was 17 million. If we are unable to collect receivables on a timely basis, larger provisions for bad debt may be required and may result in a negative impact on our earnings, liquidity, cash flow, and financial condition. 
 Our goodwill and other long-lived assets have been, and could further be, subject to impairment which could negatively impact our earnings. 
 A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. At September 30, 2024, goodwill and other intangible assets represented 1.0 billion, or 26 of our total assets. In addition, net property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and sundry assets totaled 1.1 billion, or 29 of total assets. 
 We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (the business groups that are one level below the operating segments) when triggering events occur, or at least annually. We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the second quarter. The 2023 goodwill impairment testing indicated no impairments. 
 The 2024 annual goodwill impairment testing indicated that fair value had fallen below carrying value for three reporting units, and fair value exceeded carrying value by less than 100 for one reporting unit. 
 A 675 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge was recorded related to the following reporting units: 
 Reporting Unit Segment Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Bedding Bedding Products 587.2 Work Furniture Furniture, Flooring Textile Products 44.5 Hydraulic Cylinders Specialized Products 43.6 675.3 
 49 

The fair values of our reporting units in relation to their respective carrying values and significant assumptions used are presented in the tables in Note F to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, beginning on page 15. 
 In general, the fair values for our reporting units decreased versus prior year due to macroeconomic pressures, including low demand, particularly in residential end markets. The fair values of our reporting units were reconciled to our consolidated market capitalization, which decreased due to the significant decline in stock price during the second quarter of 2024. Our closing stock price per share was 26.17 on December 29, 2023, 19.15 on March 28, 2024, and 11.46 on June 28, 2024. We concluded that an impairment existed under generally accepted accounting principles in connection with the preparation and review of our second quarter financial statements filed on August 7, 2024 as part of the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We do not expect that the impairment charge will result in any cash expenditures. 
 Units with Impairments 
 In addition to the decline in our stock price during the second quarter, the reporting units discussed below also had the following factors contributing to the impairments: 
 Bedding 
 Domestic bedding manufacturers are facing numerous challenges, including low demand, overcapacity, and increased pressure from finished mattress imports, resulting in financial stress across the industry. The domestic mattress market has changed dramatically in a relatively short time span. The landscape has shifted from a largely domestic OEM-produced innerspring mattress market to one where innerspring, foam, and hybrid mattresses are sold at a wide range of price points through a variety of channels and produced by a mix of fewer large domestic OEMs, domestic private label producers, and import manufacturers. These changing market dynamics and weak demand have created disruption and financial instability with some of our customers. 
 The Bedding reporting unit's fair value exceeded carrying value by 40 at our second quarter 2023 testing date. Late in the fourth quarter of 2023 we concluded we had a triggering event after certain of our Elite Comfort Solutions and Kayfoam customers notified us of efforts to improve their financial position by moving their business to or exploring alternative suppliers. We expected that these customer efforts would reduce our future cash flows. Accordingly, we performed a goodwill impairment test, which indicated no goodwill impairments. However, the estimated fair value of this reporting unit had decreased and fair value in excess of carrying value had dropped to 19 . 
 Work Furniture 
 Work Furniture demand for both contract and residential end-use products has remained at sustained low levels. Fair value exceeded carrying value by 74 at our second quarter 2023 testing date. 
 Hydraulic Cylinders 
 The Hydraulic Cylinders reporting unit's fair value at our second quarter 2023 testing date exceeded carrying value by 18 . Fair value approximated carrying value primarily due to an August 2022 acquisition that is experiencing operational inefficiencies. 
 Units with No Impairments, but Fair Value Exceeded Carrying Value by Less than 100 
 Aerospace Products 
 The Aerospace Products reporting unit did not incur impairment charges, but fair value exceeded carrying value by less than 100 at both testing dates. The fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 21 at our second quarter 2024 testing date as compared to 44 in 2023. Aerospace s long-term forecasts continue to reflect demand improvements as industry recovery continues. Current demand is now similar to pre-pandemic levels. 
 In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic performance, as well as our future sales and operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. We are continuing to monitor all factors impacting these reporting units. If actual results or the long-term outlook of any of our reporting units materially differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and other long-lived assets valuation 
 50 

calculations, we could incur future impairment charges. These non-cash charges could have a material negative impact on our earnings. 
 If we do not comply with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, we may not be able to borrow in the commercial paper market or under our credit facility and our outstanding debt instruments may default, all of which would adversely impact our liquidity. 
 Our credit facility is a multi-currency facility maturing in September 2026, providing us the ability, from time to time, to borrow, repay, and re-borrow up to 1.2 billion, subject to certain restrictive covenants and customary conditions. The credit facility serves as back-up for our commercial paper borrowing. 
 To provide additional borrowing capacity and financial flexibility, we amended our credit agreement in March 2024 to increase the Leverage Ratio from 3.50 to 1.00 to 4.00 to 1.00. After the amendment, our credit facility contains restrictive covenants which include (a) an amended Leverage Ratio requiring us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, or when we borrow under the credit facility (i) Consolidated Funded Indebtedness minus the lesser of: (A) Unrestricted Cash, or (B) 750 million to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA for the four consecutive trailing quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2024 through June 30, 2025, and not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 beginning September 30, 2025 through maturity; provided however, subject to certain limitations, if we make a Material Acquisition in any fiscal quarter after June 30, 2025, at our election, the maximum Leverage Ratio shall be 4.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter during which such Material Acquisition is consummated and the next three consecutive fiscal quarters; (b) a limitation of the amount of total secured obligations to 15 of our total consolidated assets; and (c) a limitation on our ability to sell, lease, transfer, or dispose of all, or substantially all, of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than accounts receivable sold in a Permitted Securitization Transaction, products sold in the ordinary course of business and our ability to sell, lease, transfer, or dispose of any of our assets or the assets of one of our subsidiaries to us or one of our subsidiaries, as applicable) at any given point in time. 
 If our earnings are reduced, the covenants in the credit facility will continue to reduce our borrowing capacity, both under the credit facility or through commercial paper issuances. Depending on the degree of earnings reduction, our liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. This covenant may also restrict our current and future operations, including (i) our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our businesses and industries; and (ii) our ability to use our cash flows, or obtain additional financing, for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes. If we are not in compliance with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, and are not able to negotiate more lenient terms, we may not be able to access the commercial paper market or borrow under the credit facility. 
 Also, if we fail to comply with the covenants specified in the credit facility, we may trigger an event of default, in which case the lenders would have the right to: (i) terminate their commitment to provide loans under the credit facility; and (ii) declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. Additionally, our senior notes contain cross-default provisions which could make outstanding amounts under the senior notes immediately payable in the event of an acceleration of amounts due under the credit facility following a material uncured default. If debt under the credit facility or senior notes were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash to repay this debt, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income. 
 Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income. As of September 30, 2024, we had 151 million of deferred tax assets 167 million less a 16 million valuation allowance). After netting of deferred tax liabilities, the net amount presented within Sundry assets on our Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets is 22 million. It is possible the amount and source of our taxable income could materially change in the future. Particularly, our mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction may materially change in that we may have more or less taxable income generated in North America, Europe, or Asia as compared to prior years. This change may impact our underlying assumptions on which valuation allowances are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets. As a result, we may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. 
 51 

MARKET RISK FACTORS 
 Unfair competition could adversely affect our market share, sales, profit margins, and earnings. 
 We produce innersprings for mattresses that are sold to bedding manufacturers. We produce steel wire rod for consumption by our wire mills (primarily to produce innersprings) and to sell to third parties. We also produce and sell finished mattresses. 
 In response to petitions filed with the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) generally alleging that innersprings, steel wire rod, and mattresses were being unfairly sold in the United States by certain foreign manufacturers at less than fair value (dumping) and that certain foreign manufacturers of steel wire rod and mattresses were unfairly benefiting from subsidies, certain antidumping and/or countervailing duties have been imposed on the imports of such products. Some antidumping and countervailing duties orders are subject to ongoing appeal. Some orders are set to expire in the upcoming months, at which time the DOC and ITC will conduct a sunset review to determine whether to extend the orders for an additional five years. If any of the antidumping and countervailing duties are overturned on appeal, or not extended beyond their current terms and dumping and/or subsidization recurs, or manufacturers in the subject countries circumvent the existing duties through transshipment in other jurisdictions or otherwise, our market share, sales, profit margins, and earnings could be adversely affected. 
 For more information on antidumping and/or countervailing duties regarding innersprings, steel wire rod and mattresses, please refer to the Competition section on page 28 in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations of this Form 10-Q, and Item 1 Legal Proceedings on page 45 of this Form 10-Q. 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness, profit margins, and earnings. 
 International sales have represented a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2023, 39 of our sales were generated by international operations, primarily in Europe, China, Canada, and Mexico. We expect that a significant amount of our sales will continue to come from outside the United States in the future. As of December 31, 2023, 50 of our manufacturing facilities were located outside the United States. We are also exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations by our purchase of raw materials and component parts from suppliers in multiple countries. We experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We also have balance sheet, cash flow, and net investment risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates. If the applicable foreign currency exchange rates devalue the currency we receive for the sale of our products, or the currency we use to purchase raw materials or component parts from our suppliers, it may have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness, profit margins, and earnings. 
 For more information regarding currency exchange rate risk, please refer to Note N on page 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 
 Higher interest rates have affected, and could continue to affect, our interest expense and make it more costly to refinance our long-term debt. 
 We have borrowed money by issuing commercial paper with maturities of less than 270 days. We also have issued long-term senior notes with fixed interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.9 billion of debt outstanding. Our next scheduled maturity of outstanding debt is our 300 million 3.8 Senior Notes due in November 2024, which we expect to retire predominantly with commercial paper. Credit spreads on commercial paper have widened to some extent, which has contributed to an increase in interest expense. Further increases in interest rates, or the need to refinance outstanding commercial paper through our credit facility, could continue to negatively impact our interest expense, and make it more costly to refinance our outstanding senior notes. 
 52 

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CYBERSECURITY RISK FACTORS 
 Information technology failures, cybersecurity incidents, or new technology disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 We have approximately 120 production facilities in 18 countries, primarily located in North America, Europe, and Asia. We rely on information systems to obtain, process, analyze, and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities. We receive, process, and ship orders, manage the billing of and collections from our customers, and manage the accounting for and payment to our vendors. We also manage our production processes with certain industrial control systems. Consequently, we are subject to cybersecurity risk. We also have risk associated with the network connectivity and systems for consolidated reporting. Technology failures or security breaches of a new or existing infrastructure, including our industrial control systems, could impede normal operations, create system disruptions, or create unauthorized disclosure or alteration of confidential information. 
 Our cybersecurity program is based on industry-recognized frameworks and takes a multifaceted approach to protecting our network, systems, and data, including personal information. We deploy a wide range of protective security technologies and tools, including, but not limited to, encryption, firewalls, endpoint detection and response, security information and event management, 24/7 security operations center, multi-factor authentication, and threat intelligence feeds. 
 From time to time, we have experienced immaterial cybersecurity threats and incidents. When these threats and incidents occur, we have taken appropriate remediation steps and, through investigation (as more fully described below), determined that the threats or incidents did not have a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial results. Although we are not aware of any material cybersecurity incidents, because of past immaterial cybersecurity threats and what we have learned in responding to those threats, we have improved cybersecurity efforts, including expansion of resources. Between 2023 and 2024, we expect to spend roughly 15 million in maintaining and enhancing our cybersecurity protection efforts. 
 Cybersecurity alerts are monitored by our security operations center. When a cybersecurity alert meets certain categorized thresholds, as determined by our Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, we follow an escalation review process which can result in our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) forwarding the alert to the crisis response team consisting of our CEO, CFO, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Information Officer, and General Counsel. Our CISO and the Crisis Response Team, pursuant to guidance from our CISO, assess and manage our response to cybersecurity threats and incidents. Our CISO follows a risk-based escalation process to notify our General Counsel of certain cybersecurity threats and incidents, and our General Counsel analyzes our obligation to report any incident publicly. If the General Counsel determines disclosure is warranted, she reports this conclusion to the CISO, the Crisis Response Team, and the Company's Public Disclosure Committee for consideration and disclosure. In addition, our CISO (or CFO when warranted) reports cybersecurity activity to the Board of Directors quarterly, with procedures in place for interim reporting, if necessary. Our full Board has oversight of our cybersecurity process. 
 Although we have purchased broad form cyber insurance coverage and strive to provide a balanced level of cybersecurity protections, cybersecurity risk has increased due to remote access, remote work conditions, and increased sophistication of cybersecurity adversaries, as well as the increased frequency of cybersecurity attacks. As such, information technology failures or cybersecurity breaches could still create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure or alterations of confidential information and disruptions to the systems of our third-party suppliers and providers. We cannot be certain that the attacker s capabilities will not compromise our technology protecting information systems or bypass our detection capabilities, including those resulting from ransomware attached to our industrial control systems. If these systems are interrupted or damaged by any incident or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected. We may incur remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information, litigation and legal costs, increased insurance premiums, reputational damage, damage to our competitiveness, and negative impact on our stock price and long-term shareholder value. We may also be required to devote significant management resources and expend significant additional resources to address problems created by any such interruption, damage, or failure. 
 In addition, our ability to effectively compete may be impacted by our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the opportunity and threat presented by new technology disruption and developments, including artificial intelligence. 
 53 

Finally, burdens associated with regulatory compliance, including regulations adopted by the SEC regarding cybersecurity disclosure, may increase our costs. 
 The unauthorized use of artificial intelligence could expose sensitive Company information, infringe intellectual property rights, violate privacy laws, and harm our reputation. 
 Our business uses artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including those offered by third parties, on a limited basis, generally to mitigate cybersecurity risks. While we prohibit the use of unauthorized AI technologies, our employees may use AI in an unauthorized manner, which could expose our sensitive data to disclosure, violate third-party intellectual property rights, violate privacy laws, produce inaccurate responses that could lead to errors in our business activities, and ultimately harm our reputation. Our ability to mitigate these risks will depend on our continued effective maintenance, training, monitoring, and enforcement of appropriate policies governing the use of AI technologies, and the results of any such use, by us. The legal and regulatory landscape relating to AI and the use of AI is uncertain and rapidly evolving, requiring us to stay apprised of such developments. These evolving laws and regulations could require changes in our implementation of AI technology and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. If any of these risks are realized, it could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow, financial condition, and stock price. 
 
 REGULATORY RISK FACTORS 
 Privacy and data protection regulations are complex and could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 
 Governments around the world have adopted legislative and regulatory rules concerning the collection and use of personal data. As a multinational company with employee personal data and business contact information from individuals in many countries, we are subject to many different data protection laws, including federal and state-specific laws in the U.S., and the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, such as those in Europe, China, India, and Brazil. For example, the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Switzerland new Federal Act on Data Protection (nFADP), and United Kingdom (UK) GDPR apply to our operations that collect or process personal data of EU, Swiss, and UK individuals, respectively. If our operations are found to violate these broad-ranging European laws, we may incur substantial fines, face reputational harm, and be required to change our business practices, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 As a U.S. company, the ability to manage aspects of our operation and workforce centrally and the ability to make decisions based on complete and accurate global data are important and require the ability to transfer and access personal data. The adequacy of the laws of the data-importing country are of increasing importance under various international laws. The validity of data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in many countries and could have an adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data. This may inhibit our ability to transfer our employee personal data from our other operations, such as in Europe, China, and Brazil, to our headquarters in the U.S. or elsewhere, making it much more difficult to effectively manage our global human capital. These evolving privacy and data protection requirements create uncertainty and added compliance obligations that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 
 Environmental regulatory compliance costs, additional potential related liabilities and climate change transition risks, including new treaties, laws, and regulations, could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, compliance costs, results of operations, financial condition, competitive position, and reputation. 
 Increased focus by the U.S. and other governmental authorities on climate change and other environmental matters has led to enhanced regulation in these areas, which is expected to result in increased compliance costs and could subject us to potential liabilities. The extent of these costs and risks is difficult to predict and will depend, in large part, on the extent of final regulations and the ways in which those regulations are enforced. 
 We have approximately 120 manufacturing facilities in 18 countries, primarily located in North America, Europe, and Asia. Most of our facilities are engaged in manufacturing processes that produce GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide. We also maintain a fleet of over-the-road tractor trailers that emit GHG emissions when providing freight services to many of our U.S.-based manufacturing locations. There are certain transition 
 54 

risks (meaning risks related to the process of reducing our carbon footprint) that could materially affect our business, capital expenditures, compliance costs, results of operations, financial condition, competitive position, and reputation. One of these transition risks is the change in treaties, laws, policies, and regulations that could impose significant operational and compliance burdens. For example, some of our operations are subject to certain governmental actions like the EU European Green Deal (which provides for a 55 reduction in net GHG emissions by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels), and no net emissions of GHG by 2050), and the Paris Agreement (which is an international treaty on climate change designed to lower GHG emissions). 
 Other laws that could materially increase our compliance costs are the California Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, as well as the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, and the EU regulation on Deforestation-free Products. In addition, with respect to our Automotive Group, the EU is moving forward with an effective ban on the sale of new gas-powered automobiles (with the exception of CO2-neutral automobiles) in the EU from 2035 (with interim requirements by 2030), aiming to accelerate the conversion to zero-GHG emission automobiles as part of a broad package to combat global warming. Also, President Biden signed executive orders setting the goal of having zero-emission vehicles account for half of all new U.S. passenger car and light truck sales by 2030 and committing the Federal government to procuring only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. Finally, some states, including California and New York, are also implementing similar provisions. Our automotive products can be sold to manufacturers of either gas-powered or electric-powered vehicles. However, if our customers (who may be subject to any of these or other similarly proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations) incur additional costs to comply with such laws and regulations, which in turn, impact their ability to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions, the demand for our products could be adversely affected. 
 In addition, overall, there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. If these laws or regulations (including the SEC's recently adopted climate-related disclosure rules, if upheld) impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on us, they could increase costs associated with our operations, including costs for raw materials and transportation. Non-compliance with climate change treaties or legislative and regulatory requirements could also lead to significant fines and penalties and negatively impact our reputation. To date, we have not experienced a material impact from climate change legislative and regulatory efforts. Further, we currently do not have an estimate of the capital expenditures or operating and administrative costs that may be required to implement our GHG reduction strategy or comply with regulatory requirements, but these items are expected to require capital investment and increase costs. The ultimate impact and associated cost of these legislative and regulatory developments and implementing our GHG reduction strategy cannot be predicted at this time. 
 Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax positions pursuant to ongoing tax audits could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows. 
 We are subject to the tax laws and reporting rules of the U.S. (federal, state, and local) and several foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make these tax rules (and governmental interpretation of these rules) in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change and uncertainty. There are proposals by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the European Union, and other tax jurisdictions, some of which were already adopted in various countries, to reform tax laws or change interpretations of existing tax rules. These proposals generally center around global base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) concepts, and as they are adopted, could continue to impact how our earnings and transactions are taxed as a multinational corporation. Whether, or in what form, these proposals will become law in various countries around the world, or how such laws might be interpreted, could impact our assumptions related to the taxation of certain foreign earnings and have an adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. 
 We are subject to audit by taxing authorities in the countries where we operate and are currently in various stages of examination in several of these jurisdictions. We have established liabilities as we believe are appropriate, with such amounts representing what we believe is a reasonable provision for taxes that we ultimately might be required to pay. However, these liabilities could be increased over time as more information becomes known relative to the resolution of these audits, as either certain governmental tax positions may be sustained, or we may agree to certain tax adjustments. We could incur additional tax expense if we have adjustments higher than the liabilities recorded. 
 We are subject to value-added taxes (VAT) in various foreign jurisdictions. Where we are entitled to a refund of the VAT we have paid, we are required to make a claim for refund from the government authorities. 
 55 

We establish VAT receivables for these claims, but have been experiencing refund delays in Mexico. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding VAT refund claims with the Mexican government of 36 million. Although we believe the amounts we have claimed are fully collectable, continued government actions in Mexico, including audits of the amounts we have requested, could either further delay the receipt of our refunds, or cause us to settle for a lesser amount than the VAT receivable we have recorded. These actions could adversely impact our future cash flows and/or pretax earnings. 
 
 LITIGATION RISK FACTORS 
 We are exposed to litigation contingencies that, if realized, could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Although we deny liability in all currently threatened or pending litigation proceedings, we have recorded an immaterial aggregate litigation contingency accrual at September 30, 2024. Based on current facts and circumstances, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the recorded accruals for litigation contingencies are estimated to be 14 million. If our assumptions or analyses regarding any of our contingencies are incorrect, if facts and circumstances change, or if future litigation arises, we could realize losses in excess of the recorded accruals (and in excess of the 14 million referenced above) which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For more information regarding our legal contingencies, please see Item 1 Legal Proceedings on page 45 and Note O Contingencies on page 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.

 2 On August 7, 2024, the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to 10 million shares each calendar year. This standing authorization was first announced on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, filed August 7, 2024, and will remain in force until repealed by the Board of Directors. This standing Board authorization replaced the prior Board authorization adopted in 2022, which provided the same repurchase authority to the Company with only minor administrative differences. We substantively have had the same share repurchase authority since 2004, and this authority includes the 2024 calendar year. No specific repurchase schedule has been established. The authority does not obligate the Company to purchase a minimum number of shares.

The Company s Restated Articles of Incorporation and Certificate of Elimination are attached as Exhibit 3.1.1 and Exhibit 3.1.2 , respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. 
 CHANGES TO BYLAWS 
 On November 5, 2024, the Board amended the Company s Bylaws, effective immediately, to eliminate an outdated reference to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ). The Bylaws contained a provision that allowed the Company to exclude a proxy access shareholder nominee for election as a director in its proxy materials for any annual meeting of shareholders, or if the proxy statement has already been filed, to exclude the nomination of (or a vote with respect to) a shareholder nominee for director, if such nominee was not an outside director for the purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code. The Board removed this exclusion in light of amendments to Section 162(m) which rendered it inapplicable to the Company for this purpose. A marked version of the amended Bylaw provisions, and a clean version of the Company s Bylaws, as amended effective November 5, 2024, is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2.1 and Exhibit 3.2.2 , respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

 (3) For the purposes of determining whether a person is an Acquiring Person, such person shall be deemed to beneficially own (i) all shares of Common Stock with respect to which such person has the capability to control or influence the voting power in respect thereof and (ii) all shares of Common Stock which such person has the immediate or future right to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to agreements, through the exercise of options, warrants or rights or through the conversion of convertible securities or otherwise and all shares of Common Stock which such person has the right to acquire in such manner shall be deemed to be outstanding shares, but shares of Common Stock which any other person has the right to acquire in such manner shall not be deemed to be outstanding shares. 
 
 (4) The term tender offer, as used herein, shall mean a tender offer within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 
 (5) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) (2) herein, outstanding shares shall mean shares of Common Stock which at the time in question have been issued by the corporation and not reacquired and held or retired by it or held by any subsidiary of the corporation.

 (ii) securities that are convertible into shares of Common Stock immediately or within forty-five days following the Record Date and 
 
 (iii) options, warrants or rights that are exercisable to acquire shares of Common Stock immediately or within forty-five days following the Record Date

 (2) In the event shares of Common Stock are subject to redemption in accordance with this Section 4, the Board of Directors of the corporation shall designate a Redemption Agent, which shall be a corporation or association (i) organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any State, (ii) subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority, (iii) having combined capital and surplus of at least 5,000,000 and (iv) having the power to exercise corporate trust powers. 
 
 (3) For a period of forty-five days from the date of the mailing of the Shareholder Notice to persons entitled thereto pursuant to this subsection (c), persons entitled to have shares of Common Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section 4 may , at their option, deposit certificates representing all or less than all shares of Common Stock held of record by them with the Redemption Agent together with written notice that the holder elects to have such shares redeemed pursuant to this Section 4. The Company shall redeem all shares delivered for redemption allowable under Missouri law, on a pro rata basis (except that no fractional shares shall be redeemed), and the shares so redeemed shall no longer be considered outstanding as of the close of business on the day certificates evidencing such shares are deposited in

 (4) The corporation shall deposit in trust with the Redemption Agent, as soon as possible, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Redemption Price of all of the shares of Common Stock redeemed. 
 
 (5) As soon as practicable after receipt by the Redemption Agent of cash deposited by the corporation pursuant to subsection (4) immediately above, the Redemption Agent shall issue its checks payable to the order of the persons entitled to receive the Redemption Price of the shares of Common Stock redeemed. If the amount of cash so received by the Redemption Agent at any one time is not sufficient to pay the aggregate Redemption Price to which all such persons are entitled, the Redemption Agent shall pay each such person a pro rata part of the amount to which he is entitled. 
 
 (6) In the event the entire Redemption Price has not been paid for all shares received by the Redemption Agent within thirty (30) days following the last day shareholders are entitled to deposit shares for redemption as provided in subsection (c) (3) hereof, then each shareholder who has not received the full Redemption Price for any of such shares shall be entitled to receive interest on the unpaid portion of the Redemption Price due him at the rate of 18 per annum or the highest rate of interest allowed by applicable law, whichever is less, from the expiration of said thirty (30) day period until the Redemption Price is paid in full. All funds paid by the Redemption Agent shall be allocated first to accrued and unpaid interest and then to the Redemption Price.

For purposes of subpart (i) of this subsection (d) (1), if the consideration paid in any such acquisition of shares consisted, in whole or part, of consideration other than cash, the Board of Directors of the corporation shall take such action, as in its judgment it deems appropriate, to establish the cash value of such consideration, but such valuation shall not be less than the cash value, if any, ascribed to such consideration by the Acquiring Person. For purposes of this subpart (ii) of subsection (d) (1), the price on the Record Date shall be the highest sale price per Common Share traded on the New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange on the Record Date or, if Common Shares are not then traded on a national securities exchange, the mean of the highest bid and highest asked prices per Common Share quoted in the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System on the Record Date. 
 
 (2) The determinations to be made pursuant to this Section 4 shall be made by the Board of Directors not later than the date of the Shareholder Notice referred to in subsection (c) hereof. In making such determination, the Board of Directors may engage such persons, including investment banking firms and the independent accountants who have reported on the most recent financial statements of the corporation, and utilize employees and agents of the corporation who will, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, be of assistance to the Board of Directors. 
 
 (3) The determinations to be made pursuant to this Section 4, when made by the Board of Directors acting in good faith on the basis of such information and assistance as was then reasonably available for such purpose, shall be conclusive and binding upon the corporation and its shareholders, including any person referred to in subsection (c) hereof. 
 
 (e) This Section 4 of this Article III may be amended or repealed only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty-five (85 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the corporation provided, however, that no amendment or repeal adopted after the Shareholder Notice under subsection (c) hereof shall affect any such shares thereafter deposited with the Redemption Agent in connection with such Shareholder Notice for redemption pursuant to this Section 4.

 A director shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the books of account of the corporation or statements prepared by any of its officials as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities and or net profits of the corporation, or any other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of surplus or other funds from which dividends might properly be declared and paid. 
 
 Without action by the stockholders, the shares of stock may be issued by the corporation from time to time for such consideration (not less than the par value thereof if such stock has a par value) as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors thereof, and any and all such shares so issued, the full consideration for which has been paid or delivered, shall be deemed fully paid stock and not liable to any further call or assessment thereon, and the holder of such shares shall not be liable for any further call or assessment thereon, or for any other payment thereon. 
 
 6. Shareholder Voting Requirements, Fairness of Certain Proposed Business Combinations. 
 
 (a) Except as expressly provided in Section 6(b) hereof, no Business Combination shall be consummated without first being approved by the affirmative vote of 95 of the then outstanding Voting Stock voting together as a single class. The affirmative vote required by this Section 6(a) is in addition to any other affirmative vote required by law, these Restated Articles of Incorporation, the By-Laws of the corporation or otherwise. 
 
 (b) Section 6(a) hereof shall not apply to a Business Combination if all of the conditions precedent specified in either Section 6(b)(1) or Section 6(b)(2) are met prior to the consummation of such Business Combination. 
 
 (1) The Business Combination shall have been duly approved by a majority of all of the Continuing Directors. 
 
 (2) All of conditions 6(b)(2)(i) through 6(b)(2)(v) shall have been met.

 (A) the highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers fees) paid by the Interested Shareholder for any share of such Voting Stock acquired by it (X) within the two-year period immediately prior to the first public announcement of the proposed Business Combination (the Announcement Date or (Y) in the transaction in which the Interested Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder, whichever is higher 
 
 (B) the Fair Market Value per share of such Voting Stock on the Announcement Date or on the date on which the Interested Shareholder became 
 5 

an Interested Shareholder (such latter date is referred to in this Section 6 as the Determination Date ), whichever is higher, multiplied by the greater of one (1.0) or the ratio of (X) the highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers fees) paid by the Interested Shareholder for any shares of such Voting Stock acquired by it within the two-year period immediately prior to the Announcement Date or in the transaction in which the Interested Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder, whichever is higher, to (Y) the Fair Market Value per share of such Voting Stock on the first date in such two-year period immediately prior to the Announcement Date on which the Interested Shareholder acquired any such Voting Stock, or, in the event the Interested Shareholder did not acquire any such Voting Stock within such two-year period, the Fair Market Value per share of such Voting Stock on the most recent date on which the Interested Shareholder acquired any such Voting Stock and 
 
 (C) the primary earnings per share of the Common Stock for the four full consecutive fiscal quarters of the corporation immediately preceding the Announcement Date multiplied by the price earnings ratio of the Interested Shareholder.

The Fair Market Value of non-cash consideration shall be determined as of the date of the consummation of the Business Combination. 
 
 (ii) The consideration to be received by holders of a particular class of outstanding Voting Stock pursuant to the proposed Business Combination shall be cash unless the Interested Shareholder acquired all Voting Stock beneficially owned by such Interested Shareholder for non-cash consideration. In such case, the consideration to be paid in the proposed Business Combination shall be in the same form previously paid by the Interested Shareholder for such Voting Stock. 
 
 (iii) After such Interested Shareholder has become an Interested Shareholder and prior to the consummation of such Business Combination 
 
 (A) there shall have been no failure to declare and pay at the regular date therefor any dividends (whether or not cumulative) on any outstanding preferred stock of the corporation, except as approved by a majority of all of the Continuing Directors 
 
 (B) there shall have been no reduction in the rate or frequency of dividends paid on any class of common stock of the corporation as compared to the practice of the corporation immediately preceding the Determination Date (except as necessary to reflect any subdivision of any class of such common stock or to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions of any applicable law) or except as approved by a majority of all of the Continuing Directors

 6 

the corporation, unless the failure to increase such annual rate is approved by a majority of all of the Continuing Directors and 
 
 (D) such Interested Shareholder shall not have become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of Voting Stock except to the extent necessary to fulfill contractual obligations incurred in the transaction which resulted in such Interested Shareholder becoming an Interested Shareholder so long as the terms of such transaction are not amended or modified subsequent to the Determination Date. 
 
 (iv) After the Determination Date, the Interested Shareholder shall not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance, or any tax credits or other tax advantages provided by the corporation, whether in anticipation of such Business Combination or otherwise. 
 
 (v) A proxy or information statement describing the proposed Business Combination containing the views of all of the Continuing Directors and any investment advisor selected by a majority of all of the Continuing Directors and complying with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder (or any subsequent provisions replacing such Act, rules or regulations) shall be mailed to shareholders of the corporation at least 30 days prior to the consummation of such Business Combination (whether or not such proxy or information statement is required to be mailed pursuant to such Act or subsequent provisions).

The number of shares calculated in accordance with the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall be deemed not to include (and to the extent any of the following arrangements have been entered into by affiliates of the shareholder (or of any Constituent Holder), shall be reduced by) any shares (x) sold by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either s affiliates) in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (y) borrowed by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either s affiliates) for any purposes or purchased by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either s affiliates) pursuant to an agreement to resell, or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either s affiliates), whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares, cash or other consideration, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, or if exercised by either party thereto would have, the purpose or effect of (i) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such shareholder s or Constituent Holder s (or either s affiliate s) full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and or (ii) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or either s affiliate). A shareholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall be deemed to own shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the shareholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of Directors and the right to direct the disposition thereof and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. For purposes of this Section 2.2(e), a shareholder s (including any Constituent Holder s) ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the shareholder has loaned such shares so long as such shareholder retains the power to recall such shares on no greater than five business days notice or has delegated any voting power over such shares by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other 
 12 

instrument or arrangement so long as such delegation is revocable at any time by the shareholder. 
 (2) For purposes of this Section 2.2(e), the Required Information that the Corporation will include in its proxy statement is (i) the information concerning the Shareholder Nominee and the Eligible Shareholder that the Corporation determines is required to be disclosed in the Corporation s proxy statement by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) if the Eligible Shareholder so elects, a Statement (as defined below). The Corporation shall also include the name of the Shareholder Nominee in its proxy card. Any other provision of these Bylaws notwithstanding, the Corporation may in its sole discretion solicit against, and include in the proxy statement its own statement(s) or other information relating to, any Eligible Shareholder and or Shareholder Nominee, including any information provided to the Corporation with respect to the foregoing. 
 (3) To be timely, a shareholder s Proxy Access Notice must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation within the time periods applicable to shareholder notices of nominations pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Neither an adjournment nor a postponement of an annual meeting (or an announcement thereof) shall begin a new time period for delivering a Proxy Access Notice. 
 (4) The maximum number of Shareholder Nominees (including Shareholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Shareholder for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 2.2(e) but are either subsequently withdrawn or that the Board of Directors decides to nominate as Board of Directors nominees or otherwise appoint to the Board) appearing in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 2.2(e) with respect to an annual meeting of shareholders shall not exceed the greater of (x) two Directors or (y) the largest whole number that does not exceed 20 of the number of Directors in office as of the last day on which a Proxy Access Notice may be delivered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2(e) (such greater number, the Permitted Number provided, however, that the Permitted Number shall be reduced by 
 (i) the number of Directors in office or director candidates for whom access to the Corporation s proxy materials was previously provided (or requested) pursuant to this Section 2.2(e), other than (a) any such director referred to in this clause (i) whose term of office will expire at such annual meeting and who is not seeking (or agreeing) to be nominated at such meeting for another term of office and (b) any such director who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously as a nominee of the Board of Directors for at least two successive annual terms 
 13 

(ii) the number of such director candidates for which the Corporation shall have received one or more shareholder notices nominating director candidates pursuant to Section 2.2(b) and 
 (iii) the number of Directors in office or director candidates that in either case were elected or appointed to the Board of Directors or will be included in the Corporation s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting as an unopposed (by the Corporation) nominee, pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or other understanding with a shareholder or group of shareholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of Voting Stock, by such shareholder or group of shareholders, from the Corporation), other than any such director referred to in this clause (iii) whose term of office will expire at such annual meeting and who is not seeking (or agreeing) to be nominated at such meeting for another term of office provided that this clause (iii) shall only apply to the annual meeting which follows such agreement, arrangement or understanding 
 provided, further, in the event the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors effective on or prior to the date of the annual meeting, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of Directors in office as so reduced. An Eligible Shareholder submitting more than one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy statement pursuant to this Section 2.2(e) shall rank such Shareholder Nominees based on the order that the Eligible Shareholder desires such Shareholder Nominees to be selected for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy statement and include such specified rank in its Proxy Access Notice. If the number of Shareholder Nominees pursuant to this Section 2.2(e) for an annual meeting of shareholders exceeds the Permitted Number, then the highest ranking qualifying Shareholder Nominee from each Eligible Shareholder will be selected by the Corporation for inclusion in the proxy statement until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of the ownership position as disclosed in each Eligible Shareholder s Proxy Access Notice. If the Permitted Number is not reached after the highest ranking Shareholder Nominee from each Eligible Shareholder has been selected, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached. 
 (5) An Eligible Shareholder is one or more shareholders of record who own and have owned, or are acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who own and have owned (in each case as defined above), in each case continuously for at least three years as of both the date that the Proxy Access Notice is received by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 2.2(e), and as of the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice and to vote at the annual meeting, at least three percent of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock (the Proxy Access Request Required Shares ), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required Shares at all times between the date such Proxy Access Notice is received by the Corporation and the date of the 
 14 

applicable annual meeting, provided that the aggregate number of shareholders, and, if and to the extent that a shareholder is acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners, of such beneficial owners, whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed 20. Two or more investment funds that are part of same family of funds by virtue of being under common management and investment control, under common management and sponsored primarily by the same employer or a group of investment companies (as such term is defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) (a Qualifying Fund shall be treated as one shareholder for the purpose of determining the aggregate number of shareholders in this subsection (5), provided that each fund included within a Qualifying Fund otherwise meets the requirements set forth in this Section 2.2(e). No shares may be attributed to more than one group constituting an Eligible Shareholder under this Section 2.2(e), and no shareholder may be a member of more than one group constituting an Eligible Shareholder. A record holder acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners will not be counted separately as a shareholder with respect to the shares owned by beneficial owners on whose behalf such record holder has been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this subsection (5), for purposes of determining the number of shareholders whose holdings may be considered as part of an Eligible Shareholder s holdings. Proxy Access Request Required Shares will qualify as such if and only if the beneficial owner of such shares as of the date of the Proxy Access Notice has itself individually beneficially owned such shares continuously for the three-year period ending on that date and through the other applicable dates referred to above (in addition to the other applicable requirements being met). 
 (6) No later than the final date when a Proxy Access Notice pursuant to this Section 2.2(e) may be timely delivered to the Secretary, an Eligible Shareholder (including each Constituent Holder) must provide the information required by Section 2.2(b)(3) of this Article II to the Secretary of the Corporation and also provide the following information in writing to the Secretary

 (ii) one or more written statements from the record holder of the shares (and from each intermediary through which the shares are or have been held during the requisite three-year holding period) verifying that, as of a date within seven calendar days prior to the date the Proxy Access Notice is delivered to the Corporation, such person owns, and has owned continuously for the preceding three years, the Proxy Access Request Required Shares, and such person s agreement to provide 
 15 

(a) within 10 days after the record date for the annual meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries verifying such person s continuous ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the record date, together with any additional information reasonably requested to verify such person s ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares and

 16 

members of one group member that is authorized to act on behalf of all members of the nominating shareholder group with respect to the nomination and matters related thereto, including withdrawal of the nomination and 
 (v) an undertaking that such person agrees to 
 (a) assume all liability stemming from, and indemnify and hold harmless the Corporation and its affiliates and each of its and their directors, officers, and employees individually against any liability, loss or damages in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, whether legal, administrative or investigative, against the Corporation or its affiliates or any of its or their directors, officers or employees arising out of any legal or regulatory violation arising out of the Eligible Shareholder s communications with the shareholders of the Corporation or out of the information that the Eligible Shareholder provided to the Corporation in connection with the nomination of the Shareholder Nominee(s) or its efforts to elect such person(s) to the Board 
 (b) promptly provide to the Corporation such other information as the Corporation may reasonably request and

 17

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.2(e), the Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement that it, in good faith, believes is materially false or misleading, omits to state any material fact, directly or indirectly without factual foundation impugns the character, integrity or personal reputation of or makes charges concerning improper, illegal or immoral conduct or associations with respect to any person or would violate any applicable law or regulation.

 Any proposed Shareholder Nominee shall also furnish any information, in addition to that required above, to the Corporation as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as an independent Director or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee. 
 (9) Any Shareholder Nominee who is included in the Corporation s proxy statement for a particular annual meeting of shareholders, but subsequently is determined not to satisfy the eligibility requirements of this Section 2.2(e) or any other provision of these Bylaws, the Restated Articles of Incorporation or other applicable regulation any time before the annual meeting of shareholders, will not be eligible for election at the relevant annual meeting of shareholders.

In the case of uncertificated shares, transfer shall be made only upon receipt of transfer documentation reasonably acceptable to the Corporation. 
 Section 4.4 Registered Owner . The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive rights of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of the State of Missouri.

The Board of Directors shall have the power to close the transfer books of the Corporation for a period not exceeding 70 days prior to the date of any meeting of shareholders, or the date for payment of any dividend, or the date for all allotment of rights, or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of shares shall go into effect. In lieu of so closing the transfer books, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or any allotment of rights, or entitled to exercise the rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of shares, up to 70 days prior to the date of any meeting of shareholders, or the date for the payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of shares shall go into effect. In such case only the shareholders who are shareholders of record on the date of closing the share transfer books, or on the record date so fixed, shall be entitled to receive notice of and to vote at such meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof, or to receive payment of such dividend, or to receive such allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after the date of closing of the transfer books or the record date. If the Board of Directors does not close the transfer books or set a record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting of shareholders, only the shareholders who are shareholders of record at the close of business on the 20th day preceding the date of the meeting shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting and upon any adjournment or postponement of the meetings, except that if prior to the meeting written waivers of notice of the meeting are signed and delivered to the Corporation by all of the shareholders of record at the time the meeting is convened, only the shareholders who are shareholders of record at the time the meeting is convened shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. 
 ARTICLE 5. INDEMNIFICATION 
 Section 5.1 Right of Directors and Officers to Indemnification . Each person who was or is a Director or officer of the Corporation shall be indemnified by the Corporation as a matter of right to the fullest extent permitted or authorized by applicable law and as otherwise provided in Article VIII of the Corporation s Restated Articles of Incorporation. 
 The indemnification described in the preceding paragraph of this Article 5 shall pertain to all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person who was or is a party to or who was or is involved in any proceeding by reason of acts or omissions 
 (a) in such person s capacity as or arising out of such person s status as (i) a Director or officer of the Corporation or (ii) a Director, officer, employee or agent of another 
 25 

Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise when so serving at the request of the Corporation or 
 (b) in any other capacity while holding the office of either Director or officer of the Corporation. 
 Section 5.2 Indemnification of Employees, Agents, Etc. Each person who was or is an employee or agent of the Corporation, or who was or is serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including the heirs, executors, administrators or estate of each such person) may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, be indemnified by the Corporation to the same extent as provided herein with respect to any person who was or is a Director or officer of the Corporation. 
 Section 5.3 Right of Directors and Officers to Advance of Expenses . Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by any person who was or is a Director or officer of the Corporation in defending any proceeding (including those by or in the right of the Corporation) shall be promptly advanced by the Corporation when so requested by such person at any time and from time to time, but only if the requesting person delivers to the Corporation an undertaking to repay to the Corporation all amounts so advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the requesting person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under the indemnification sources as defined below, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise. 
 Section 5.4 Right of Claimant to Bring Suit . If a claim for indemnification under Section 5.1 or 5.3, respectively, is not paid in full by the Corporation within 90 or 15 days, respectively, after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If the claimant is successful in whole or in part in such suit, the claimant shall also be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. 
 It shall be a defense to any suit seeking indemnification under Section 5.1 of these Bylaws that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible (under indemnification sources, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise) for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant. The failure of the Corporation (through its Directors, independent legal counsel or shareholders) to make a determination before the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances (because the claimant has met the applicable standard of conduct) shall not be a defense to the claimant s action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. Similarly, an actual determination by the Corporation that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall not be a defense to the claimant s action nor create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 
 Section 5.5 Definitions . In this Article the following terms have the following meanings 
 26 

(a) The term applicable law means (i) Section 351.355 of The Missouri General and Business Corporation Law (other than Subsection 6 thereof and any other Subsection comparable in purpose to Subsection 6) as in effect on May 7, 1986 and as thereafter amended (but in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than The Missouri General and Business Corporation Law permitted the Corporation to provide immediately prior to such amendment) and (ii) any other statutory indemnification provisions adopted after May 7, 1986. 
 (b) The term Directors or officers of the Corporation shall include the heirs, executors, administrators and estate of each such person who was a Director or officer, which heirs, executors, administrators and estate shall succeed to all of the indemnification and other rights of such Director or officer. 
 (c) The term proceedings shall mean any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or other proceeding (including those by or in the right of the Corporation) whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative. 
 (d) The term fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan. 
 (e) The term indemnification sources shall refer jointly and severally to applicable law as defined above, this Article 5 and Article VIII of the Corporation s Restated Articles of Incorporation. 
 (f) The term other enterprise shall include employee benefit plans. 
 (g) The term serving at the request of the Corporation shall include any service as a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such Director, officer, employee or agent with respect to any employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries. 
 Section 5.6 Rights Not Exclusive . The indemnification and other rights provided by this Article and the other indemnification sources shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a Director or officer may be entitled under any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person s official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding the office of Director or officer, and the Corporation may, at its discretion, provide such indemnification and other rights by any agreements, vote of shareholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise. 
 Section 5.7 Insurance . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who was or is a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or was or is serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against or incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against 
 27 

such liability under these Bylaws, other indemnification sources, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise. 
 Section 5.8 Enforceability Amendment . Each person who was or is a Director or officer of the Corporation is a third party beneficiary of this Article 5 and shall be entitled to enforce against the Corporation all indemnification and other rights provided or contemplated by this Article 5. 
 This Article 5 may be hereafter amended or repealed provided, however, no such amendment or repeal shall reduce, terminate or otherwise adversely affect the right of any person who was or is a Director or officer (i) to obtain indemnification or an advance of expenses with respect to a proceeding that pertains to or arises out of actions or omissions that occurred prior to the Deadline Indemnification Date as defined in the next paragraph of this Section, or (ii) to bring suit with respect to the foregoing under Section 5.4 hereof. 
 The term Deadline Indemnification Date means the later of (a) the effective date of any amendment or repeal of this Article 5 which reduces, terminates or otherwise adversely affects the rights hereunder of any person who was or is a Director or officer (b) the expiration date of such person s then current term of office with, or service for, the Corporation (provided such person has a stated term of office or service and completes such term) or (c) the effective date such person resigns his or her office or terminates his or her service (provided such person has a stated term of office or service but resigns prior to the expiration of such term).

No such shareholder, however, may remove any such books and records from such premises, and no such shareholder shall make alterations to such books or records, and in each instance of examination by such 
 28 

shareholder of such books or records, an officer or employee designated by an officer of the Corporation shall be present at all times during such examination, and the regular wage or salary of such officer or employee for the period of time spent in such examination shall be paid to the Corporation by such shareholder or shareholders making such examination. Notwithstanding any provision hereinabove to the contrary, no shareholder shall have the right to examine the books or the records of the Corporation if any officer of the Corporation determines, in his or her discretion, that such examination may be to the detriment or competitive disadvantage of the Corporation or if the purpose of such examination is improper. 
 Section 6.6 Amendments . These Bylaws may be altered, amended, or repealed, to the extent not prohibited by law or the Restated Articles of Incorporation, by the Board of Directors. 
 Section 6.7 Provisions Additional to Provisions of Law . All restrictions, limitations, requirements and other provisions of these Bylaws shall be construed, insofar as possible, as supplemental and additional to all provisions of law applicable to the subject matter thereof and shall be fully complied with in addition to the said provisions of law unless such compliance shall be illegal. 
 Section 6.8 Provisions Contrary to Provisions of Law . Any portion of these Bylaws which, upon being construed in the manner provided in Section 6.7 hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable provisions of law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law remain in effect, but such result shall not affect the validity or applicability of any other portion of these Bylaws, it being hereby declared that these Bylaws and each portion thereof would have been adopted, irrespective of the fact that any portion is illegal.
