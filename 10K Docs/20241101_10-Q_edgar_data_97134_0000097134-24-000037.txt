 Contract Liabilities 
 Sales Returns 
 The right of return may exist explicitly or implicitly with our customers. When the right of return exists, we adjust the transaction price for the estimated effect of returns. We estimate the expected returns using the expected value method by assessing historical sales levels and the timing and magnitude of historical sales return levels as a percent of sales and projecting this experience into the future. 
 Sales Incentives 
 Our sales contracts may contain various customer incentives, such as volume-based rebates or other promotions. We reduce the transaction price for certain customer programs and incentive offerings that represent variable consideration. Sales incentives given to our customers are recorded using the most likely amount approach for estimating the amount of consideration to which the Company will be entitled. We forecast the most likely amount of the incentive to be paid at the time of sale, update this forecast quarterly, and adjust the transaction price accordingly to reflect the new amount of incentives expected to be earned by the customer. A majority of our customer incentives are settled within one year. We record our accruals for volume-based rebates and other promotions in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

Borrowings may be denominated in U.S. dollars or certain other currencies. 
 On November 10, 2022, we amended the 2021 Credit Agreement (the "Amendment") to update the benchmark provisions to replace LIBOR with Term SOFR (as defined in the Amendment) as the reference rate for purposes of calculating interest under the 2021 Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (a) the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Amendment) plus a credit spread adjustment of per annum, but in any case, not less than , plus an additional spread of to , depending on our leverage ratio, or (b) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Amendment), which is the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus and

 , plus, in any such case, , plus an additional spread of to , depending on our leverage ratio. All other material terms included in the 2021 Credit Agreement remain unchanged as a result of the Amendment. 
 On August 7, 2024, we and certain of our foreign subsidiaries entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "2024 Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, which amends and restates the 2021 Credit Agreement as amended by the Amendment. The 2024 Credit Agreement provides us and certain of our foreign subsidiaries access to a senior secured credit facility until August 7, 2029, consisting of a revolving facility in an amount up to million, with an option to expand the revolving facility or obtain incremental term loans by up to million, with the consent of the lenders willing to provide additional borrowings in the form of increases to their revolving facility commitment or funding of incremental term loans. Borrowings may be denominated in U.S. dollars or certain other currencies. 
 The fee for undrawn committed funds under the revolving facility of the 2024 Credit Agreement ranges from an annual rate of to , depending on our leverage ratio. Borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars under the 2024 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (a) the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the NYFRB Rate (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) plus and (iii) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) for a one month period plus ; but in any case not less than , plus an additional spread of to , depending on our leverage ratio, (b) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus an additional spread of to , depending on our leverage ratio, or (c) the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) plus an additional spread of to , depending on our leverage ratio. 
 In connection with the 2024 Credit Agreement, we reaffirmed our security interest in favor of the lenders in substantially all its personal property and pledged the stock of certain of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries. The obligations under the 2024 Credit Agreement are also guaranteed by certain of the Company s subsidiaries and those subsidiaries also provided a security interest in their similar personal property. 
 The 2024 Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting the Company s ability to incur indebtedness and liens and merge or consolidate with another entity. Further, the 2024 Credit Agreement contains the following covenants: 
 a covenant requiring us to maintain an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio, determined as of the end of each of its fiscal quarters, of no greater than to 1.00, with certain alternative requirements for permitted acquisitions of at least million; 
 a covenant requiring us to maintain an EBITDA to interest expense ratio for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters as of the end of each quarter of no less than to 1; and 
 a covenant restricting us from paying dividends or repurchasing stock if, after giving effect to such payments and assuming no default exists or would result from such payment, our leverage ratio is greater than to 1, in such case limiting such payments to the greater of 10 of consolidated total assets and million during any fiscal year. 
 We are in compliance with the covenants as of September 30, 2024.

 Cash Flow Hedges 
 We manage our floating rate debt exposure using interest rate swaps. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of the possibility of increased interest costs. We entered into an aggregate million notional amount of interest rate swaps effective December 1, 2022, that exchange a variable rate of interest for a fixed rate of interest of . These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. These swaps are scheduled to mature on December 1, 2026. 
 Fair Value Hedges 
 On April 5, 2022, we entered into Euro to U.S. dollar foreign exchange cross-currency swaps associated with an intercompany loan from a wholly owned European subsidiary. We enter into these foreign exchange cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with this intercompany loan, and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. These cross-currency swaps are designated as fair value hedges. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these cross-currency swaps included million of total notional value. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregated scheduled interest payments over the course of the loan and related swaps amounted to million. The scheduled maturity and principal payment of the loan of million is due in April 2027. 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 On April 5, 2022, we entered into Euro to U.S. dollar foreign exchange cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposure to adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements between Tennant Company and a wholly owned European subsidiary. We enter into these fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap agreements to protect a designated monetary amount of the Company s net investment in its Euro functional currency subsidiary against the risk of changes in the Euro to U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate. These cross-currency swaps are designated as net investment hedges. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cross-currency swaps included million of total notional value. These swaps are scheduled to mature in April 2027.

In addition to the liability of million for unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024, there was approximately million for accrued interest and penalties. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate as of September 30, 2024 was million. To the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be revised and reflected as an adjustment of the income tax expense.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) provides a comparison of the Company's results of operations, as well as liquidity and capital resources for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The MD A should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Throughout this MD A, the Company refers to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S. Net sales excluding foreign currency translation (i.e., organic sales) is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP; however, the Company believes it is useful in understanding its financial results and provides comparable measures for understanding the operating results of the Company between different periods. 
 
 Overview 
 Tennant Company is a world leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing solutions that help create a cleaner, safer, healthier world. The Company is committed to creating and commercializing breakthrough, sustainable cleaning innovations to enhance its broad suite of products, including floor maintenance and cleaning equipment, detergent-free and other sustainable cleaning technologies, aftermarket parts and consumables, equipment maintenance and repair service, and asset management solutions. Our products are used in many types of environments, including retail establishments, distribution centers, factories and warehouses, public venues such as arenas and stadiums, office buildings, schools and universities, hospitals and clinics, and more. Customers include contract cleaners to whom organizations outsource facilities maintenance as well as businesses that perform facilities maintenance themselves. The Company reaches these customers through the industry's largest direct sales and service organization and through a strong and well-supported network of authorized distributors worldwide. 
 
 Macroeconomic Events 
 Recent macroeconomic events including inflation, slower economic growth, and political unrest have led to economic uncertainty and volatility globally. Our business is influenced by customer spending and global demand for our products. We are closely monitoring a weaker-than-expected economic environment in our EMEA region and are facing challenging business conditions in APAC, especially in China, where excess manufacturing capacity and government-induced overproduction are resulting in increased pricing pressure. 
 The global nature of our operations subjects us to exposures resulting from both foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business and geopolitical risks stemming from global conflicts. While we do not have any direct operations or employees in areas experiencing conflicts, our operating results have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures from these conflicts. 
 As described in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors in the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we may encounter financial difficulties if the U.S. or other global economies experience an additional or continued long-term economic downturn as our product sales are sensitive to declines in capital spending by our customers. Any sustained adverse impacts to our business, the industries in which we operate, market demand for our products, and/or certain suppliers or customers may also affect our future results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We are actively monitoring the global macroeconomic environment, including geopolitical conflict, the potential impact of global supply chain constraints on material inflation, and change in demand for our products. 
 
 Outlook 
 Despite the challenging economic environment, particularly in EMEA and APAC, we remain confident in the long-term overall health of our business and the strength of our products and services across the markets we serve.

 Net Sales 
 Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 315.8 million, a 3.6 increase as compared to consolidated net sales of 304.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The components of the consolidated net sales change were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Price 1.8 3.1 Volume 0.9 (1.0) Organic growth 2.7 2.1 Acquisitions 1.3 0.8 Foreign currency (0.4) (0.2) Total growth 3.6 2.7 
 The 3.6 increase in consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was driven by: 
 
 Organic sales growth of 2.7 was primarily due to price realization and higher equipment sales in the Americas, partly offset by lower organic sales in the EMEA and APAC regions; 
 Inorganic growth of 1.3 driven by the acquisition of TCS; partly offset by 
 A net unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 0.4 . 
 
 The 2.7 increase in consolidated net sales in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was driven by:

Table of Contents 

 Organic sales growth of 2.1 attributed to price realization across all regions and favorable product and channel mix and higher equipment sales in the Americas, partly offset by lower organic sales in the EMEA and APAC regions; 
 Inorganic growth of 0.8 driven by the acquisition of TCS; partly offset by 
 A net unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange across all regions of approximately 0.2 . 
 The following table sets forth the net sales by geographic area for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions, except percentages): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Americas 218.7 211.2 3.6 662.1 632.2 4.7 Europe, Middle East and Africa 76.3 72.0 6.0 234.6 234.1 0.2 Asia Pacific 20.8 21.5 (3.3) 61.1 65.9 (7.3) Total 315.8 304.7 3.6 957.8 932.2 2.7 
 Americas 
 Americas net sales were 218.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 3.6 from the third quarter of 2023 driven by: 
 Organic sales growth of 4.6 was driven by higher equipment sales and strong price realization; and 
 A net unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 1.0 . 
 Americas net sales were 662.1 million for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 4.7 from the first nine months of 2023 driven by: 
 
 Organic sales growth of 5.0 driven by strong price realization and higher equipment sales, including favorable product and channel mix in North America, partly offset by unit volume declines in North America commercial equipment; and 
 A net unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 0.3 . 
 Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") 
 EMEA net sales were 76.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 6.0 from the third quarter of 2023 driven by: 
 Inorganic sales increase of 5.8 due to the acquisition of TCS; 
 A net favorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 1.0 ; partly offset by 
 Organic sales decrease of 0.8 driven by volume declines in both equipment and parts and consumables, partly offset by price realization. 
 EMEA net sales were 234.6 million for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 0.2 from the first nine months of 2023 driven by: 
 
 Inorganic sales increase of 3.3 due to the acquisition of TCS; 
 A net favorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 0.5 ; partly offset by 
 Organic sales decrease of 3.6 driven by volume declines in both equipment and parts and consumables, partly offset by price realization. 
 Asia Pacific ("APAC") 
 APAC net sales were 20.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 3.3 from the third quarter of 2023 driven by: 
 Organic sales decrease of 4.3 driven by volume declines in China and Australia, partly offset by price realization in Australia; and 
 A net favorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 1.0 .

Table of Contents 

APAC net sales were 61.1 million for the first nine months of 2024, a decrease of 7.3 from the first nine months of 2023 driven by: 
 
 Organic sales decrease of 6.2 attributed to volume declines in China, partly offset by price realization in Australia; and 
 A net unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 1.1 . 
 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit margin of 42.4 was 90 basis points lower in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The margin rate decrease is primarily attributed to higher inflationary pressure on materials as well as elevated freight costs, partly offset by price realization. Gross profit margin of 43.2 was 60 basis points higher in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. The margin rate increase was driven by price realization and cost saving initiatives, which more than offset the effects of inflation. Strong margin rates are also supported by favorable product mix, including higher industrial equipment sales. 
 
 Operating Expense 
 Selling and Administrative Expense 
 Selling and administrative expense ("S A expense") was 92.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 4.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of net sales, S A expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 50 basis points to 29.4 from 28.9 in the third quarter of 2023. S A expense was 275.5 million for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 18.6 million compared to the first nine months of 2023. S A expense as a percentage of net sales for the first nine months of 2024 increased 120 basis points to 28.8 from 27.6 in the first nine months of 2023. The S A expense increase in both periods was driven by higher costs linked to our strategic investments and higher compensation and benefits expense related to incremental resources to support the Company's enterprise growth strategy, partly offset by lower bad debt expense, lower legal fees, and a decrease in warranty claims. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expense ("R D expense") was 10.5 million, or 3.3 of net sales, for the third quarter of 2024, with R D expense as a percentage of net sales increasing 30 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023. R D expense was 31.8 million, or 3.3 of net sales, for the first nine months of 2024, increasing 50 basis points compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 We continue to invest in developing innovative products and technologies at levels necessary to propel our technology and innovative leadership position. 
 
 Total Other Expense, Net 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net was 2.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.3 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was the result of lower weighted average outstanding borrowings. The following table compares the debt levels, average interest rate, interest income and interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively (in millions, except percentages):

Table of Contents 

 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Weighted Average Outstanding Borrowings 213.6 262.4 213.9 291.3 Average interest rate 6.54 6.48 6.51 6.19 Interest expense 3.6 4.3 10.4 13.5 Interest income (0.9) (1.0) (2.9) (2.5) Interest expense, net 2.7 3.3 7.5 11.0 
 Our debt portfolio as of September 30, 2024 was comprised of debt predominately in U.S. dollars. The Company manages its floating rate debt exposure using fixed rate interest rate swaps to reduce the Company's risk of the possibility of increased interest costs. The Company has an aggregate 120.0 million notional amount of interest rate swaps that exchange a variable rate of interest for a fixed rate of interest of 4.076 over the term of the agreements. 
 Net Foreign Currency Transaction Gain (Loss) 
 Net foreign currency transaction loss was 0.4 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. The unfavorable impact was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Chinese renminbi and Mexican peso. Net currency transaction gain was 0.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to a gain of 0.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. The favorable impact was primarily due to hedging gains on foreign denominated receivables. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 24.4 compared to 23.4 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in nondeductible executive compensation and unfavorable changes in the mix in forecasted earnings by country. 
 The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 22.5 compared to 22.9 for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in discrete tax benefits associated with share-based compensation partly offset by an increase in nondeductible executive compensation. 
 In general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is zero or immaterial. No deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of our foreign investments to the U.S. 
 
 Backlog 
 Backlog is one of the many indicators of business conditions in the Company's markets. Our order backlog was 76.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 186.2 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was the result of the Company's ability to obtain key component parts and drive strong production levels. Backlog includes orders that can be cancelled or postponed at the option of the customer at any time without penalty. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 91.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 117.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Wherever possible, cash management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to provide working capital to subsidiaries as needed. Our current ratio was 2.2 as of September 30, 2024 and 2.1 as of December 31, 2023. Our primary working capital, which is comprised of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payables, was 334.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and 312.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 24.4 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 25.8 as of December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of 3.2 million, leaving approximately 439.3 million of unused borrowing capacity on our revolving facility. 
 Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 52.2 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 124.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was the result of consumption of working capital and spend on our ERP modernization project of 25.6 million. 
 
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 69.1 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 15.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash outflows was primarily driven by cash used for the investment in Brain Corp of 32.1 million and cash used, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of TCS of 25.7 million. 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.1 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 87.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash outflows was primarily driven by proceeds from exercises of stock options and net proceeds from borrowings, partly offset by share repurchases and dividend payments. 
 
 Newly Issued Accounting Guidance 
 See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting pronouncements. 
 In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06 Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC's Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative, which aims to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements on a variety of topics and align the requirements in the FASB accounting standard with the Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. This guidance is effective for the Company no later than June 30, 2027. We do not expect the amendments in this update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires an entity to disclose significant segment expenses impacting profit and loss that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. The amendments in this ASU are required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our financial disclosures. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures.

The amendments in this ASU are required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis although retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our financial disclosures. 
 No other new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective have had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.
