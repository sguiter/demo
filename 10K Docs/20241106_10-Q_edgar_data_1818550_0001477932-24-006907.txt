NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (Unaudited) as of September 30, 2024. The Company currently has losses and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

F-8 Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COMPANY We were incorporated in Nevada on June 12, 2020. We are a development stage company that was formed to offer handwritten letter service via our website platform. We plan to develop and sell Customer Relationship Management (CRM) program designed to assist businesses in sending handwritten letters to their customers. Also, we are planning to develop Reporting and Analytics Software analytics to help our customers see how effective these handwritten letters are in their marketing campaigns. Our principal executive offices are located at 6 Rosemary Way, Nuneaton, United Kingdom CV10 7ST. Our phone number is +1 702 879 4409. From inception until the date of this filing, we have had very limited operating activities. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Incordex Corp. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our President, Iurii Abramovici, will offer shares of our common stock to his friends, family members and business associates in United Kingdom and Europe. Great Importance A hand addressed envelope and handwritten letter suggests the sender is somebody the recipient knows. That creates an aura of great importance for the piece. Personalization A handwritten address and letter in beautiful ink creates a much more personal impression than the pre-printed variety. When people feel a personal connection to a mailing, it s hard to resist the urge to open it. Contact While digital communications continue to leave a big footprint in the marketing world, people by and large still respond more readily to something they can touch. Paper communications offer touchable, real experiences that satisfy this basic need for touch. A personalized hand addressed envelope makes this experience even more real. Feeling of Comfort Because hand addressed direct mail offers a personalized connection, recipients feel much more comfortable and far less on their guard when it comes time to decide open it or trash it. Our Web Site Customers will be able to choose personal handwritten letter service or business services on the website. Private customers will have to fill up simple forms on our web site. Forms will include information about customer name and address, recipient name and address, text and payment information. Business customers will have to fill out quote form via our website. Our site will have special forms for freelancers wishing to work with us. We are currently on the software development stage. Also, we plan to launch two websites: one to offer CRM software development and maintenance, which assists businesses in sending handwritten letters to their customers. The second website will be dedicated to the development of Reporting and Analytics Software, enabling businesses to assess the effectiveness of these handwritten letters in their marketing campaigns. On September 28, 2023, the Company, entered into Website Development Agreement with Alex White Developer ). 5 Table of Contents Revenue For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have generated 1,805 and 4,700 as revenue, respectively. We have launched our web site at: https://incordexcorp.com/. The Company plans to generate revenue via direct sales and via online orders. Competition The market for direct marketing is highly competitive. Numerous online services will compete with us. Our competitors are substantially larger and more experienced than us and have longer operating histories and have materially greater financial and other resources than us. Marketing We plan to focus on direct sales online as we get started. Once we build a reputation and customer base, it will be easier to attract customers. We plan to market our products mainly in Europe and US. To promote our website and services, we are planning to use On-line Directories and Databases and Social Media. Employees and Employment Agreements At present, we have no employees other than our officer and director. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees. RESULTS OF OPERATION Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. Three Months Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: During the three months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we have generated 1,805 and 4,700 in revenues, respectively. For the three months period ended September 30, 2024 operating expenses were (9,207). Operating expenses consist of mainly professional fees. For the three months period ended September 30, 2023 operating expenses were (4,604). Operating expenses consist of mainly professional fees. Expenses increased due to the Company s operational activities. The total other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 12,500 and 0, respectively. Our net income for the three months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 5,098 and 96, respectively. 6 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of September 30, 2024, our total assets were 21,777 primarily consisting of cash 2,228) and intangible assets 19,549). As of September 30, 2024, our total liabilities were 26,395 consisting of director loan 24,014) and accounts payable 2,381). Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities was (3,762). For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in operating activities was (2,888). Cash Flows from Investing Activities We have not generated cash flows from investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows provided by financing activities was 5,000 from director loan. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows provided by financing activities was 4,000 from director loan. Plan of Operation and Funding We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing. 7 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Going Concern The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. No report required. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
