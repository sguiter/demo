 (a) Included in the other current assets line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 (b) Included in the accrued liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 For the three and six months ended September 2024, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of revenue that was included in the contract liability balance during the periods, including amounts recorded as a contract liability and subsequently recognized as revenue as performance obligations were satisfied within the same period, such as order deposits from customers. The change in the contract asset and contract liability balances primarily results from the timing differences between the Company's satisfaction of performance obligations and the customer's payment. 
 Performance Obligations 
 As of September 2024, the Company expects to recognize million of fixed consideration related to the future minimum guarantees in effect under its licensing agreements and expects 

such amounts to be recognized over time based on the contractual terms through March 2031. The variable consideration related to licensing arrangements is not disclosed as a remaining performance obligation as it qualifies for the sales-based royalty exemption. VF has also elected the practical expedient to not disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. 
 As of September 2024, there were no arrang ements with transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations other than contracts for which the Company has applied the practical expedients and the fixed consideration related to future minimum guarantees discussed above.

 billion, subject to customary adjustments for cash, indebtedness, working capital and transaction expenses as more fully set forth in the Purchase Agreement. On October 1, 2024, VF completed the sale of Supreme. VF received proceeds of billion, subject to post closing adjustments, and recognized an after-tax estimated loss on sale of Supreme of million, which is included in the income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended September 2024. VF used a portion of the net cash proceeds to prepay billion of its delayed draw Term Loan ("DDTL") pursuant to the terms of the DDTL Agreement, as amended, which required repayment within ten business days of VF s receipt of the net cash proceeds from the sale of Supreme. 
 During the three months ended September 2024, the Company determined that Supreme met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. Accordingly, b eginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2025, VF has reported the results of Supreme and the related cash flows as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively. The related held-for-sale assets and liabilities have been reported as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These changes have been applied to all periods presented. 
 The results of Supreme were previously reported in the Active segment. The results of Supreme recorded in the income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax line item in the 

Consolidated Statements of Operations were losses of million (including an after-tax estimated loss on sale of million) and million (including an after-tax estimated loss on sale of million and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of million) for the three and six months ended September 2024, respectively, and income of million and million for the three and six months ended September 2023 , respectively. 
 During the three months ended June 2024, VF determined that a triggering event had occurred requiring impairment testing of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. As a result of the impairment testing performed, VF recorded impairment charges of million and million to the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, respectively. 
 Under the terms of a transition services agreement, the Company will provide certain post-closing accounting, tax, treasury, digital technology, supply chain and human resource services on a transitional basis for periods generally up to 12 months from the closing date of the transaction. Under the terms of a secondment agreement, certain employees associated with the Supreme business will remain employees of VF and work exclusively in support of Supreme, and at Supreme's expense, through the end of Fiscal 2025. 
 Certain corporate overhead costs and segment costs previously allocated to the Supreme brand for segment reporting purposes did not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and have been allocated to continuing operations. In addition, interest expense and the related interest rate swap impact for the DDTL were reallocated to discontinued operations due to the requirement within the DDTL Agreement, as amended, that the DDTL be prepaid upon the receipt of the net cash proceeds from the sale of Supreme.

Without discrete items, the effective income tax rate for the six months ended September 2024 increased by compared with the 2023 period primarily due to disproportionate 

year-to-date losses in jurisdictions with no tax benefit, as well as the jurisdictional mix of earnings. 
 As previously reported, VF petitioned the U.S. Tax Court (the "Tax Court to resolve an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with VF s acquisition of The Timberland Company in September 2011. While the IRS argued that all such income should have been immediately included in 2011, VF reported periodic income inclusions in subsequent tax years. In Fiscal 2023, the Tax Court issued its final decision in favor of the IRS, which was appealed by VF. On October 19, 2022, VF paid million related to the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed, which was recorded as an income tax receivable and began to accrue interest income. These amounts were included in the other assets line item in VF's Consolidated Balance Sheet, based on our assessment of the position under the more-likely-than-not standard of the accounting literature. On September 8, 2023, the U.S. Court of

 million of income tax expense in the three months ended September 2023. This amount included the reversal of million of interest income, of which million was recorded in the first quarter of Fiscal 2024. This amount reflects the total estimated net impact to VF s tax expense, which includes the expected reduction in taxes paid on the periodic inclusions that VF has reported, release of related deferred tax liabilities, and consideration of indirect tax effects resulting from the decision. The estimated impact is subject to future adjustments based on finalization with tax authorities. 
 VF was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under Belgium s excess profit tax regime. During 2015, the European Union Commission ("EU") investigated and announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered the tax benefits to be collected from affected companies, including VF. During 2017 and 2018, VF Europe BVBA was assessed and paid million in tax and interest, which was recorded as an income tax receivable and was included in the other current assets line item in VF's Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on the expected success of the requests for annulment. After subsequent annulments and appeals, the General Court 

million of net income tax expense in the three months ended September 2023. 
 VF files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as separate and combined income tax returns in numerous state and international jurisdictions. In the U.S., the IRS examinations for tax years through 2015 have been effectively settled. In addition, VF is currently subject to examination by various state and international tax authorities. Management regularly assesses the potential outcomes of both ongoing and future examinations for the current and prior years and has concluded that VF s provision for income taxes is adequate. The outcome of any one examination is not expected to have a material impact on VF s consolidated financial statements. Management believes that some of these audits and negotiations will conclude during the next months. 
 During the six months ended September 2024, the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest decreased by million to million. Management believes that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits and interest may decrease during the next 12 months by approximately million due to settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations, of which million would reduce income tax expense.

 ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 VF Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, collectively known as VF or the Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31 of each year. The Company's current fiscal year runs from March 31, 2024 through March 29, 2025 ("Fiscal 2025"). Accordingly, this Form 10-Q presents our second quarter of Fiscal 2025. For presentation purposes herein, all references to periods ended September 2024 and September 2023 relate to the fiscal periods ended on September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. References to March 2024 relate to information as of March 30, 2024. 
 All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis and all percentages shown in the tables below and the following discussion have been calculated using unrounded numbers. References to the three and six months ended September 2024 foreign currency amounts and impacts below reflect the changes in foreign exchange rates from the three and six months ended September 2023 when translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. VF s most significant foreign currency exposure relates to business conducted in euro-based countries. Additionally, VF conducts business in other developed and emerging markets around the world with exposure to foreign currencies other than the euro. 
 On July 16, 2024, VF entered into a definitive Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with 

EssilorLuxottica S.A. to sell the Supreme brand business ("Supreme"). On October 1, 2024, VF completed the sale of Supreme. During the three months ended September 2024, the Company determined that Supreme met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. Accordingly, b eginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2025, VF has reported the results of Supreme and the related cash flows as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively. In addition, interest expense and the related interest rate swap impact for the delayed draw Term Loan ("DDTL") were reallocated to discontinued operations due to the requirement within the DDTL Agreement, as amended, that the DDTL be prepaid upon the receipt of the net cash proceeds from the sale of Supreme. The related held-for-sale assets and liabilities have been reported as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These changes have been applied to all periods presented. 
 Refer to Note 4 to VF s consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations. 
 Unless otherwise noted, amounts, percentages and discussion for all periods included below reflect the results of operations and financial condition from VF s continuing operations. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 Supreme Divestiture 
 As noted above, VF completed the sale of Supreme on October 1, 2024. VF received proceeds of 1.5 billion , subject to post closing adjustments, and recognized an after-tax estimated loss on sale of Supreme of 124.8 million, which is included in the income (loss) from discontinue d operations, net of tax line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended September 2024. VF used a portion of the net cash proceeds to prepay 1.0 billion of the DDTL on October 4, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the DDTL Agreement, as amended, which required repayment within ten business days of VF s receipt of the net cash proceeds from the sale of Supreme. 
 Reinvent 
 On October 30, 2023, VF introduced Reinvent, a transformation program to enhance focus on brand-building and to improve operating performance and allow VF to achieve its full potential. The first announced steps in this transformation, which cover the following priorities: improve North America results, deliver the Vans turnaround, reduce costs and strengthen the balance sheet, are as follows: 
 Establish global commercial organization, inclusive of an Americas region: VF changed the operating model with the establishment of a global commercial structure. This included the creation of an Americas regional platform, modeled on the Company's successful operations in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. With this change, VF created the role of Chief Commercial Officer, with responsibility for go-to-market execution globally. 
 Sharpen brand presidents' focus on sustainable growth: A direct consequence and intent of the operating model change, which is particularly critical at this stage for the 

Vans brand, enables brand presidents to direct greater focus and attention to long-term brand-building, product innovation and growth strategies. 
 Appoint new Vans President : Sun Choe was appointed the new Global Brand President of Vans effective late July 2024. 
 Optimize cost structure to improve operating efficiency and profitability: Actions have been implemented in a large-scale cost reduction program, which is expected to deliver 300 million in annual fixed cost savings, by removing spend in non-strategic areas of the business, and simplifying and right-sizing VF's structure. 
 Reduce debt and leverage: In addition to improving operating performance, VF is committed to deleveraging the balance sheet. VF used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Supreme to prepay the DDTL and the remaining proceeds will be applied to upcoming debt maturities. 
 During the second quarter of Fiscal 2025, the Company initiated the next phase of Reinvent, which is focused on a return to growth and improvements to profitability. In doing so, the Company initiated a set of transformational workstreams focused on revenue growth, margin expansion and selling, general and administrative expense contraction. 
 Reinvent restructuring charges in the three and six months ended September 2024 were 11.8 million and 25.4 million, respectively, and cumulative charges were 134.1 million since the inception of the program, which primarily included c osts associate d with severance and employee-related benefits and the impact of asset impairments and write-downs.

The increase in net interest expense in both the three and six months ended September 2024 was primarily due to changes in international rates and increased levels of short-term commercial paper borrowings at higher rates, partially offset by lower interest on long-term debt due to the repayment of 850.0 million 907.1 million) of long-term notes in September 2023. Total outstanding debt averaged 6.2 billion in the six months ended September 2024 and 6.9 billion in the same period in 2023, with weighted average interest rates of 2.7 and 2.3 in the six months ended September 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The declines in the three and six months ended September 2024 were primarily driven by a decrease in the Americas reg ion of 14 in both periods, reflecti ng lower inventory replenishment and weakness with certain key U.S. wholesale customer accounts. The declines were also attributed to a decrease in the Asia-Pacific region of 16 and 25 in the three and six months ended September 2024, respectively, including a 1 and 2 unfavorable im pact from foreign currency

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Consolidated Balance Sheets 

The following discussion refers to significant changes in balances at September 2024 compared to March 2024: 
 Increase in accounts receivable primarily due to the seasonality of the business and the timing of collections. 
 Increase in inventories primarily due to the seasonality of the business. 
 Increase in short-term borrowings primarily due to an increase in commercial paper borrowings. 
 Increase in the current portion of long-term debt due to the reclassification of 750.0 million of long-term notes due in April 2025. 
 Increase in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors and seasonality of inventory purchases. 
 Increase in accrued liabilities primarily due to higher accrued compensation and the timing of payments for other accruals. 
 Decrease in long-term debt due to the reclassification of 750.0 million of long-term notes due in April 2025. 

The following discussion refers to significant changes in balances at September 2024 compared to September 2023: 
 Decrease in inventories driven by VF reducing elevated inventory levels. 
 Decrease in property, plant and equipment, net primarily due to asset disposals and write-downs. 
 Decrease in goodwill primarily due to 507.6 million in impairment charges related to the Timberland, Dickies and Icebreaker reporting units recorded in the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2024. 
 Decrease in short-term borrowings primarily due to a decrease in commercial paper borrowings. 
 Increase in the current portion of long-term debt due to the reclassification of 750.0 million of long-term notes due in April 2025 and the reclassification of 1.0 billion of long-term debt due in December 2024 related to the DDTL. 
 Increase in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of inventory shipments from and payments to vendors. 
 Decrease in long-term debt due to the reclassification of 750.0 million of long-term notes due in April 2025 and the reclassification of 1.0 billion of long-term debt due in December 2024 related to the DDTL. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources: 
 September March September (Dollars in millions) 2024 2024 2023 Working capital 33.2 733.6 1,657.1 Current ratio 1.0 to 1 1.2 to 1 1.5 to 1 Net debt to total capital 83.6 80.1 77.4 
 
 The decrease in working capital and the current ratio at September 2024 compared to both March 2024 and September 2023 was primarily due to a net increase in current liabilities driven by a higher current portion of long-term debt and higher accounts payable, as discussed in the "Consolidated Balance Sheets" section above. The decrease in working capital and the current ratio at September 2024 compared to March 2024 was partially offset by a net increase in current assets driven by higher accounts receivable and inventories for the periods compared, as discussed in the "Consolidated Balance Sheets" section above. 

For the ratio of net debt to total capital, net debt is defined as short-term and long-term borrowings, in addition to operating lease liabilities, net of unrestricted cash. Total capital is defined as net debt plus stockholders equity. The increase in the net debt to total capital ratio at September 2024 compared to March 2024 was driven by an increase in net debt and a decrease in stockholders' equity for the periods compared. The increase in net debt was primarily driven by an increase in short-term borowings, as discussed in the "Consolidated Balance Sheet" section above, and lower cash and cash equivalents at September 2024 . The decrease in stockholders' equity at September 2024 compared to March 2024 was primarily driven by the net loss for the period and payments of dividends. The increase in the net debt to total capital ratio at September 2024

 compared to September 2023 was driven by a decrease in stockholders' equity, partially offset by a decrease in net debt for the periods compared. The decrease in stockholders' equity was primarily driven by the net loss for the period and payments of dividends. The decrease in net debt at September 2024 compared to September 2023 was driven by lower short-term borrowings, as discussed in the "Consolidated Balance Sheet" section above. 
 VF s primary source of liquidity is its expected annual cash flow from operating activities. Cash from operations is typically lower 

in the first half of the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the calendar year. Cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the calendar year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Additionally, direct-to-consumer sales are highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. VF's additional sources of liquidity include available borrowing capacity against its Global Credit Facility, available cash balances and international lines of credit. 

In summary, our cash flows from continuing operations were as follows: 
 Six Months Ended September (In thousands) 2024 2023 Cash used by operating activities (301,823) (60,720) Cash used by investing activities (16,421) (145,728) Cash provided (used) by financing activities 125,974 (125,901) 
 
 Cash Used by Operating Activities 
 Cash flows related to operating activities are dependent on income (loss) from continuing operations, adjustments to income (loss) from continuing operations and changes in working capital. The increase in cash used by operating activities in the six months ended September 2024 compared to September 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in income from continuing operations, excluding the write-off of income tax receivables and interest related to the Timberland tax case in the prior year, and an increase in net cash used by working capital. 
 Cash Used by Investing Activities 
 The decrease in cash used by investing activities in the six months ended September 2024 was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of assets of 76.7 million in the period, primarily related to a sale leaseback transaction of a distribution center, sale of a corporate-owned aircraft and sale of an aircraft hangar. The decrease was also due to a decrease in capital expenditures of 47.9 million and a decrease in software purchases of 15.4 million in the six months ended September 2024 compared to the 2023 period. 
 Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities 
 The increase in cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended September 2024 was primarily due to a 907.1 million payment of long-term debt in the six months ended September 2023 and a 163.1 million decrease in dividends paid for the periods compared. The increase was partially offset by a 818.6 million net decrease in short-term borrowings for the periods compared. 
 Share Repurchases 
 VF did not purchase shares of its Common Stock in the open market during the six months ended September 2024 or the six months ended September 2023 under the share repurchase program authorized by VF's Board of Directors. 
 As of the end of September 2024, VF had 2.5 billion remaining for future repurchases under its share repurchase authorization. VF's capital deployment priorities in the near-to-medium term 

will be focused on reducing leverage and reinvesting a portion of cost savings to drive profitable and sustainable growth. 
 Revolving Credit Facility, DDTL Agreement and Short-term Borrowings 
 VF relies on its ability to generate cash flows to finance its ongoing operations. In addition, VF has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities. VF maintains a 2.25 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the Global Credit Facility that expires in November 2026. VF may request an unlimited number of one-year extensions so long as each extension does not cause the remaining life of the Global Credit Facility to exceed five years, subject to stated terms and conditions; however, granting of any extension is at the discretion of the lenders. The Global Credit Facility may be used to borrow funds in U.S. dollars or any alternative currency (including euros and any other currency that is freely convertible into U.S. dollars, approved at the request of the Company by the lenders) and has a 75.0 million letter of credit sublimit. The Global Credit Facility supports VF s global commercial paper program for short-term, seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. Outstanding short-term balances may vary from period to period depending on the level of corporate requirements. 
 VF has restrictive covenants on its Global Credit Facility and DDTL Agreement, including a consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated net capitalization financial ratio covenant, as defined in the agreements as amended in August 2024 (effective for the first quarter of Fiscal 2025), starting at 70 with future step downs. The calculation of consolidated net indebtedness is net of unrestricted cash and the calculation of consolidated net capitalization permits certain addbacks, including non-cash impairment charges and material impacts resulting from adverse legal rulings, as defined in the amended agreements. The covenant calculation also excludes consolidated operating lease liabilities. Additionally, the amended agreements restrict the total amount of cash dividends and share repurchases to 500.0 million annually, on a calendar-year basis and require the repayment of the DDTL upon the completion of the Supreme sale. As of September 2024, VF was in compliance with all covenants. O n October 4, 2024, VF made an aggregate 1.0 billion prepayment of the DDTL using the net cash proceeds 

VF Corporation Q2 FY25 Form 10-Q 36 

Table of Contents 

 from the sale of Supreme, pursuant to the terms of the DDTL Agreement, as amended. 
 VF has a global commercial paper program that allows for borrowings of up to 2.25 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the Global Credit Facility. There were 450.0 million in U.S. commercial paper borrowings as of September 2024 . In addition to the U.S. commercial paper program, VF commenced a euro commercial paper borrowing program during the second quarter of Fiscal 2024. As of September 2024 , there were no outstanding euro commercial paper borrowings under this program. Standby letters of credit issued under the Global Credit Facility as of September 2024 were 0.6 million, leaving approximately 1.8 billion available for borrowing against the Global Credit Facility at September 2024, subject to applicable financial covenants. 
 VF has 96.6 million of international lines of credit with various banks, which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either VF or the banks. Total outstanding balances under these arrangements were 13.2 million at September 2024. 
 Additionally, VF had 492.2 million of unrestricted cash and equivalents at September 2024. 
 Supply Chain Financing Program 
 VF facilitates a voluntary supply chain finance ("SCF") program that enables a significant portion of our inventory suppliers to leverage VF's credit rating to receive payment from participating financial institutions prior to the payment date specified in the terms between VF and the supplier. The SCF program is administered through third-party platforms that allow participating suppliers to track payments from VF and elect which receivables, if any, to sell to the financial institutions. The transactions are at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and financial institutions, and VF is not a party to the agreements and has no economic interest in the supplier's decision to sell a receivable. The terms between VF and the supplier, including the amount due and scheduled payment terms (which are generally within 90 days of the invoice date) are not impacted by a supplier's participation in the SCF program. All amounts due to suppliers that are eligible to participate in the SCF program are included in the accounts payable line item in VF's Consolidated Balance Sheets and VF payments made under the SCF program are reflected in cash flows from operating activities in VF's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. At September 2024, March 2024 and September 2023, the accounts payable line item in VF s Consolidated Balance Sheets included total outstanding obligations of 804.9 million, 485.0 million and 688.0 million, respectively, due to suppliers that are eligible to participate in the SCF program. 
 Rating Agencies 
 At the end of September 2024, VF s long-term debt ratings were BBB- by Standard Poor s ("S P") Global Ratings and Ba1' by Moody s Investors Service ("Moody's"), and U.S. commercial 

paper ratings by those rating agencies were A-3 and NP , respectively. The Moody's rating for VF's euro commercial paper was also 'NP'. Based on VF's current ratings, the market for U.S. commercial paper is limited and there is no active market for euro commercial paper. VF's credit rating outlook by S P was 'negative' and Moody's was 'stable' at the end of September 2024. Further downgrades to VF's ratings would negatively impact borrowing costs. 
 None of VF s long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF, and as a result of the change in control the notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if required by the respective holders of the notes. The change of control provision applies to all notes, except for the notes due in 2033. 
 Dividends 
 The Company paid cash dividends of 0.09 and 0.18 per share during the three and six months ended September 2024, respectively, and the Company declared a cash dividend of 0.09 per share that is payable in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. Subject to approval by its Board of Directors, VF intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis in the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K provided a table summarizing VF s material contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of Fiscal 2024 that would require the use of funds. As of September 2024, there have been no material changes in the amounts of unrecorded commitments disclosed in the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K, except as noted below: 
 Contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of Fiscal 2024 included approximately 93.7 million of inventory obligations related to Supreme, which is now classified as discontinued operations. 
 Inventory purchase obligations decreased by approximately 944.0 million at the end of September 2024 primarily due to timing of inventory shipments and increased inventory levels. 
 VF entered into a contract with a consulting firm during the three months ended September 2024. Fees related to this contract could be up to 135.0 million, which includes 60.0 million of fixed fees and 75.0 million of contingent fees tied to increases in VF's stock price through June 2027. The total fair value of the contingent fees was 30.7 million as of September 2024. 
 Management believes that VF has sufficient liquidity and flexibility to operate its business and meet its current and long-term obligations as they become due.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management has chosen accounting policies it considers to be appropriate to accurately and fairly report VF s operating results and financial position in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Our critical accounting policies are applied in a consistent manner. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in VF's accounting policies from those disclosed in our Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. 
 The application of these accounting policies requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, 

assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions, and may retain outside consultants to assist in the evaluation. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. 
 The accounting policies that involve the most significant estimates, assumptions and management judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements, or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors, are discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis in the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. 

Cautionary Statement on Forward-looking Statements 

From time to time, VF may make oral or written statements, including statements in this quarterly report, that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. You can identify these statements by the fact that they use words such as "will," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "should," and "may," and other words and terms of similar meaning or use of future dates. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating to VF s operations or economic performance and assumptions related thereto. Forward-looking statements are made based on management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting VF and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. VF undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

 repurchase its stock in the future; climate change and increased focus on environmental, social and governance issues; VF's ability to execute on its sustainability strategy and achieve its sustainability-related goals and targets; risks arising from the widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis; and tax risks 

associated with the spin-off of the Jeanswear business completed in 2019. More information on potential factors that could affect VF s financial results is included from time to time in VF s public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including VF s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 
 There have been no significant changes in VF s market risk exposures from what was disclosed in Item 7A in the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures: 
 Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, a Disclosure Committee comprising various members of management has evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures at VF and its subsidiaries as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the Evaluation Date ). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded as of the Evaluation Date that such controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting: 
 There have been no changes during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, VF's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 Information on VF's legal proceedings is set forth under Part I, "Item 3. Legal Proceedings in the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the legal proceedings from those described in the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. 
 SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental regulations if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to SEC regulations, VF uses a threshold of 1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. VF believes that this threshold is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceedings that are material to VF s business or financial condition. Applying this threshold, there are no such proceedings to disclose for this period. 
 
 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS. 
 You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described in the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Other than the risk factor identified below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. 
 BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS 
 
 There are risks associated with VF s acquisitions, divestitures and portfolio management, including our recently completed sale of the Supreme brand business to EssilorLuxottica. 
 Any acquisitions, divestitures or mergers by VF, including our completed sale of the Supreme brand business to EssilorLuxottica, will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions or divestitures of companies, businesses or brands. These risks include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition or divestiture costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense of integrating or separating the operations, systems and personnel of the companies, businesses or brands, the loss of key employees and consumers as a result of changes in management or ownership, and slower 

progress toward environmental, social and governance goals given challenges with data acquisition and integration, the difficulty of accessing and disclosing sufficient environmental, social and governance data to comply with current and emerging environmental, social and governance regulations, and integration of environmental, social and governance initiatives overall. In addition, geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions or divestitures. Moreover, failure to effectively manage VF s portfolio of brands in line with growth targets and shareholder expectations, including acquisition choices, integration approach, transaction pricing 

39 VF Corporation Q2 FY25 Form 10-Q 

Table of Contents 

 and divestiture timing could result in unfavorable impacts to growth and value creation. 
 Our acquisitions and divestitures may cause large one-time expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges. We also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate, we may be exposed to losses that may be material. 

On July 17, 2024, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement for EssilorLuxottica to acquire the Supreme brand business from VF for 1.5 billion in cash, subject to customary adjustments for cash, indebtedness, working capital and transaction expenses. On October 1, 2024, we completed the Supreme sale. We may not realize some or all of the expected benefits from the sale of Supreme.
