Medical Device Products and Assemblies 

Total Revenues 

Other selling costs to obtain and fulfill contracts
are expensed as incurred due to the short-term nature of a majority of contracts. The Company extends terms of payment to its customers
based on commercially reasonable terms for the markets of its customers, while also considering their credit quality. Shipping and handling
costs charged to customers are included in revenue. 

Revenue recognition policies for each of the four
product and service types appear below. 

Engineering Design Services 

 The Company enters into contractual
agreements with its customers, including design services agreements, statements of work and receive purchase orders for development projects.
These agreements provide costs on an estimated basis for the services the Company has agreed to provide. Engineering Design Services are
rendered on a time and materials basis. The Company recognizes revenue as customers are invoiced for the actual engineering services provided
in the period. Revenue is also recognized on materials purchased for development projects at the time of receipt. Engineering Design Services
are provided on a best-efforts basis; no warranty is provided as there is no guarantee that the work will result in the attainment of
the customer s project objectives. The Company may obtain customer deposits in advance of rendering engineering design services.
Customer deposits are treated as contractual liabilities until the terms of customer agreements are satisfied and are not a component
of revenue. 

Optical Components, Finished Products and Assemblies 

 The Company provides fixed
price quotations to its customers and requires purchase orders for all purchased optical components, finished devices and assemblies.
Revenue is recognized at the time title passes to the Company s customers based on its review of the customer contract, generally
at the time of shipment from its facilities. Occasionally the Company may enter into bill and hold contractual arrangements
where title is held by its customers while goods are stored at our facilities for their convenience. 

Technology Rights and Royalties 

 The Company may recognize
revenue for the sale of technology rights and through the receipt of royalties obtained under a license of our intellectual property.
These revenues are recognized in the period in which, in our judgment, they are earned and no longer contingent under the terms and conditions
of the relevant customer contract. 

Contract Assets and Liabilities 

The nature of the Company s products and
services does not generally give rise to contract assets as it typically does not incur costs to fulfill a contract before a product or
service is provided to a customer. The Company s costs to obtain contracts are typically in the form of sales commissions paid to
employees. The Company has elected to expense sales commissions associated with obtaining a contract as incurred as the amortization period
is generally less than one year. These costs have been recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of September
30, 2024, there were no contract assets recorded in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The Company s contract liabilities arise
from unearned revenue received from customers at inception of contracts or where the timing of billing for services precedes satisfaction
of our performance obligations. The Company generally satisfies performance obligations within one year from the contract s inception
date. 

Contract liabilities, which are recorded in the
Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and unearned revenue are comprised of the following:

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to those
statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and with our audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2024 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on September 30, 2024. 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the words anticipate, suggest, estimate, plan, project, continue, ongoing, potential,
expect, predict, believe, intend, may, will, should, could, would and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in this report, the risks described in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe
the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, they relate only to events as of
the date on which the statements are made. We do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report
to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law. 

Overview 

We have been a developer and manufacturer of advanced
optical instruments since 1982. Our proprietary medical instrumentation line, unique custom design and manufacturing capabilities, and
expert engineering and development has generated traditional proprietary endoscopes and endocouplers as well as other custom imaging and
illumination products for our customers use in minimally invasive surgical procedures. We design and manufacture 3D endoscopes
and very small Microprecision lenses, assemblies and complete medical devices to meet the surgical community s continuing demand
for smaller, disposable, and more enhanced imaging systems for minimally invasive surgery. 

Effective June 1, 2019 we acquired the operating
assets of Ross Optical Industries, Inc. of El Paso, Texas. As Ross Optical Industries we also operate as a supplier of custom optical
components and assemblies for military and defense, medical and various other industrial applications. All products sold by us under the
Ross Optical name include a custom or catalog optic, which is sourced through our extensive domestic and worldwide network of optical
fabrication suppliers. Most systems make use of optical lenses, prisms, mirrors and windows and range from individual optical components
to complex mechano-optical assemblies. Products often include thin film optical coatings that are applied using our in-house coating department. 

Effective October 1, 2021 we acquired the operating
assets of Lighthouse Imaging, LLC of Windham, Maine. Our Lighthouse Imaging division supplements our operations as a manufacturer of advanced
optical imaging systems and accessories and has provided further expertise in electrical engineering and development of end-to-end medical
visualization devices. Product development competencies at Lighthouse Imaging include Systems, Optical, Mechanical, Electrical and Process
Development Engineering. Since the purchase we have integrated these acquired engineering and operational capabilities to provide an expanded,
unified offering to our customers. Our product development team has extensive experience developing visualization systems that are used
in a variety of clinical applications. Lighthouse Imaging is an industry leader in chip-on-tip visualization systems. 

The markets in which we do business are highly
competitive and include both foreign and domestic competitors. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources
than we do. Furthermore, other domestic or foreign companies, some with greater financial resources than we have, may seek to produce
products or services that compete with ours. Over the years we have developed extensive experience collaborating with other optical specialists
worldwide. 

13 

The markets for our products have increasingly
been driven by the demand for smaller and more enhanced imaging systems by the needs of the surgical community, including applications
for the brain, eye, ear, urology, cardiology/angiography and the spine. We market directly to established medical device companies primarily
in the United States that we believe could benefit from our advanced endoscopy visualization systems. Through this direct marketing, referrals,
attendance at trade shows and a presence in online professional association websites, we have expanded our on-going pipeline of projects
to significant medical device companies as well as well-funded emerging technology companies. We expect our customer pipeline to continue
to expand as development projects transition to production orders and new customer projects enter the development phase. Our Ross Optical
division markets through existing customers and trade shows, in addition to proactive online marketing strategies executed primarily through
its website. 

We produce micro-precision optics, which are millimeter-sized
and smaller cameras with low manufacturing costs. The small size provides visualization for new procedures in new parts of the body and
for existing procedures that are currently performed blind or with sub-optimal imaging, facilitating the development of new surgical procedures
that are currently impractical. We use patented and patent-pending approaches to fabricating opto-mechanical and opto-electronic systems.
We have developed and helped commercialize applications for numerous customers in the medical device and defense/aerospace industries. 

We believe that our future success depends to
a large degree on our ability to develop new optical products and services to enhance the performance characteristics and methods of manufacture
of existing products. Competition among medical device companies is increasing with multiple companies now pursuing less expensive, procedure
specific robotic systems. We expect to continue to seek and obtain product-related design and development contracts with customers and
to selectively invest our own funds on research and development, particularly in the areas of Microprecision TM optics, micro
medical cameras, illumination, single-use endoscopes, and 3D endoscopes. We are one of only a handful of companies in the world to design
and provide 3D endoscopes. By designing systems with low manufacturing costs, we have also begun to penetrate the single-use endoscope
market. Single-use endoscopes virtually eliminate the potential for patient cross-contamination and support a number of additional operational
benefits for hospitals and surgeons. We estimate this segment of the overall minimally invasive surgical market is growing at two to three
times the rate of the overall market. 

Current sales and marketing activities are intended
to broaden awareness of the benefits of our new technology platforms and our successful application of these new technologies to medical
device projects requiring surgery-grade visualization from millimeter sized devices and 3D endoscopy, including single-use products and
assemblies. 

We are registered to the ISO 9001:2015 and ISO
13485:2016 Quality Standards and comply with the FDA Good Manufacturing Practices.

General 

This management s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions and any such differences may be material. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

There have been no significant changes in our
critical accounting policies as disclosed in the Notes to our Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended June 30, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 30, 2024.

Total revenues for the quarter ending September
30, 2024 were 4,197,053, as compared to 4,321,255 for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of 124,202. Revenue from Engineering
Design Services decreased 2.6 during the quarter ending September 30, 2024 from the prior year period ending September 30, 2023. During
the quarter ending September 30, 2024 engineering capacity, and therefore billable revenues, was reduced as a result of increased research
and development activities. 

Revenue from Optical Components increased 9.3 
during the three-month period ending September 30, 2024 from the prior year period ending September 30, 2023. The market for Optical Components
was impacted beginning in the period ending September 30, 2023, as we noted lower order volumes as customers sought to rebalance their
inventories, and we believe a recovery is now underway. 

Revenue from Finished Products and Assemblies
decreased 48.6 during the quarter ending September 30, 2024 from the prior year quarter ending September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue
from Finished Products and Assemblies was primarily attributable to a manufacturing pause for a defense/aerospace customer that was occasioned
by a change in specification finalized late in the quarter ending September 30, 2024. 

Gross Profit 

Gross margin decreased to 26.6 during the quarter
ending September 30, 2024, compared to 33.9 for the quarter ending September 30, 2023. Gross profit decreased to 1,117,330 during the
three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,463,611 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by changes
in the product sales mix and the decreases in revenue discussed above. 

Research Development 

R D expenses increased 187,901 to 400,659
during the quarter ending September 30, 2024, compared to 212,758 during the quarter ending September 30, 2023. R D expenses for
the period represent employee-related expenses to support product improvements, the development of new technologies and standardized approaches
to address the opportunities for an evolving single-use medical device environment. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

SG A expenses increased 307,466, or 18.6 
to 1,963,612 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,656,146 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.
The increase in SG A for the three-month period was primarily due to increased recruitment costs, bad debt expense, consulting expenses
and information technology expenses. 

15 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Based on our current plans and business conditions, management believes
that the Company s available cash and cash equivalents, the cash generated from operations, availability on our line of credit,
and our ability to raise funds in the capital markets will be sufficient to provide for the Company s working capital and capital
expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the date of this filing. However, our cash on hand and cash generated solely from
operations may be insufficient to meet working capital needs for such period and we may be required to raise external financing in the
short-term. 

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 

During the three months ending September 30, 2024,
net cash used in operating activities totaled 318,622 and included a net loss of 1,311,247, increases in inventory of 592,521, offset
by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 1,016,135, decreases in accounts receivable net of decreased customer deposit
liabilities of 356,092, and non-cash items totaling 202,030. 

During the three months ending September 30, 2023,
net cash used in operating activities totaled 1,372,989 and included a net loss of 464,515, increases in inventory of 194,995, increases
in accounts receivable net of increased customer deposit liabilities of 375,426, decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of
 390,719, and non-cash items totaling 164,886. 

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 

During the three months ending September 30, 2024,
net cash used in investing activities was 28,099, consisting of purchases of property and equipment and patent costs. During the three
months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 43,517, consisting of purchases of property and equipment
and patent costs. 

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

During the three months ending September 30, 2024,
we made payments of 139,527 on term notes and capital leases and repaid 500,000 on our revolving line of credit. We raised a net of
 1,204,542 through the issuance of new shares in a registered direct common stock offering. During the three months ending September 30,
2023, we made payments of 138,876 on term notes and capital leases. 

Indebtedness 

In October 2021 we entered a 2,600,000 term loan
with a commercial bank. In June 2023 we added a second term loan in the amount of 750,000. We secured a 250,000 line of credit from
the same bank in October 2021 for working capital needs, which was increased to 500,000 in May 2022 and to 1,250,000 in June 2023. There
were 500,000 in borrowings outstanding on the line of credit on September 30, 2024 and additional availability in the amount of 750,000. 

Our loan agreement contains a minimum annual debt
service coverage ratio covenant of 1.2x, for the period ending June 30, 2024. We did not meet this annual debt service coverage ratio
as of June 30, 2024. Our lender has agreed to waive compliance with the debt service ratio covenant for the period ending June 30, 2024.
In addition to the waiver, we have entered into amendments dated September 30, 2024 with our lender to both term loans which provide for
a six month period of interest only payments from October 15, 2024 through March 15, 2025. We will begin to pay principal and interest
under the Notes beginning with the payments due on April 15, 2025, with a new amortization schedule for the remaining term for such Notes
through their maturity date. There were no other changes to or modifications to the Loan Agreement or the Notes. 

On August 14. 2024 we entered into securities
purchase agreements with institutional and accredited investors in addition to certain directors and officers of the Company for the purchase
and sale of 265,868 shares of the Company s common stock resulting in gross proceeds of approximately 1.4 million before deducting
placement agent commissions and other estimated offering expenses. Net proceeds were 1,204,542. 

Capital equipment expenditures and additional
patent costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and in the same period in the prior year were 28,099 and 43,517, respectively.

Contractual cash commitments for the fiscal periods
subsequent to September 30, 2024, are summarized as follows: 

Fiscal 2025

 11,478 
 149,428 

We have contractual cash commitments related to
open purchase orders as of September 30, 2024 of approximately 4,549,000. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

As a smaller reporting company, as defined by
Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and
therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal
executive officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control
over financial reporting, were effective as of September 30, 2024, to ensure the information we are required to disclose in reports that
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the
time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our disclosure controls and procedures are intended to be designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management. 

Material Weaknesses Previously Identified
and Remediation Status 

As disclosed in our Form 10-k for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 2024 we did not properly value our raw material and work-in-process inventory resulting in an overstatement of inventory
and an understatement of cost of goods sold in the amount of 320,000. We used a manually updated spreadsheet to maintain our records
of quantities and costs in inventory, prior to transitioning to a new ERP system. The new ERP system was not properly updated to reflect
current costs, and proper units of measure for certain items in inventory. During the quarter ending September 30, 2024, we conducted
a thorough review of inventory item costs, updating incorrect item costs and units of measure in the new ERP system and established a
methodology to continually monitor changes in costs through an analysis of purchase price variances and customer margin analysis. 

Additionally, we realized during the preparation
of the financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024 that we did not properly expense certain research and development
costs totaling 147,000, which was corrected prior to the filing of our financial statements on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June
30, 2024. We erroneously believed certain research and development costs were allowed to be capitalized under GAAP. The remediation of
this material weakness has now been completed. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Except for the material weaknesses and remediation
discussed above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

Our Company, on occasion, may be involved in legal
matters arising in the ordinary course of our business. While management believes that such matters are currently insignificant,
matters arising in the ordinary course of business for which we are or could become involved in litigation may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against
us or our officers and directors in their capacity as such that could have a material impact on our operations or finances. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

For information regarding factors that could affect
our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in Part I, Item
1A in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously

and Use of Proceeds.
