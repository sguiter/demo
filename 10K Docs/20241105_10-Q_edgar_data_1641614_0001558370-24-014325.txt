 Driven by a combination of our strong relationships, quality, technology, innovation, and supply-chain management, we believe we have strong positions in the following markets: the U.S. prepaid debit market, including the largest U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers; the U.S. small-to mid-sized financial institutions market, which includes independent community banks and credit unions; the U.S. large issuer market, serving some of the largest U.S. debit and credit card issuers; and the U.S. fintech market, where we produce and personalize Financial Payment Cards for financial technology companies. Our business consists of the following reportable segments: Debit and Credit, which primarily produces Financial Payment Cards and provides integrated card services, including digital services, to card-issuing financial institutions primarily in the United States; Prepaid Debit, which primarily provides integrated prepaid card services to Prepaid Debit Card program managers primarily in the United States; and Other, which includes corporate expenses. Trends and Uncertainties That May Affect our Financial Performance We experienced reduced demand from some of our customers for certain products and services during 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which impacted our financial and operating results. We believe the reduced demand was the result of economic and supply chain-related concerns, whereby certain customers increased their inventory of our products during 2022 and then focused on reducing their inventory levels in subsequent periods and may continue to further reduce their inventory levels before returning to normalized purchasing behavior. Additionally, liquidity concerns in the banking and financial services industry led to takeover of some banking and financial institutions by industry regulators during this period, which also affected demand. Although we believe the environment is improving and we experienced increased card volume sales and results in our Debit and Credit segment during the third quarter of 2024, we may experience reduced demand if any of the foregoing events continue or reoccur in the future.

Net sales increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher S ervices net sales in our Prepaid Debit segment and higher personalization services net sales in our Debit and Credit segment, partially offset by decreased Products net sales driven by lower card volumes in our Debit and Credit segment . Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin: Gross profit and gross profit margin increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to operating leverage from sales growth described above.

 Operating Expenses: Operating expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased compensation-related expenses, including increased employee performance-based incentive compensation and executive severance, partially offset by decreased impacts from an executive retention agreement entered into with our former CEO in 2023. Operating expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased compensation-related expenses, including increased employee performance-based incentive compensation, stock compensation, salary expense, and executive severance, partially offset by decreased impacts from an executive retention agreement entered into with our former CEO in 2023. Interest, net : Interest expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to payment of an early redemption premium of 5.8 million related to the redemption of the 267.9 million 8.625 Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Senior Notes ). Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 also increased due to the impact of the higher interest rates on the 285.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.000 Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Senior Notes issued in July 2024 compared to the 2026 Senior Notes. Loss on Debt Extinguishment: During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 3.0 million loss on debt extinguishment relating to the unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the redemption of the 2026 Senior Notes and the refinancing of our ABL Revolver Credit Agreement in July 2024. Other Expense, net: Other expense, net increased for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to expenses incurred related to a secondary offering of our common shares. See Note 10, Stockholders Deficit of the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Income Tax Expense: Our effective tax rates on pre-tax income were (57.9) and 37.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 24.0 and 30.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The benefit recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to increased deductibility of stock compensation realized upon certain stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by limitation of executive compensation deductibility related to the former CEO s retention agreement.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources At September 30, 2024, we had 14.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities, which has been driven from net income and fluctuations in working capital. Our working capital fluctuates primarily due to the timing of tax payments, timing of receipts from customers, inventory purchases, share repurchases (including the repurchase of incremental shares from Parallel49), payments of employee incentive programs and interest payments on our outstanding Senior Notes, with the interest payments being due in the first and third quarters of the year. Our ability to make investments in and grow our business, service our debt and improve our debt leverage ratios, while maintaining strong liquidity, depends on our ability to generate excess operating cash flows through our operating subsidiaries. Although we can provide no assurances, we believe that our cash flows from operations, combined with our current cash levels, and our senior secured revolving credit facility (the 2029 ABL Revolver with available borrowing capacity of 72.7 million as of September 30, 2024, will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash, as required, to support our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations, share repurchases and working capital needs. Our future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions, especially those impacting our customers, and the pricing, terms and availability of goods and services that we purchase, and financings that we enter into. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 16.7 million from 22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to changes in working capital. Working capital changes included increased inventory purchases related to the capacity reservation agreement we entered into with one of our suppliers in 2022, incentives related to a customer contract entered into in the first quarter of 2024, and a 5.0 million payment pursuant to an agreement entered into on June 2, 2023 with the Company s prior Chief Executive Officer, who departed in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower employee performance-based incentive compensation payments in 2024 related to 2023 performance as compared to those made in 2023 related to 2022 performance. Additionally, we anticipate cash flows from operating activities to be negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to incentives related to the customer contract as described above. Financing As of September 30, 2024, we had the following outstanding borrowings: 

September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands) 2029 Senior Notes 285,000 2026 Senior Notes 267,897 Unamortized deferred financing costs (4,848) (2,900) Total long-term debt 280,152 264,997 2029 Senior Notes On July 11, 2024 (the Closing Date ), we completed a private offering by our wholly-owned subsidiary, CPI CG Inc. (the Issuer ), of 285.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.000 Senior Secured Notes due 2029 and related guarantees at an issue price of 100 . The notes and related guarantees were offered and sold in a private transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States to certain non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. Net proceeds from the 2029 Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem the entire principal balance of 267.9 million of 8.625 Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Senior Notes as of the Closing Date, and to pay related fees, an early redemption premium of 2.156 , and other expenses. The early redemption premium paid is recorded in Interest, net on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 The 2029 Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2029. Interest is payable on the 2029 Senior Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025. The 2029 Senior Notes are guaranteed by us and our domestic subsidiaries (other than the Issuer), and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the guarantors, subject to customary exceptions. We may be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2029 Senior Notes, upon the occurrence of certain events including a change of control or certain asset sales. 2029 ABL Revolver On the Closing Date, we and CPI CG Inc. as borrower (the Borrower ), entered into a credit agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as lender, administrative agent and collateral agent, providing for an asset-based, senior secured revolving credit facility (the 2029 ABL Revolver of up to 75.0 million (the Maximum Revolver Amount ). The 2029 ABL Revolver is guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries), and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Borrower and the subsidiary guarantors, subject to customary exceptions. The 2029 ABL Revolver consists of revolving loans, letters of credit and swing line loans provided by lenders, with a sublimit on letters of credit outstanding at any time of 10.0 million. The 2029 ABL Revolver also includes an uncommitted accordion feature whereby the Borrower may increase the 2029 ABL Revolver commitment by an aggregate amount not to exceed 25.0 million, subject to certain conditions. The 2029 ABL Revolver matures on the earliest to occur of July 11, 2029 and the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of the 2029 Senior Notes. As of the Closing Date, we had 4.0 million of outstanding borrowings under a prior Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into in March 2021 (the 2026 ABL Revolver ). We used initial borrowings under the 2029 ABL Revolver, together with cash on hand and proceeds under the notes, to repay in full and terminate the 2026 ABL Revolver and to pay related fees and expenses, and will use future borrowings for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the 2029 ABL Revolver bear interest at a rate per annum that ranges based on the applicable term secured overnight financing rate SOFR as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 1.50 to 1.75 , (subject, in each case, to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 based on the average daily borrowing capacity under the 2029 ABL Revolver over the most recently completed month. The unused portion of the 2029 ABL Revolver commitment accrues a commitment fee, which ranges from 0.375 to 0.50 per annum, based on the average daily excess availability under the 2029 ABL Revolver over the immediately preceding month. The 2029 ABL Revolver includes limitations on the Borrower s ability to borrow in certain situations, including limitations based on the calculation of borrowing capacity and further limitations that are triggered if the amount available to borrow under the ABL Revolver is less than the greater of 7.5 million and 10 of the Maximum Revolver Amount. The borrowing capacity represents the net availability under the ABL Revolver and is calculated as the lesser of a) the total of certain eligible assets, including cash, accounts receivable and inventories, further reduced by stated contribution percentages and adjustments Borrowing Base and b) the Maximum Revolver Amount. The Borrowing Base is further reduced by credit line reserves, letters of credit, as well as the loan ledger balance outstanding on the ABL Revolver. Additionally, commencing with the month immediately following a date on which borrowing capacity is below the greater of 7.5 million and 10 of the Maximum Revolver Amount and until such time that borrowing capacity equals or exceeds the greater of 7.5 million and 10 of the Maximum Revolver Amount for 30 consecutive days, the Company must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement for the ABL Revolver) of at least 1.00 to 1.00, calculated for the trailing 12 months, in order to borrow under the ABL Revolver. Cash Priorities Capital Expenditures We primarily use cash in investing activities for capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, capital expenditures, including investments to support the business, such as machinery and information technology equipment, totaled 4.2 million. During 2023, we commenced work on relocating and modernizing our production facility in Indiana. We anticipate this project will extend into 2025. Total capital expenditures, net for this project are anticipated to increase cash used in investing activities and assets acquired under lease arrangements in 2025.
