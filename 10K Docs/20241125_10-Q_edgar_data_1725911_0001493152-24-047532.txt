financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. 

Although
we believe that our expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds
of our knowledge of our business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections, the inclusion
of forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our
objectives or plans will be achieved. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Except to the
extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, or other information contained
herein, whether as a result of new information, future events, a change in events, conditions, circumstances or assumptions underlying
such statements, or otherwise. We caution you therefore that you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements as statements
of historical fact or as guarantees or assurances of future performance.

of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management, all
material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these audited condensed
financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

in this section to NetBrands, we, us, our, the Company and our
Company refer to NetBrands Corp. and its consolidated subsidiary, Global Diversified Holdings, Inc. 

Overview 

We
are an early stage diversified holdings company which sells multiple products under common management with one of them a global multi-line
consumer packaged goods CPG company with branded product lines in the food and snack industry. This division operates
as marketer and distributor in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Another division is focused and involved in building and acquiring
ecommerce assets as well as private businesses in various verticals with the goal of scaling them up and increasing revenue. 

The
Company was incorporated on December 1, 2017, as a Delaware corporation under the name Dense Forest Acquisition Corporation. 
On June 13, 2018, in anticipation of its acquisition of Global Diversified Holdings, Inc. GDHI ), a private New York snack
and gourmet food company, the Company changed its to Global Diversified Marketing Group Inc. Prior to consummation of this
acquisition, the Company had no business and no operations. On November 26, 2018, the Company acquired the operations and business plan
of GDHI, to develop and market healthy snack foods, and it became our wholly owned operating subsidiary. 

4 

On
August 31, 2022, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement with InPlay Capital Inc.,
a Delaware corporation InPlay ), pursuant to which, on the same date, the Company purchased from InPlay all of the assets
used in the operation and conduct of its business relating to the online home fitness store known as The Hula Fit , including
the Shopify Store and the TikTok, Facebook and Google ad accounts, for a purchase price of 50,000. Paul Adler, the sole executive officer
and a director of the Company, and the Company s majority stockholder, is also the sole officer, director, and 100 stockholder
of InPlay. The Company intends to make additional acquisitions of e-commerce businesses and assets in an attempt to grow its digital
business. 

On
March 29, 2023, the Company filed an Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation effecting the change of the Company s name to
NetBrands Corp., a name that reflected the planned expansion of the Company s digital business. 

Going
forward, we intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose
business presents an opportunity for our shareholders. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific
business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. Further, we may acquire or combine with a venture
that is in its preliminary or early stages of development, one that is already in operation, or one that is in a more mature stage of
its corporate existence. Accordingly, business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development,
all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex. The analysis
of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our executive officers and directors, none of whom is
a business analyst. Therefore, it is anticipated that outside consultants or advisors may be utilized to assist us in the search for
and analysis of qualified target companies.

Developments 

Purchase
Agreement with 1800 Diagonal 

On
June 6, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the 1800 Purchase Agreement with 1800 Diagonal
Lending LLC, a Virginia limited liability company 1800 Diagonal ), pursuant to which the Company issued 1800 Diagonal an
unsecured convertible promissory note (the 1800 Diagonal Note ). The 1800 Diagonal Note had a principal balance of 117,320,
and a stated maturity date of April 15, 2024. A one-time interest charge of 13 , or 15,251, was applied on the date of issuance and
was immediately expensed. The 1800 Diagonal Note provided that the interest and outstanding principal shall be paid in nine payments,
each in the amount of 14,730.11 (a total payback to 1800 Diagonal of 132,571), starting on July 15, 2023, with eight subsequent payments
due each month thereafter. 

The
Company did not make payments when required under the 1800 Diagonal Note, resulting in a default and the commencement of a lawsuit against
the Company by 1800 Diagonal Lending in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia (the Action seeking to recover 151,325.08
of outstanding indebtedness due under the 1800 Diagonal Note. As of January 10, 2024, the Company acknowledged the outstanding indebtedness
under the 1800 Diagonal Note, and agreed to pay 1800 Diagonal (a) 5,000 on each of March 1, 2024, April 1, 2024, and May 1, 2024, and
(b) 7,500 on June 1, 2024, and the 1st day of each successive month thereafter until the indebtedness is paid in full (anticipated to
span approximately 18 months). Provided that all payments are timely made, 1800 Diagonal agreed to forbear and not (a) prosecute the
Action, or (b) convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid amount of the 1800 Diagonal Note into shares of the Company s
common stock. Any payment not timely received shall constitute a default, and upon such default 1800 Diagonal s forbearance shall
immediately be vacated and 1800 Diagonal shall be free, without restriction, to pursue the Action. 

Purchase
Agreement with Cove Funding 

On
March 22, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Cove Purchase Agreement with Cove Funding
LP, a Delaware limited partnership Cove Funding ), pursuant to which Cove Funding agreed to loan the Company up to 300,000,
in two tranches (the Cove Loan ), and the Company issued Cove Funding a 12 senior secured convertible promissory note (the
 Cove Note ), evidencing the first tranche of the Cove Loan (the First Tranche ). The Company received net proceeds
of 150,000 (after deducting a 5 commitment fee, a 5 diligence fee, and Cove Funding s fees and expenses related to the transaction,
including attorney s fees). The difference between the amount of the First Tranche and 300,000 (less a 5 commitment fee, a 5 
diligence fee, and Cove Funding s fees and expenses related to the transaction, including attorney s fees) may be funded
in a second tranche (the Second Tranche and, together with the First Tranche, the Principal Amount ), upon
the Company s written request, and subject to certain conditions. 

5 

The
Cove Note has a stated maturity date of July 22, 2024 (as such date may be extended by the parties, the Maturity Date ),
and an interest rate of 12 per annum, which begins to accrue on the First Tranche on the Closing Date and will begin to accrue on the
Second Tranche if and when such amount is funded by Cove Funding. Any Principal Amount that is not paid when due will bear interest at
a rate of the lesser of (a) 24 per annum, or (b) the maximum amount permitted by law. The Cove Convertible Note may not be prepaid in
whole or in part, except as otherwise set forth in the Cove Note. Pursuant to the terms of Cove Note, if the Cove Loan is not repaid
on or before the Maturity Date, the Company is required to issue Cove Funding shares of its Common Stock, on a monthly basis (subject
to a 4.99 beneficial ownership limitation), with a value of 16.67 of the principal amount of the Cove Loan outstanding as of each issuance
date, plus a commitment fee equal to 5 of such outstanding principal amount, until the Cove Loan is repaid in full (collectively, the
 Penalty Shares ). In addition, commencing on the Maturity Date, Cove Funding may (subject to a 4.99 beneficial ownership
limitation) convert amounts due under the Cove Note into shares of the Company s Common Stock (collectively, the Conversion
Shares at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (a) 0.07, or (b) the five-trading day closing price average immediately
prior to the conversion date. The number of Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion of the Cove Note will be subject to adjustment
from time-to-time in the event of any combination, extraordinary distribution, dilutive issuance, or similar event. Upon the occurrence
of an event of default under the Cove Note, 125 of the amounts due under the Cove Note will become immediately due and payable. In addition,
as long as the Company has any obligations outstanding under the Cove Note, the Company may not (among other things), without Cove Funding s
written consent, incur any senior or pari passu indebtedness, sell a significant amount of the Company s assets, or issue equity
securities in an amount greater than 10 of the Company s outstanding Common Stock, subject to certain exceptions. 

In
order to further induce Cove Funding to make the Cove Loan to the Company, (a) the Company entered into a security agreement with Cove
Funding (the Cove Security Agreement ), pursuant to which Cove Funding was granted a first priority security interest in
the Company s assets, and (b) Paul Adler, the Company s President, and a director of the Company, entered into a pledge agreement
with Cove Funding (the Cove Pledge Agreement ), pursuant to which Mr. Adler pledged 1,000 shares of the Company s
Class A Super Voting Preferred Stock and 11,568,843 shares of the Company s common stock that he owns (collectively, the Adler
Shares ). As a result, if the Company defaults on its obligations under the Cove Note, Cove Funding could foreclose on their security
interests and liquidate or take possession of some or all of the assets of the Company and/or the Adler Shares, which would harm our
business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to curtail, or even to cease our operations. 

Currently
the Cove funding is in default and Cove Funding is in negotiations with Mr. Adler on how to address the default. 

Addendum
to the Engagement Agreement with Spencer Clarke 

On
March 22, 2024, the Company and Spencer Clarke, LLC Spencer Clarke executed an addendum to their engagement agreement
for investment banking related services, dated November 14, 2022 (the Engagement Agreement ), pursuant to which the term
of the Engagement Agreement was further extended to June 21, 2024, as such term may be further extended pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Engagement Agreement. 

In
addition, in connection with the closing of the Cove Loan, the Company (a) paid Spencer Clarke a cash fee of 25,000 (for up to 300,000
raised in the financing), and (b) issued Spencer Clarke a Common Stock Purchase Warrant (the Warrant to purchase 814,285
shares of the Company s Common Stock (for up to 300,000 raised in the financing) (the Warrant Shares ). The Warrant
is exercisable for a term of five years from the date of issuance. The Warrant has an exercise price of 0.07 per share, subject to adjustment.
The Warrant may be exercised for cash, or on a cashless basis. Spencer Clarke may not exercise the Warrant with respect to any number
of shares that would cause it to beneficially own in excess of 9.99 of the Company s number of issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock, waivable upon 61 days prior notice to the Company. The exercise price of the Warrant is subject to adjustment for
subdivision or consolidation of the Company s shares, or other dilutive issuances. Spencer Clarke has piggyback registration rights
with respect to the Warrant Shares.

Results
of Operations 

The
information set forth below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report. 

Comparison
of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues
and Cost of Sales 

Sales
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were -0- compared to sales of 71,938 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 

During
2023 we incurred a significant loss of revenue due to the supply, shipping and logistic issues, transitioning from a public warehouse
to our own warehousing facility, and the significant loss of revenue on a product with eight SKUs that was produced in Russia that is
no longer available to us. Without having an adequate amount of inventory on hand to fulfill existing and future orders, and our lack
of sufficient liquidity, our ability to conduct future business with our customers is materially impaired. We are currently seeking new
lines of business, new sources of liquidity and an acquisition target. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise capital it will
have a material adverse impact on our Company on our ability to remain a going concern. 

Operating
expenses 

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 52,122 compared to 151,697 during the same three months ended September
30, 2023. The material decrease in expenses is attributable to limited expenses due to the lack of revenue in the 2024 period. 

Other
income and (expense) 

Other
income (expense) is comprised solely of interest expense and finance charges related to our fundings. Other expense was 4,117 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 304,372 in other expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
loss 

As
a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of 56,239 or (0.00) per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to a loss of 422,740 or (0.03) per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Comparison
of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues
and Cost of Sales 

Sales
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were -0- compared to sales of 584,004 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 

During
2023 we incurred a significant loss of revenue due to the supply, shipping and logistic issues, transitioning from a public warehouse
to our own warehousing facility, and the significant loss of revenue on a product with eight SKUs that was produced in Russia that is
no longer available to us. Without having an adequate amount of inventory on hand to fulfill existing and future orders, and our lack
of sufficient liquidity, our ability to conduct future business with our customers is materially impaired. We are currently seeking new
lines of business, new sources of liquidity and an acquisition target. 

We
have not generated any sales in 2024 and have no inventory on hand. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise capital it will have
a material adverse impact on our Company and our ability to remain a going concern. 

Operating
expenses 

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 791,991 compared to 933,818 during the same nine months ended September
30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we incurred 425,139 in non-cash stock based compensation compared to 164,500
during the same three month period ended in 2023. 

Other
income and (expense) 

Other
expense is comprised solely of interest expense and finance charges related to our fundings. Other expense was 237,217 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 407,987 in other expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of
higher levels of borrowings due to the loss of liquidity from operating activities. 

7 

Net
loss 

As
a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of 1,029,210 or (0.05) per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to a loss of 1,140,565 or (0.07) per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 9 in cash, compared to 1,013 in cash as of December 31, 2023. 

Net
cash used in operating activities decreased to 182,111 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 384,447 in the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in operating is primarily due to changes in balance sheet accounts and reduced
activities at the Company. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 181,107 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 330,262 of net cash
provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash provided in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, is primarily due to lower proceeds from notes and loans payable. 

The
Company has historically financed its operations through the cash flow generated from operations, capital investment, notes payable and
factoring. 

On
March 22, 2024, the Company received net proceeds of 150,000 from the Cove Loan. The Company used the net proceeds for working capital. 

In
the event continuing lack of sales, our ability to obtain additional financing could be negatively impacted which could have a material
adverse impact on our liquidity or our ability to remain as a going concern. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following the
date of these condensed financial statements. On a consolidated basis, we have incurred significant operating losses since inception.
The Company s independent auditor has indicated substantial doubt about the Company continuing as a going concern based on the
Company s accumulated deficit and accrued liabilities. Our ability to continue our operations as a going concern, realize the carrying
value of our assets, and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent upon our ability to raise capital sufficient
to fund our commitments and ongoing losses, and ultimately generate profitable operations. If we cannot obtain needed funds, we may be
forced to reduce or cease our activities with a consequent loss to investors. In addition, should we incur significant presently unforeseen
expenses or delays, we may not be able to accomplish our goals. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
condensed financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed
financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare our condensed financial statements.
The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual
amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management
estimates and are deemed critical to our results of our operations or financial position. Our critical accounting estimates are more
fully discussed in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed financial statements contained herein.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial
Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), who is directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Company, as of September
30, 2024, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule
15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer
and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30,
2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act were recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Act Commission s rules and
forms and that our disclosure controls are effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Our
management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent
all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdown can occur because
of simple error or mistake. In particular, many of our current processes rely upon manual reviews and processes to ensure that neither
human error nor system weakness has resulted in erroneous reporting of financial data. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were determined to be effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the period covered by this Quarterly Report, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
