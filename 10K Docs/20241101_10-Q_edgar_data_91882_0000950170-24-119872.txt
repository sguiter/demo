Dominion Energy South Carolina, Inc. 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (Unaudited) 
 The following notes should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in DESC s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 These are interim financial statements and, due to the seasonality of DESC s business and matters that may occur during the rest of the year, the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are not necessarily indicative of amounts expected for the full year. In the opinion of management, the information furnished herein reflects all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods reported, and such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise noted. In addition, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Certain amounts in DESC s 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes have been reclassified to conform to the 2024 presentation for comparative purposes; however, such reclassifications did not affect DESC s net income and other comprehensive income, total assets, liabilities, equity or cash flows. 
 DESC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SCANA, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy. 

10 

Other Regulatory Matters Other than the following matters, there have been no significant developments regarding the pending regulatory matters disclosed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in DESC s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Electric Base Rate Case In March 2024, DESC filed its retail electric base rate case and schedules with the South Carolina Commission. DESC proposed a non-fuel, base rate increase of million, partially offset by a net decrease in storm damage and DSM components of million. If approved, the overall proposed rate increase of million, or , would be effective on and after the first billing cycle of September 2024. The base rate increase was proposed to recover the significant investment in assets and operating resources required to serve an expanding customer base, maintain the safety, reliability and efficiency of DESC s system and meet increasingly stringent reliability, security and environmental requirements for the benefit of South Carolina customers. DESC presented an earned ROE of based upon a fully-adjusted test period. The proposed rates would provide for an earned ROE of compared to the currently authorized ROE of . In July 2024, DESC, the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and other parties of record filed a comprehensive settlement agreement with the South Carolina Commission for approval. The comprehensive settlement agreement provides for a non-fuel, base rate increase of million prior to the effect of South Carolina Commission-ordered DSM reductions commencing with service rendered on September 1, 2024 and an authorized ROE of . In addition, the comprehensive settlement agreement includes that DESC would provide a one-time bill credit in 2024 of approximately million primarily to residential customers. In August 2024, the South Carolina Commission voted to approve the settlement agreement. In connection with this matter, in the third quarter of 2024 DESC recorded a charge of million million after tax) (reflected within the Corporate and Other segment), composed of million within impairment of assets and other charges, including million to write down certain materials and supplies inventory, and million within other income (expense), net. Electric Cost of Fuel DESC s retail electric rates include a cost of fuel component approved by the South Carolina Commission which may be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the price of fuel purchased by DESC. In February 2024, DESC filed with the South Carolina Commission a proposal to decrease the total fuel cost component of retail electric rates. DESC s proposed adjustment is designed to recover DESC s current base fuel costs, including its existing under-collected balance, over the 12-month period beginning with the first billing cycle of May 2024. In addition, DESC proposed an increase to its variable environmental and avoided capacity cost component. The net effect is a proposed annual decrease of million. In March 2024, DESC, the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and another party of record filed a settlement agreement with the South Carolina Commission for approval to make certain adjustments to the February 2024 filing that would result in a net annual decrease of million. In April 2024, the South Carolina Commission voted to approve the settlement agreement, with rates effective May 2024. Electric - Transmission Project In March 2024, DESC filed an application with the South Carolina Commission requesting approval of a CPCN to construct and operate the Church Creek - Charleston Transmission Line, comprised of a -mile kV transmission line and associated facilities in Charleston County, South Carolina with an estimated total project cost of million. In July 2024, the South Carolina Commission approved the application. Electric Other DESC has approval for a DSM rider through which it recovers expenditures related to its DSM programs. In January 2024, DESC filed an application with the South Carolina Commission seeking approval to recover million of costs and net lost revenues associated with these programs, along with an incentive to invest in such programs. DESC requested that rates be effective with the first billing cycle of May 2024. In April 2024, the South Carolina Commission approved the request, effective with the first billing cycle of May 2024. DESC utilizes a pension costs rider approved by the South Carolina Commission which is designed to allow recovery of projected pension costs, including under-collected balances or net of over-collected balances, as applicable. The rider is typically reviewed for adjustment every 12 months with any resulting increase or decrease going into effect beginning with the first billing cycle in May. In February 2024, DESC requested that the South Carolina Commission approve an adjustment to this rider to increase annual revenue by million. In April 2024, the South Carolina Commission approved the request. 

 11 

million. This represents a million base rate increase, after certain adjustments, under the terms of the Natural Gas Rate Stabilization Act effective with the first billing cycle of November 2024. In October 2024, the South Carolina Commission approved a million base rate increase after certain adjustments, effective with the first billing cycle of November 2024. Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities Rate-regulated utilities recognize in their financial statements certain revenues and expenses in different periods than do other enterprises. As a result, DESC has recorded regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities which are summarized in the following table. Except for NND Project costs and certain other unrecovered costs referenced herein, substantially all regulatory assets are either explicitly excluded from rate base or are effectively excluded from rate base due to their being offset by related liabilities.

Regulatory assets have been recorded based on the probability of their recovery. All regulatory assets represent incurred costs that may be deferred under GAAP for regulated operations. The South Carolina Commission or FERC has reviewed and approved through specific orders certain of the items shown as regulatory assets. In addition, regulatory assets include, but are not limited to, certain costs which have not been specifically approved for recovery by one of these regulatory agencies. While such costs are not currently being recovered, management believes that they would be allowable under existing rate-making concepts embodied in rate orders or applicable state law and expects to recover these costs through rates in future periods.

In addition, in 2023, FERC granted GENCO authority through March 2025 to issue short-term indebtedness not to exceed million outstanding with maturity dates of or less. At September 30, 2024 , GENCO had drawn on million of its intercompany credit facility with Dominion Energy, as permitted by this FERC authorization. DESC is obligated with respect to an aggregate of million of industrial revenue bonds which are secured by letters of credit. These letters of credit expire, subject to renewal, in the fourth quarter of 2025. DESC, GENCO and Fuel Company each have intercompany credit facilities with Dominion Energy with a maximum capacity of million, million and million, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , DESC, GENCO and Fuel Company collectively had borrowings outstanding under these agreements totaling million and million, respectively, which are recorded in affiliated and related party payables in DESC s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest charges associated with these agreements were million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In May 2024, following approval from the South Carolina Commission, GENCO amended its million promissory note due to Dominion Energy to change the maturity date from to and the interest rate from to .

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , DESC made million and million of contributions to its qualified pension plan. In October 2024, DESC made an additional million of contributions to its qualified pension plan. DESC is not required to make any additional contributions to its qualified pension plan in 2024 and expects to receive reimbursement for such contributions from Santee Cooper. DESC recovers current pension costs through either a rate rider that may be adjusted annually for retail electric operations or through cost of service rates for gas operations. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Remeasurements In the third quarter of 2024, the pension and other postretirement benefit plans were remeasured as a result of the close of the PSNC Transaction. The remeasurement of pension plan assets and liabilities resulted in a net increase in the pension benefit plan asset of million. In addition, the remeasurement of other postretirement benefit plan assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in the postretirement benefit plan liability of million. The discount rate used for the remeasurement was for the pension plans and for the other postretirement benefit plans.

million of charges in aggregate for various personal injury or wrongful death cases. DESC s Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024 includes million of insurance receivables related to personal injury or wrongful death cases. Environmental Matters DESC is subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations. From a regulatory perspective, DESC continually monitors and evaluates its current and projected emission levels and strives to comply with all state and federal regulations regarding those emissions. DESC participates in the SO 2 and NO x emission allowance programs with respect to coal plant emissions and also has constructed additional pollution control equipment at its coal-fired electric generating plants. These actions are expected to address many of the rules and regulations discussed herein. Air The CAA, as amended, is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation s air quality. At a minimum, states are required to establish regulatory programs to meet applicable requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of DESC s facilities are subject to the CAA s permitting and other requirements. ACE Rule In July 2019, the EPA published the final rule informally referred to as the ACE Rule, as a replacement for the Clean Power Plan. The ACE Rule regulated GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants pursuant to Section 111(d) of the CAA and required states to develop plans by July 2022 establishing unit-specific performance standards for existing coal-fired power plants. In January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE Rule and remanded it to the EPA. This decision would take effect upon issuance of the court s mandate. In March 2021, the court issued a partial mandate vacating and remanding all parts of the ACE Rule except for the portion of the ACE Rule that repealed the Clean Power Plan. In October 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit s decision on the ACE Rule. In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit s decision on the ACE Rule and remanded the case back to the D.C. Circuit. In May 2024, the EPA repealed the ACE Rule as part of a package of final rules addressing CO 2 emissions from new and existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. Carbon Regulations In August 2016, the EPA issued a draft rule proposing to reaffirm that a source s obligation to obtain a PSD or Title V permit for GHGs is triggered only if such permitting requirements are first triggered by non-GHG, or conventional, pollutants that are regulated by the New Source Review program, and exceed a significant emissions rate of tons per year of CO 2 equivalent emissions.

mandatory facility-specific factors, including a social cost-benefit test, and optional facility-specific factors. The rule governs all electric generating stations with water withdrawals above MGD, with a heightened entrainment analysis for those facilities over MGD. DESC has facilities that are subject to the final regulations. DESC is also working with the EPA and state regulatory agencies to assess the applicability of Section 316(b) to hydroelectric facilities. DESC anticipates that it may have to install impingement control technologies at certain of these stations that have once-through cooling systems. DESC is currently evaluating the need or potential for entrainment controls under the final rule as these decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after a thorough review of detailed biological, technological and cost benefit studies. DESC is conducting studies and implementing plans as required by the rule to determine appropriate intake structure modifications at certain facilities to ensure compliance with this rule. While the impacts of this rule could be material to DESC s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory framework in South Carolina provides rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts for DESC. Effluent Limitations Guidelines In September 2015, the EPA released a final rule to revise the ELG Rule. The final rule established updated standards for wastewater discharges that apply primarily at coal and oil steam generating stations. Affected facilities are required to convert from wet to dry or closed cycle coal ash management, improve existing wastewater treatment systems and/or install new wastewater treatment technologies in order to meet the new discharge limits. In April 2017, the EPA granted separate petitions for reconsideration of the final ELG Rule and stayed future compliance dates in the rule. Also in April 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted the EPA s request for a stay of the pending consolidated litigation challenging the rule while the EPA addresses the petitions for reconsideration. In September 2017, the EPA signed a rule to postpone the earliest compliance dates for certain waste streams regulations in the final ELG Rule from November 2018 to November 2020; however, the latest date for compliance for these regulations was December 2023. In October 2020, the EPA released the final rule that extended the latest dates for compliance with individual facilities compliance dates that would vary based on circumstances and the determination by state regulators and may range from to . In May 2024, the EPA released a final rule revising the 2015 and 2020 Effluent Limitations Guidelines, establishing more stringent standards for wastewater discharges for the Steam Electric Power Generating Category, which apply primarily to wastewater discharges at coal and oil steam generating stations. Individual facilities compliance dates will vary based on circumstances and the determination by state regulators and may range to , except in certain circumstances when a facility will be retired by . DESC expects to complete wastewater treatment technology retrofits and modifications at the Williams generating station, with a similar project at the Wateree generation station under evaluation, to meet the requirements with the existing regulatory framework in South Carolina providing rate recovery mechanisms for costs of the projects. As discussed below, DESC recorded an increase to its AROs in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the expected compliance costs associated with the EPA s May 2024 final rule concerning CCR. DESC expects that such AROs would satisfy any AROs that would have otherwise been necessary for compliance with the EPA s May 2024 Effluent Limitations Guidelines. DESC is currently unable to estimate what costs, if any, may be required in addition to the project for the Williams generating station, a potential project at the Wateree generating station and the recorded AROs to meet the requirements to operate certain facilities past . However, DESC expects that while such costs for 

 22 

gallons per month must be permitted. The Cope Generating Station is located within this new Western Capacity Use Area. Cope has been using four deep groundwater wells for cooling water and other house loads since 1996. Prior to designation of the new Western Capacity Use Area, the wells at Cope Station were only required to be registered not permitted. As a result of this designation, Cope will need to restore the surface water equipment to operable status to reduce reliance on groundwater wells. This includes completion of 316(b) requirements, (including SCDHEC BACT determination and modification of the station national pollutant discharge elimination system permit) and extensive inspection, repair and/or replacement of the associated surface water withdrawal equipment which has been idle since 1996. While the impacts of this rule change are potentially material to DESC s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory framework in South Carolina provides rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts for DESC. Waste Management and Remediation The operations of DESC are subject to a variety of state and federal laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and release of hazardous substances associated with current and/or historical operations. The CERCLA, as amended, and similar state laws, may impose joint, several and strict liability for cleanup on potentially responsible parties who owned, operated or arranged for disposal at facilities affected by a release of hazardous substances. In addition, many states have created programs to incentivize voluntary remediation of sites where historical releases of hazardous substances are identified and property owners or responsible parties decide to initiate cleanups. From time to time, DESC may be identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the alleged release of hazardous substances or wastes at a site. Under applicable federal and state laws, DESC could be responsible for costs associated with the investigation or remediation of impacted sites, or subject to contribution claims by other responsible parties for their costs incurred at such sites. DESC also may identify, evaluate and remediate other potentially impacted sites under voluntary state programs. Remediation costs may be subject to reimbursement under DESC s insurance policies, rate recovery mechanisms, or both. Except as described below, DESC does not believe these matters will have a material effect on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. DESC has decommissioned manufactured gas plant sites in South Carolina that are in various states of investigation, remediation and monitoring under work plans approved by, or under review by, the SCDES or the EPA. In the fourth quarter of 2023, DESC completed the majority of remediation activities at one site. DESC anticipates the remaining activities at that site will be completed by 2025 at an estimated cost of less than million, after which the site will continue to incur ongoing maintenance and monitoring obligations. DESC expects to recover costs arising from the remediation work at all four sites through rate recovery mechanisms and as of September 30, 2024 , deferred amounts, net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled million and are included in regulatory assets. Ash Pond and Landfill Closure Costs In April 2015, the EPA enacted a final rule regulating CCR landfills, existing ash ponds that still receive and manage CCRs and inactive ash ponds that do not receive, but still store, CCRs. DESC currently has inactive and existing CCR ponds and CCR landfills subject to the final rule at different facilities. This rule created a legal obligation for DESC to retrofit or close all of its inactive and existing ash ponds over a certain period of time, as well as perform required monitoring, corrective action, and post-closure care activities as necessary. In December 2016, legislation was enacted that creates a framework for EPA-approved state CCR permit programs. In August 2017, the EPA issued interim guidance outlining the framework for state CCR program approval. The EPA has enforcement authority until state programs are approved. The EPA and states with approved programs both will have authority to enforce CCR requirements under their respective rules and programs. In September 2017, the EPA agreed to reconsider portions of the CCR rule in response to petitions for reconsideration. In March 2018, the EPA proposed certain changes to the CCR rule related to issues remanded as part of the pending litigation and other issues the EPA is reconsidering. Several of the proposed changes would allow states with approved CCR permit programs additional flexibility in implementing their programs. In July 2018, the EPA promulgated the first phase of changes to the CCR rule. In August 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its decision in the pending challenges of the CCR rule, vacating and remanding to the EPA three provisions of the rule. In May 2024, the EPA released a final rule to regulate inactive surface impoundments located at retired generating stations that contained CCR and liquids after October 2015, and certain other inactive or previously closed surface impoundments, landfills or other areas that contain accumulations of CCR. DESC believes that it may have inactive or closed units or areas that could be subject to the final rule at up to different stations. In connection with this rule, in the second quarter of 2024, DESC recorded an increase to its AROs of million, with a corresponding increase of million to property, plant and equipment for amounts recoverable for electric generation stations that 

 23 

million to regulatory assets for amounts recoverable through retail electric rates for electric generation stations that have been retired. In the third quarter of 2024, DESC recorded an adjustment to decrease the ARO and related property, plant and equipment by million to reflect updated information concerning facility. The actual AROs related to CCRs may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the obligation. Claims and Litigation The following describes certain legal proceedings involving DESC relating primarily to events occurring before closing of the SCANA Combination. Matters Fully Resolved Prior to 2024 Impacting the Consolidated Financial Statements Governmental Proceedings and Investigations In June 2018, DESC received a notice of proposed assessment of approximately million, excluding interest, from the SCDOR following its audit of DESC s sales and use tax returns for the periods September 1, 2008 through December 31, 2017. The proposed assessment, which includes of the NND Project, is based on the SCDOR s position that DESC s sales and use tax exemption for the NND Project does not apply because the facility will not become operational. In December 2020, the parties reached an agreement in principle in the amount of million to resolve this matter. In June 2021, the parties executed a settlement agreement which allows DESC to fund the settlement amount through a combination of cash, shares of Dominion Energy common stock or real estate with an initial payment of at least million in shares of Dominion Energy common stock. In August 2021, Dominion Energy issued million shares of its common stock to satisfy DESC s obligation for the initial payment under the settlement agreement. In May 2022, Dominion Energy issued an additional million shares of its common stock to partially satisfy DESC s remaining obligation under the settlement agreement. In June 2022, DESC requested approval from the South Carolina Commission to transfer certain real estate with a total settlement value of million to satisfy its remaining obligation under the settlement agreement. In July 2022, the South Carolina Commission voted to approve the request and issued its final order in August 2022. In September 2022, DESC transferred certain non-utility property with a fair value of million to the SCDOR under the settlement agreement. In December 2022, DESC transferred additional utility property with a fair value of million to the SCDOR. In October 2022, DESC filed for approval to transfer the remaining real estate with FERC which was received in November 2022. In March 2023, DESC transferred utility property with a fair value of million to the SCDOR resulting in a gain of million million after-tax), recorded in other income (expense), net in DESC s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In June 2023, DESC transferred the remaining utility property with a fair value of million to the SCDOR resulting in a gain of million million after-tax), recorded in other income (expense), net in DESC s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In July 2023, DESC made a less than million cash payment to the SCDOR to fully satisfy its remaining obligation, including applicable interest, under the settlement agreement. Nuclear Operations Other than the items discussed below, there have been no significant changes regarding DESC s nuclear insurance and spent nuclear fuel as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the DESC s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the total liability protection per nuclear incident available to all participants in the Secondary Financial Protection Program increased from billion to billion. This increase does not impact DESC s responsibility per active unit under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988. Additionally, Dominion Energy increased the amount of coverage purchased from commercial insurance pools for Summer from million to million with the remainder provided through the mandatory industry retrospective rating plan. Surety Bonds At September 30, 2024 , DESC had purchased million of surety bonds. Under the terms of surety bonds, DESC is obligated to indemnify the respective surety bond company for any amounts paid.

An analysis of DESC s results of operations follows: 
 Third Quarter 2024 vs. 2023 
 Operating revenues remained substantially consistent, primarily reflecting: 
 A 17 million increase in non-fuel base rates associated with the settlement of the electric base rate case; and 

An 8 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth. 

These increases were substantially offset by: 
 A 10 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers from a decrease in cooling degree days during the cooling season; 

A 7 million decrease due to one-time credits to customers associated with the electric base rate case; and 

A 6 million decrease in sales to electric utility customers associated with economic and other usage factors. 

Purchased power decreased 25 , primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with electric utility customers, which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income. 
 Other operations and maintenance increased 4 , primarily due to an increase in outside services 4 million) and an increase in salaries, wages and benefits and administrative expenses 3 million). 
 Impairment of assets and other charges increased 56 million, primarily due to a charge in connection with the electric base rate case primarily to write down certain materials and supplies inventory. 
 Other taxes increased 13 , primarily due to higher property taxes. 
 29 

Income tax expense decreased 91 , primarily due to lower pre-tax income 18 million) and a benefit associated with resolution of an uncertain tax position 14 million). 
 Year-To-Date 2024 vs. 2023 
 Operating revenues increased 2 , primarily reflecting: 
 A 42 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers from an increase in cooling degree days during the cooling season 29 million) and an increase in heating degree days during the heating season 13 million); 

A 21 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth; 

A 17 million increase in non-fuel base rates associated with the settlement of the electric base rate case; 

A 14 million increase in sales to gas utility customers associated with economic and other usage factors; and 

A 6 million increase in sales to gas utility customers associated with growth. 

These increases were partially offset by: 
 A 24 million decrease in sales to electric utility customers associated with economic and other usage factors; 

A 22 million net decrease in fuel-related revenue primarily as a result of a decrease in commodity costs and purchased power costs associated with sales to electric utility retail customers; 

An 8 million decrease in sales to electric retail customers from the capital cost rider; and 

A 7 million decrease due to one-time credits to customers associated with the electric base rate case. 

Purchased power decreased 17 , primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with electric utility customers, which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income. 
 Other operations and maintenance increased 9 , primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and benefits and administrative expenses 13 million), charges associated with various personal injury or wrongful death litigation cases 10 million), higher materials and supplies expense 10 million) and an increase in outside services 8 million). 
 Impairment of assets and other charges increased 60 million, primarily due to a charge in connection with the electric base rate case primarily to write down certain materials and supplies inventory. 
 Other income decreased 27 million, primarily due to the absences of gains on the transfer 20 million) and sales 11 million) of certain utility properties, partially offset by higher equity AFUDC 9 million). 
 Interest charges increased 9 , primarily due to an increase in the issuance of bonds in 2023 24 million), partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on intercompany borrowings 9 million). 
 Income tax expense decreased 47 , primarily due to lower pre-tax income.
