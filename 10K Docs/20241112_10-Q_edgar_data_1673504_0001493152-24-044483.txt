The
Company has been dormant since May 14, 2020. 

On
May 18, 2021, as a result of a receivership in Clark County, Nevada, Case Number: A-21-827642-F, David Lazar was appointed receiver of
the Company. Receiver David Lazar was granted the authority to rehabilitate the Company, including but not limited to the reinstatement
or revival of the Company s corporate charter with the Nevada Secretary of State, to prepare and file all documents as reasonably
necessary to comply with Rule 15c2-11 of the Securities Act of 1934, to collect the debts and property belonging to the Company, to compromise

A-21-827642-F, the claimants and creditors of the Company were barred from presenting claims and debts against the Company which arose
on or before the date of the Order. 

On
July 28, 2021 the Company designated shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a par value of . These shares were awarded
to Custodian Ventures managed by David Lazar in satisfaction of a judgement in the amount of 53,679.52 and for services performed for
the Company. The Series A Preferred Stock was valued at and was based on the current market pricing for a shell company of this
nature. 

On
December 22, 2021, a Stock Purchase Agreement was entered into between NYJJ (Hong Kong) Limited (the Seller and Atlantis
Glory Company Limited (the Purchaser ), whose controlling person is Ms. CHENG, Sau Heung, wherein the Purchaser purchased
 shares of Series A Preferred Shares, par value per share (the Shares ), of Shengshi Elevator International
Holding Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Company ). As a result, the Purchaser became an approximately holder

The consideration paid for the Shares was . The source of the cash consideration for the Shares was personal fund of the controlling
person of Purchaser. 

On
January 3, 2022, the sole officer and director of the Company, David Lazar, tendered his resignations as Director, President, Chief Executive
Officer, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Company, and appointed Ms. CHENG, Sau Heung as new President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary,

- in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has net loss of for the period ended September
30, 2024 and has negative working capital of and accumulated deficit of as of September 30, 2024. Losses have principally
occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for professional fees and general and administrative expenses associated with
our operations. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through December 31, 2024 is dependent upon the continued financial
support from its stockholders or external financing. Management believes the existing stockholders will provide the additional cash to
meet with the Company s obligations as they become due. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing
sufficient funds to sustain the operations. 

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. The Company may raise additional capital through the sale of
its equity securities, or through borrowings from financial institutions and related parties. Management believes that the actions presently
being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plan provides the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going
concern.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Organizational
History of the Company and Overview 

Plan
of Operation 

The
Company has no operations from a continuing business other than the expenditures related to running the Company and has no revenue from
continuing operations as of the date of this Report. 

Management
intends to explore and identify business opportunities, including a potential acquisition of an operating entity through a reverse merger,
asset purchase or similar transaction. Our ability to effectively identify, develop and implement a viable plan for our business may
be hindered by risks and uncertainties which are beyond our control, including without limitation, the continued negative effects of
the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. and global economies. For more information about the risk of coronavirus on our business, see Item
1A Risk Factors . 

We
do not currently engage in any business activities that provide revenue or cash flow. During the next 12-month period we anticipate incurring
costs in connection with investigating, evaluating, and negotiating potential business combinations, filing SEC reports, and consummating
an acquisition of an operating business. 

Given
our limited capital resources, we may consider a business combination with an entity which has recently commenced operations, is a developing
company or is otherwise in need of additional funds for the development of new products or services or expansion into new markets, or
is an established business experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. Alternatively, a business
combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, an entity which desires access to the U.S. capital markets. 

As
of the date of this Report, our management has not had any discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a potential
business combination. Any target business that is selected may be financially unstable or in the early stages of development. In such
event, we expect to be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or early-stage entity.
In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk or in which our
management has limited experience, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business,
there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. 

Our
management anticipates that we will likely only be able to effect one business combination due to our limited capital. This lack of diversification
will likely pose a substantial risk in investing in the Company for the indefinite future because it will not permit us to offset potential
losses from one venture or operating territory against gains from another. The risks we face will likely be heightened to the extent
we acquire a business operating in a single industry or geographical region. 

We
anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be a complex and risk-prone process. Because of general economic conditions,
including unfavorable conditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages
of available capital, management believes that there are a number of firms seeking business opportunities at this time at discounted
rates with which we will compete. We expect that any potentially available business combinations may appear in a variety of different
industries or regions and at various stages of development, all of which will likely render the task of comparative investigation and
analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complicated. Once we have developed and begun to implement our business
plan, management intends to fund our working capital requirements through a combination of our existing funds and future issuances of
debt or equity securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the implementation of a business plan
and commencement of operations. 

Based
upon our current operations, we do not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months. If we are able
to close a reverse merger, it is likely we will need capital as a condition of closing that acquisition. Because of the uncertainties,
we cannot be certain as to how much capital we need to raise or the type of securities we will be required to issue. In connection with
a reverse merger, we will be required to issue a controlling block of our securities to the target s shareholders which will be
very dilutive. 

11 

Additional
issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might
have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our Common Stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms,
or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective
new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

We
anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next 12 months, principally costs related to our being obligated to file reports
with the SEC. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in
their early stage of development. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model, recognition
of revenue sources, and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, develop, implement, and successfully
execute our business and marketing strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.

Comparison
of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues 

Revenues
were 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Operating
Expenses 

Our
general and administrative expenses decreased from 52,781 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 23,835 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was mainly attributed to the lower professional fee during the period. 

Net
Loss 

Our
net loss decreased from 52,781 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 23,835 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
The decrease was mainly attributed to the lower professional fee during the period. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Since
the inception of the Company, we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net losses of 23,835 and 52,781, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated
deficit of 1,090,563. As discussed in our financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these factors raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 0. To date, we have financed our operations principally through borrowings
from our related parties. Depending on our future operational results, we may need to conduct one or more equity or debt financings within
the next 12 months. 

We
could potentially need our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect, and we may incur additional indebtedness to
meet future financing needs. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, although
we anticipate being able to obtain additional financing through non-dilutive means, we may be unable to do so. Our failure to raise capital
as and when needed could have significant negative consequences for our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our
future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 27,865 and 44,331, respectively.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. 

Our
significant accounting policies are fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report, and we believe those accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation
of our financial statements.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified
in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer
or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
 assets; 

provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
 of our management and directors; and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the parameters set forth above and has
concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as a result of the following material weaknesses: 

The
 Company does not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions due to only having one officer and limited resources. 

The
 Company does not have an independent board of directors or an audit committee. 

The
 Company does not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. 

We
plan to rectify these weaknesses by implementing an independent board of directors, establishing written policies and procedures for
our internal control of financial reporting, and hiring additional accounting personnel at such time as we complete a reverse merger
or similar business acquisition. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

There
have been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
