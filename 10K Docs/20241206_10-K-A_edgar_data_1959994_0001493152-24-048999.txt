EXPLANATORY
NOTE 

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Shareholders
and Board of Directors 

 Australian
Oilseeds Holdings Ltd Brisbane, 

 Australia 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Australian Oilseeds Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries (the
 Company as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income
(loss), consolidated statement of changes of equity, and statement of cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30,
2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2024, in conformity with International
Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board and interpretations (collectively IFRS ). 

Restatement
to Correct Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the adjustments described in Note 2 that were applied to restate the 2023 consolidated financial statements which were previously
audited by another accounting firm to correct errors. In our opinion, these adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied.
Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2024.
