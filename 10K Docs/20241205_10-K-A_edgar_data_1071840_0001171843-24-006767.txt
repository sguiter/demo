EXPLANATORY NOTE 

This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (this Amendment amends
the Annual Report on Form 10-K of SolarWindow Technologies, Inc.. (the Company for the period ended August 31, 2024, originally
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on November 20, 2024 (the Original Form 10-K ). This
Amendment is being filed for the sole purpose of including disclosure under Item 1C, Cybersecurity. 

Except as otherwise expressly noted herein, this Amendment No. 1 does not
modify or update in any way the financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or other disclosure in, or exhibits to, the Original
Form 10-K, nor does it reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original Form 10-K. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 should be
read in conjunction with the Original Form 10-K. 

Pursuant to Rule 12b-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act ), this Amendment No. 1 also contains new certifications pursuant to Sections 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 31.1 and 32.1. Because no financial statements have been included in this Amendment
No. 1 and this Amendment No. 1 does not contain or amend any disclosure with respect to Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the certifications have been omitted. 

Item 1C. CYBERSECURITY 

As of the date of this Annual
Report, we believe that we have limited risks associated with a breach in cybersecurity. Risks from cybersecurity threats, including as
a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents (of which we are not aware of any), have not materially affected or are not reasonably
likely to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. 

Risk management and strategy. 

We have not established specific
processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats or engaged third parties to assess such risks.
However, if exposed to such a risk, we would assess any potential unauthorized attempts to access our information systems that may result
in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of those systems. 

While we lack a formal risk assessment
policy or analysis and no process has been integrated into our management system, a risk assessment would likely include identification
of any reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks, any likelihood and potential damage that could result from such risks, and
whether existing safeguards are sufficient to manage such risks. If appropriate and necessary, we would implement reasonable safeguards
to minimize identified risks and address any identified gaps in existing systems. 

Primary responsibility for assessing
any cybersecurity risks rests with our management, who would report any threat to our board of directors. 

To date, we have not encountered
cybersecurity threats or challenges that have materially impaired our operations, business strategy or financial condition.
