 Credit Facility

In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an annual fee equal to of the amount of the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility if amounts borrowed are greater than of the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility and of the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility if amounts borrowed are less than or equal to of the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The deferral and restriction period limitations were effective beginning January 1, 2024 for salary and other compensation deferrals and are now effective for performance periods commencing on and after July 1, 2024 for cash bonus deferrals. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units 
 The Plan, and previous 2014 Plan, provide for the award of restricted stock units ("RSUs"). The Company historically granted long-term incentive awards to its executive officers which was comprised of restricted stock that vested in years, based on backward-looking performance metrics. On January 2, 2024, the Board approved and adopted a new incentive compensation structure for its executive officers, including the issuance of time-based and performance-based RSUs with forward-looking performance targets beginning with an initial performance period beginning July 1, 2023. 
 
 On January 2, 2024, the Company granted performance-based and time-based RSUs to its executive officers under the 2014 Incentive Plan and the Third Amended and Restated Executive Officer Incentive Program. These RSUs with a grant date value totaling million are forward-looking with a performance period beginning July 1, 2023. The performance-based RSUs were valued by independent specialists utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the weighted average grant date fair values of per share for the Absolute TSR units and per share for the Relative TSR units. The grant date fair value of the Time-based TSR units was based on the Company's stock price on the grant date of . The combined weighted average grant date fair value of the RSUs granted was per share.

 million and million, respectively, secured by all assets and ownership interests in long-term acute care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation hospital owned by the borrower. The term loan will be repaid in equal monthly installments of through the maturity date of December 31, 2025 and bears interest at per annum. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, notes receivable included a term loan totaling million, and a revolving credit facility with million and million drawn, respectively, secured by assets and ownership interests of geriatric behavioral hospitals and affiliated companies all of which are co-borrowers on the loans. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an unfunded commitment of million on the revolving credit facility and an unfunded commitment of up to million on an advancing term loan facility. The term loan bears interest at per annum, with interest only payments due initially and then equal monthly installments of principal payments due beginning March 31, 2025. The term loan facility matures on December 31, 2032. The revolving credit facility bears interest at per annum and matures on December 31, 2025. The advancing term loan may be funded at the Company's discretion, and bears interest at per annum on any amount funded, that may be used by the borrower to pay existing liabilities of co-borrowers. The term loan, the revolving credit facility and the additional commitment all include a per annum non-cash interest charge that is due and payable upon the earlier of the repayment or maturity of each note. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the collectability of the term loan and revolver loan was not reasonably assured. The tenant/borrower has experienced challenges with patient census and employee staffing, which has impacted cash flows from operations and the consistency of rent and interest payments to the Company. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company valued the notes based on its estimated value of the underlying collateral. As a result, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded an million credit loss reserve on its notes receivable with the tenant and reversed approximately million of interest and placed the notes on non-accrual status. Changes in cash flows of the business, changes in market data, such as market multiples, and other relevant data may drive a change in the estimated value of the underlying collateral. At September 30, 2024, however, the Company did not believe that there were any material changes to warrant a change in the credit loss reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, notes receivable also included a million and million, respectively, revolving credit fac ility. This note will be repaid in equal monthly installments of beginning on November 1, 2024, through the maturity date of April 1, 2027. The revolving credit facility bears interest at per annum, as well as a per annum non-cash interest charge that is due and payable upon the earlier of the repayment or maturity of the note. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , notes receivable also included a million construction mortgage loan with a developer which is secured by the land, improvements, and personal property. The mortgage loan, which bears interest at per annum, will be interest only until the principal is due at the earlier of the completion and acquisition of the property, or August 15, 2027. 
 
 The Company identified the borrowers of these notes as variable interest entities ("VIEs"), but management determined that the Company was not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs because we lack either directly or through related parties any material decision-making rights or control of the entities that impact the borrowers' economic performance. We are not obligated to provide support beyond our stated commitment to the borrowers, and accordingly our maximum exposure to loss as a result of this relationship is limited to the amount of our outstanding notes receivable.

In addition, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility prior to the second Amendment will remain outstanding. Interest rate swaps previously entered into to fix the interest rates on the A-3 Term Loan will remain in place on the Revolving Credit Facility through their maturity on March 29, 2026.

 Overview 
 References such as "we," "us," "our," and "the Company" mean Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated, a Maryland corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 We were organized in the State of Maryland on March 28, 2014. We are a self-administered, self-managed healthcare real estate investment trust, or REIT, that acquires and owns properties that are leased to hospitals, doctors, healthcare systems or other healthcare service providers. 

Trends and Matters Impacting Operating Results 
 Management monitors factors and trends that it believes are important to the Company and the REIT industry in order to gauge their potential impact on the operations of the Company. Certain of the factors and trends that management believes may impact the operations of the Company are discussed below. 
 26 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Continued 

 Real Estate Acquisitions 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the Company acquired six real estate properties totaling approximately 223,000 square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 63.9 million and cash consideration of approximately 64.2 million. Upon acquisition, the properties were 99.3 leased in the aggregate with lease expirations through 2039. These acquisitions were funded with net proceeds from equity sales through the ATM program and the Company's Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 4 Real Estate Acquisitions, Disposition, and Assets Held for Sale to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on these acquisitions. 
 
 Real Estate Dispositions 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company disposed of an 11,200 square foot surgical center in Texas, received net proceeds of approximately 1.0 million, and recognized an immaterial gain on sale. 
 
 Acquisition Pipeline 
 The Company has four properties under definitive purchase agreements for an aggregate expected purchase price of approximately 8.8 million. The Company's expected returns on these investments range from 9.29 to 9.50 . The Company expects to close on these properties in the fourth quarter of 2024; however, the Company cannot provide assurance as to the timing of when, or whether, these transactions will actually close. The Company expects to fund these acquisitions with proceeds from the Company's Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 The Company has seven properties under definitive purchase agreements, to be acquired after completion and occupancy, for an aggregate expected purchase price of approximately 169.5 million. The Company's expected return on these investments will approximate 9.1 to 9.75 . The Company anticipates closing on these properties throughout 2025, 2026 and 2027; however, the Company cannot provide assurance as to the timing of when, or whether, these transactions will actually close. 
 
 Leased Square Footage 
 As of September 30, 2024, our real estate portfolio was approximately 91.3 leased, excluding real estate properties held for sale. During the first nine months of 2024, we had expiring or terminated leases related to approximately 431,000 square feet, and we leased or renewed leases relating to approximately 427,000 square feet. 
 
 Purchase Option Provisions 
 Certain of the Company's leases provide the lessee with a purchase option or a right of first refusal to purchase the leased property. The purchase option provisions generally allow the lessee to purchase the leased property at fair value or at an amount greater than the Company's gross investment in the leased property at the time of the purchase. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had an aggregate gross investment of approximately 32.9 million in 10 real estate properties with purchase options exercisable at September 30, 2024 that had not been exercised. 
 
 Inflation 
 Periods of high and persistent inflation could cause an increase in our expenses, capital expenditures, and cost of our variable-rate borrowings which could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Many of our lease agreements contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation, including annual rent increases based on stated increases or CPI increases. In response to inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in 2022. Though these higher interest rates have just begun to decline, these higher rates may adversely impact real estate asset values and increase our interest expense on our variable-rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
 
 Executive Compensation 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company's Board approved and adopted certain changes to executive compensation. Through the adoption of the Third Amended and Restated Alignment of Interest Program, the Board established a maximum elective deferral percentage amount of 50 (previously 100 of compensation allowed to be deferred and applied to the acquisition of restricted stock for certain participants in the program, and limited the 
 27 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Continued 

 duration of the restriction period election depending on each individual's retirement eligibility date. These changes were effective beginning January 1, 2024 for salary and other compensation deferrals and are now effective beginning July 1, 2024 for cash bonus deferrals. 
 
 Further, the Board approved and adopted a new long-term incentive compensation structure for its executive officers, which includes the issuance of time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs with three-year forward-looking performance targets. Historically, the Company had granted long-term incentive awards to its executive officers comprised of restricted stock that vested in eight years, based on backward-looking performance metrics. See Note 9 Stock Incentive Plan for more details. 

Results of Operations 
 The Company's results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 were impacted by real estate acquisitions, lease receivable, interest and loan loss reserves recognized in the second quarter of 2024 related to a tenant, the amortization of non-cash compensation, including the accelerated amortization of unvested restricted shares upon the passing of the Company's former CEO and President in the first quarter of 2023, the new executive compensation program implemented in the first quarter of 2024, as well as other items discussed in more detail below.

 28 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Continued 

Other operating interest decreased approximately 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due mainly to placing a tenant note on non-accrual and reversing interest due from that tenant, as well as a reduction in interest on notes due to reduced principal balances from payments received. 
 
 Expenses 
 Property operating expenses increased approximately 0.5 million, or 9.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due mainly to additional expenses on properties acquired during 2023 and 2024. 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased approximately 1.3 million, or 36.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due mainly to compensation-related expenses. The non-cash amortization of deferred compensation increased approximately 0.6 million and cash compensation increased approximately 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the issuance of additional restricted shares and from the impact of adopting the new executive compensation program in January 2024 which included the grant of 3-year forward-looking restricted stock units, as well as limiting the maximum elective deferral percentage amount of salary and bonus to 50 (previously 100 as described in more detail in Note 9 Stock Incentive Plan to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization e xpense decreased approximately 0.3 million, or 2.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 . This decrease was due mainly to the following: 
 Fully amortized real estate lease intangibles which generally have a shorter depreciable life than a building resulted in a decrease of approximately 1.9 million; 
 Depreciation and amortization on the two properties classified as held for sale during the second and fourth quarters of 2023 resulted in a decrease of approximately 1.3 million; 
 Accelerated amortization of lease intangibles on the two GenesisCare properties where the leases were rejected resulted in a decrease of approximately 1.5 million; 
 Depreciation and amortization on re al estate acquired during 2023 and 2024 resulted in an increase of approximately 1.3 million; and 
 Depreciation on tenant and other capital improvements resulted in an increase of approximately 3.2 million . 
 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased approximately 1.6 million, or 34.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due mainly to increases in the weighted average balance and interest rates on the revolving credit facility. 
 
 Deferred income tax expense 
 Deferred income tax expense decreased approximately 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an additional valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset. 
 
 Interest and other income, net 
 Interest and other income, net increased approximately 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received earnest money on a terminated contract on a property held for sale.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Continued 

 General and administrative expenses decreased approximately 9.4 million, or 39.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due mainly to the following: 
 
 Non-cash accelerated amortization of deferred compensation in the first quarter of 2023 for non-vested restricted common shares held by former CEO and President Timothy Wallace at the time of his passing in March 2023 accounted for a decrease of approximately 11.8 million; offset partially by 
 An increase in the non-cash amortization of other deferred compensation of approximately 1.3 million and cash compensation of approximately 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the issuance of additional restricted shares and from the impact of adopting the new executive compensation program in January 2024 which included the grant of 3-year forward-looking restricted stock units, as well as limiting the maximum elective deferral percentage amount of salary and bonus to 50 (previously 100 as described in more detail in Note 9 Stock Incentive Plan to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Management considers certain non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators to be useful supplemental measures of the Company's operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable measure determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company reports non-GAAP financial measures because these measures are observed by management to also be among the most predominant measures used by the REIT industry and by industry analysts to evaluate REITs. For these reasons, management deems it appropriate to disclose and discuss these non-GAAP financial measures. Set forth below are descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures management considers relevant to the Company's business and useful to investors, as well as reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 
 The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators presented herein are not necessarily identical to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income, as indicators of the Company's financial performance, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as measures of the Company's liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. Management believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company's historical consolidated operating results, these measures should be examined in conjunction with net income and cash flows from operations as presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Funds from Operations ("FFO") and Adjusted Funds from Operations ("AFFO") 
 FFO is an operating performance measure adopted by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. NAREIT ). NAREIT defines FFO as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a REIT s operating performance equal to net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate properties, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. NAREIT also provides REITs with an option to exclude gains, losses and impairments of assets that are incidental to the main business of the REIT from the calculation of FFO. 
 
 In addition to FFO, the Company presents AFFO and AFFO per share. The Company defines AFFO as FFO, excluding certain expenses related to closing costs of properties acquired accounted for as business combinations and mortgages funded, excluding straight-line rent and the amortization of stock-based compensation, and including or excluding other non-cash items from time to time. AFFO presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. 
 
 Management believes that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, management believes FFO, AFFO, FFO per share and AFFO per share provide an understanding of the operating performance of the Company s properties without giving effect to certain significant non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization expense. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. The Company believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization, impairments and gains or losses from sales of real estate, losses and impairment of incidental assets, all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO, AFFO, FFO per share and AFFO per share can facilitate comparisons of operating

 (2) During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized a 0.7 million net casualty gain from insurance proceeds received related to one property. The Company recorded impairments on the property in previous quarters based on contracts to sell, and sold the property during the three months ended September 30, 2024, recording an immaterial gain on sale. 
 (3) During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company accelerated the amortization of stock-based compensation totaling 11.8 million upon the passing of our former CEO and President. 
 (4) During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded an 11.0 million credit loss reserve related to notes receivable that are incidental to the Company's main business with a geriatric inpatient behavioral hospital tenant. 
 (5) Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for FFO and AFFO are calculated based on the treasury method, rather than the 2-class method used to calculate earnings per share. 
 
 Net Operating Income ("NOI") 
 NOI is a key performance indicator. NOI is defined as net income or loss, computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from our total portfolio of properties and other investments before general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, gains or loss on the sale of real estate properties or other investments, interest expense, and income tax expense. We believe that NOI provides an accurate measure of operating performance of our operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with management of the properties. The Company's use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing NOI.

EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re 
 The Company uses the NAREIT definition of EBITDA re which is net income or loss plus interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization, plus losses or minus gains on the disposition of depreciable property, including losses/gains on change of control, plus impairment write-downs of depreciable property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciable property in the affiliate, plus or minus adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDA re of unconsolidated affiliates and consolidated affiliates with non-controlling interest. The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA re which is EBITDA re before non-cash stock-based compensation expense. 
 
 We consider EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re important measures because they provide additional information to allow management, investors, and our current and potential creditors to evaluate and compare our core operating results and our ability to service debt.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company monitors its liquidity and capital resources and relies on several key indicators in its assessment of capital markets for financing acquisitions and other operating activities as needed, including the following: 
 
 Leverage ratios and financial covenants included in our Credit Facility; 
 
 Dividend payout percentage; and 
 
 Interest rates, underlying treasury rates, debt market spreads and equity markets. 
 
 The Company uses these indicators and others to compare its operations to its peers and to help identify areas in which the Company may need to focus its attention. 
 
 Financing Policy 
 The Company s current financing policy limits aggregate debt (secured or unsecured) in excess of 40 of the Company's total capitalization, except for short-term, transitory periods. At September 30, 2024, our debt to total capitalization ratio (debt plus stockholders' equity plus accumulated depreciation) was approximately 40.0 . 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 The Company derives most of its revenues from its real estate properties. Our rental income represents our primary source of liquidity to fund our dividends, general and administrative expenses, property operating expenses, capital improvements on our properties, interest expense on our Credit Facility, and other expenses incurred related to managing our existing portfolio. To the extent additional resources are needed, the Company will fund its investment activity generally through equity or debt issuances either in the public or private markets or through proceeds from our Credit Facility, which was amended in October 2024 to provide additional financing for 
 35 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Continued 

 acquisitions, capital improvements and other cash needs. See Note 14 Subsequent Events to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The Company expects to meet its liquidity needs through cash on hand, cash flows from operations and cash flows from sources discussed above. The Company believes that its liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy its cash requirements. The Company cannot, however, be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to the Company in sufficient amounts to meet its liquidity needs. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 On October 16, 2024, the Company amended its Credit Facility to increase the Revolving Credit Facility capacity from 150.0 million to 400.0 million and extend the maturity through October 16, 2029. The amended Credit Facility also lowered pricing on the Revolving Credit Facility by 10 to 30 basis points, depending on the Company's leverage ratio. Proceeds from the increased Revolving Credit Facility were used to repay the existing 75.0 million A-3 Term Loan which was scheduled to mature on March 29, 2026. In addition, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility prior to this amendment will remain outstanding. Interest rate swaps previously entered into to fix the interest rates on the A-3 Term Loan will remain in place on the Revolving Credit Facility through their maturity on March 29, 2026. See Note 5 Debt, net and Note 14 Subsequent Events to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements which provide more details on the Company's Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024, prior to the amendment, the Company had borrowing capacity remaining under the Revolving Credit Facility of approximately 25.0 million. At the time of closing on the amendment, on October 16, 2024, the Company had borrowing capacity remaining under the Revolving Credit Facility of approximately 198.0 million. 
 
 The Company s ability to borrow under the Credit Facility is subject to its ongoing compliance with a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations with respect to liens, indebtedness, distributions, mergers, consolidations, investments, restricted payments and asset sales, as well as financial maintenance covenants. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under its Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Ground Leases 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company was obligated, as the lessee, under four non-prepaid ground leases accounted for as operating leases with expiration dates, including renewal options, through 2076, and two non-prepaid ground leases accounted for as financing leases with expiration dates through 2109, including renewal options. Any rental increases related to the Company's ground leases are generally either stated or based on the Consumer Price Index. At September 30, 2024, the Company's aggregate obligation under these ground leases was approximately 8.7 million. See Note 3 Real Estate Leases to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Acquisition Pipeline 
 The Company has four properties under definitive purchase agreements for an aggregate expected purchase price of approximately 8.8 million. The Company's expected returns on these investments range from 9.29 to 9.50 . The Company expects to close on these properties in the fourth quarter of 2024; however, the Company cannot provide assurance as to the timing of when, or whether, these transactions will actually close. The Company expects to fund these acquisitions with proceeds from the Company's Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 The Company has seven properties under definitive purchase agreements, to be acquired after completion and occupancy, for an aggregate expected purchase price of approximately 169.5 million. The Company anticipates closing on these properties throughout 2025, 2026 and 20 27 ; however, the Company cannot provide assurance as to the timing of when, or whether, these transactions will actually close. The Company expects to fund these acquisitions through net proceeds from equity sales through the ATM program and the Company's Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Tenant Improvements and Capital Improvements 
 Subject to Company approval, we may fund or reimburse tenants for tenant improvements, which are allowed for in certain leases, of up to approximately 26.0 million as of September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, six of these 
 36 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Continued 

 projects, totaling 13.1 million, represented redevelopment projects on buildings with tenants backed by long-term leases. 
 
 The Company has also entered into contracts regarding certain capital expenditures with remaining commitments totaling approximately 3.1 million as of September 30, 2024. Six of these projects totaling 0.8 million, represent redevelopment projects of the buildings into different healthcare uses backed by long-term leases. Reimbursement of these expenditures by our tenants will be determined by each tenant's lease. 
 
 The Company expects to fund these expenditures through the Company's free cash flow, proceeds from equity sales through the ATM program, and the Company's Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Notes Receivable 
 The Company has two notes with a tenant with unfunded commitments remaining totaling 4.2 million at September 30, 2024. See Note 10 Other Assets, net to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Automatic Shelf Registration Statement 
 On November 2, 2022, the Company filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration statement is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this registration statement, the Company has the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, depository shares, rights, debt securities, warrants and units. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 43.2 million and 47.1 million, respectively. Cash flows provided by operating activities were generally provided by contractual rents and interest on our notes receivable, net of property operating expenses not reimbursed by the tenants and general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 83.2 million and 100.1 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company invested in six properties for an aggregate cash consideration of approximately 64.2 million and sold a property for cash consideration of approximately 1.0 million. Also, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company funded notes totaling 2.9 million, received payments on its notes totaling 2.4 million and funded capital expenditures on its existing portfolio totaling approximately 19.5 million. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company invested in 17 properties and one land parcel for an aggregate cash consideration of approximately 92.0 million and funded notes receivable totaling approximately 2.0 million. Also, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received payments on its notes receivable totaling 3.0 million, received insurance proceeds from a casualty loss totaling 2.3 million, and funded capital expenditures on its existing portfolio totaling approximately 11.5 million. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 38.2 million and 45.9 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company (i) borrowed 75.0 million under its Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) repaid a mortgage note totaling approximately 4.8 million, (iii) paid dividends totaling approximately 38.6 million, (iv) completed equity offerings under its at-the-market program, resulting in net proceeds, net of underwriters' discount and offering costs, of approximately 7.3 million, and (v) upon the vesting of stock-based awards for certain employees, withheld shares and paid taxes totaling approximately 0.8 million on behalf of the employees.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Continued 

 underwriters' discount and offering costs, of approximately 34.6 million, (iii) upon the vesting of stock-based awards for certain employees, withheld shares and paid taxes totaling approximately 1.0 million on behalf of employees, and (iv) paid dividends totaling approximately 35.6 million. 
 
 Security Deposits 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company held approximately 2.9 million in security deposits for the benefit of the Company in the event the obligated tenant fails to perform under the terms of its respective lease. Generally, the Company may, at its discretion and upon notification to the tenant, draw upon the security deposits if there are any defaults under the leases. 
 
 Dividends 
 The Company is required to pay dividends to its stockholders at least equal to 90 of its taxable income in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT. 
 
 On October 24, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend in the amount of 0.465 per share. The dividend is payable on November 22, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 8, 2024. This rate equates to an annualized dividend of 1.86 per share. 
 
 The ability of the Company to pay dividends is dependent upon its ability to generate cash flows and to make accretive new investments. 

Corporate Responsibility 
 The Company is committed to conducting its business according to the highest ethical standards and upholding its corporate responsibilities as a public company operating for the benefit of its stockholders. To that end, the Company modified its Governance Committee to be the Environmental, Social, and Governance ESG Committee with a revised charter included on the Company s website at www.chct.reit. Among other duties, the ESG Committee meets at least annually to review and recommend to the Board the general strategy and initiatives regarding ESG matters, including the Company s internal and external communications and disclosures. 
 
 The Company s Board of Directors has adopted a revised Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that not only applies to its directors, officers, and other employees but also extends the Company's expectations that its vendors, service providers, contractors, and consultants will embrace the Company's commitment to integrity and personal responsibility by complying with this Code at all times. The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct includes the Company s commitment to promote high standards of integrity by conducting its affairs honestly and ethically and to include in its periodic reports or other publicly available documents information and metrics related to internal monitoring, whistleblower, or reporting systems. 
 
 The Company s whistleblower policy prohibits the Company and its affiliates and their officers, employees and agents from discharging, demoting, suspending, threatening, harassing or in any other manner discriminating against any employee for raising a concern. If an employee desires to raise a concern in a confidential or anonymous manner, the concern may be directed to the whistleblower officer at the Company s whistleblower hotline. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the whistleblower officer received no whistleblower complaints. 
 
 The Company s Information Technology infrastructure is cloud-based, utilizing Software as a Service SaaS applications for substantially all of its software requirements. Management has formed an IT Committee consisting of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and the Vice President of Information Technology to review and discuss information security matters and cyber security risks. The committee meets at least twice a year and reports to the Board of Directors as needed. The Company has adopted the Center of Internet Security (CIS) v8 IG1 cyber security controls including adopting an annual information security training program for its employees. The Company has partnered with a global cyber security leader to continuously and proactively manage and mitigate the ever growing list of cyber threats. As part of the managed monitoring and remediation platform, the Company benefits from a 100,000 breach prevention warranty. Since its inception, the Company has not had a security breach, and has not incurred any resulting expenses, penalties or settlements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We may use certain derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings. We will not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit rating and other factors. An interest rate swap is a contractual agreement entered into by two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic payments to the other for an agreed period of time based on a notional amount of principal. Under the most common form of interest rate swap, known from our perspective as a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap, a series of floating, or variable, rate payments on a notional amount of principal is exchanged for a series of fixed interest rate payments on such notional amount. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks presented in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
