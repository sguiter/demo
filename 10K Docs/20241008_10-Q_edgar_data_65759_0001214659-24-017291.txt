 NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

The Company s revenues are from
purchase orders and/or contracts with customers associated with manufacture of products. We account for a contract when it has approval
and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial
substance and collectability of consideration is probable. 

2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 

The majority of the Company s
purchase orders or contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, the shipment of products. 

3. Determine the transaction price. 

The transaction price reflects the
Company s expectations about the consideration it will be entitled to receive from the customer at a fixed price per unit shipped
based on the terms of the contract or purchase order with the customer. To the extent our actual costs vary from the fixed price that
was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. 

4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 

The Company s transaction price
is the fixed price per unit per each delivery upon shipment. 

5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. 

This performance obligation is satisfied
when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment or delivery. The Company receives purchase orders
for products to be delivered over multiple dates that may extend across reporting periods. The Company accounting policy treats shipping
and handling activities as a fulfillment cost. The Company invoices for each delivery upon shipment and recognizes revenues at the fixed
price for each distinct product delivered when transfer of control has occurred, which is generally upon shipment. 

For certain contracts under which the
Company produces products with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment during the production
cycle, the Company recognizes revenue for the cost incurred of work in process plus a margin at the end of each period and records a contract
asset (unbilled receivable). The majority of these products are shipped weekly and monthly to the customers and the contracts require
us to manage and limit the level of work in process to meet the scheduled delivery dates. 

In addition, the Company may have a
contract or purchase order to provide a non-recurring engineering service to a customer. These contracts are reviewed, and performance
obligations are determined and we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.

The Company assesses long-lived assets for impairment
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) ASC 360-10-35, Property, Plant
and Equipment Subsequent Measurement . When events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, an assessment is
performed. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s net book value to
determine if a write down to market value less cost to sell is required. 

Construction in progress relates to multiple capital
projects ongoing during the year ended November 30, 2023 and the nine months ended August 24, 2024. 

Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Improvements which extend the useful lives of property, plant, and equipment are capitalized.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Business 

Micropac Industries, Inc. (the Company ),
a Delaware corporation, designs, manufactures and distributes various types of microelectronic circuits including solid state relays and
power controllers, optoelectronic components, and sensor and display components and assemblies. The Company s products are used
as components and assemblies in a broad range of military, space and industrial systems, including aircraft instrumentation and navigation
systems, satellite systems, power supplies, electronic controls, computers, medical devices, and high-temperature (200 o C)
products. 

The Company s facilities are certified and
qualified by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to MIL-PRF-38534 (class K-space level) and MIL-PRF-19500 JANS (space level) and are certified
to ISO 9001:2008 and AS 9100D. Micropac is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) core supplier, and is registered to
AS9100-Aerospace Industry standard for supplier certification. The Company has Underwriters Laboratories (UL) approval on our industrial
power controllers. 

The Company s core technology are microelectronic
and optoelectronic designs to include the packaging and interconnecting of multi-chip microelectronics modules. Other technologies include
light emitting and light sensitive materials and products, including light emitting diodes and silicon phototransistors, and electronic
integration used in the Company s optoelectronic components and assemblies. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circustances. Note 2 to the Financial Statements
in the Quarterly Report Form 10-Q for the quarter ended August 24, 2024, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used
in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

The core principle of revenue recognition
under accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America (GAAP) is that the Company should recognize revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company s revenue on the majority of its customer contracts are recognized
at a point in time, generally upon shipment of products. The application of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue
requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, the determination of whether revenues related to our revenue contracts should
be recognized over time or at a point in time, as these determinations impact the timing and amount of our reported revenues and net income.
Other significant judgments include the estimation of the point in the manufacturing process at which we are entitled to receive payment,
as well as the progress of the job order to completion in order to determine the amount of consideration earned for contractual revenue
recognized over time. 

The allowance for credit losses is based on our
assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable. If there is a deterioration of
a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability
of amounts due us could be adversely affected. 

Inventory purchases and commitments are based
upon future demand. If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence
because of changing customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margin could be adversely
affected. 

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and
liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and
laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. If we were to determine we would not be able
to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be necessary which would
reduce our net income for that period. 

Depreciable and useful lives estimated for property and equipment are
based on initial expectations of the period of time these assets will provide benefit. Changes in circumstances related to a change in
our business or other factors could result in these assets becoming impaired, which could adversely affect the value of these assets

a combination of cash and a commercial real estate construction loan for the construction of a new 76,000 square foot manufacturing center
on the 9.2 acres of land in Garland, Texas the Company purchased. On March 26, 2021, the Company (acting as borrower) entered into a Construction
Loan Agreement with Frost Bank Frost ), (acting as lender). The Construction Loan Agreement provides for a construction
loan as discussed in Note 5 to the condensed financial statements.
