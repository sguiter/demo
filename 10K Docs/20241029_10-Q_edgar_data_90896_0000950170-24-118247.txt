 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States U.S. and manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company s retail operations consist of sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers across the U.S. The Company's construction services business provides installation and set-up services of factory-built homes. The Company s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. 
 million and million at September 28, 2024 and March 30, 2024, respectively. Floor plan receivables consist primarily of amounts loaned by the Company through Triad Financial Services, Inc. ("Triad") to certain independent retailers for purchases of homes manufactured by the Company, of which million and million was outstanding at September 28, 2024 and March 30, 2024, respectively. Floor plan receivables are carried net of payments received and recorded at amortized cost. The Company intends to hold the floor plan receivables until maturity or payoff. These loans are serviced by Triad, to which we pay a servicing fee. Upon execution of the financing arrangement, the floor plan loans are generally payable at the earlier of the sale of the underlying home or two years from the origination date. Floor plan receivables are included in other current assets and other noncurrent assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The floor plan receivables are collateralized by the related homes, mitigating loss exposure. The Company and Triad evaluate the credit worthiness of each independent retailer prior to credit approval, including reviewing the independent retailer s payment history, financial condition, and the overall economic environment. The Company evaluates the risk of credit loss in aggregate on existing loans with similar terms, based on historic experience and current economic conditions, as well as individual retailers with past due balances or other indications of heightened credit risk. The allowance for credit losses related to floor plan receivables was not material as of September 28, 2024 or March 30, 2024. Loans are considered past due if any required interest or curtailment payment remains unpaid 30 days after the due date. Receivables are placed on non-performing status if any interest or installment payments are past due over 90 days. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when interest payments are past due over 90 days. At September 28, 2024, there were floor plan receivables on nonaccrual status and the weighted-average age of the floor plan receivables was six months.

, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Regional Enterprises, LLC and related companies (collectively, "Regional Homes") for total purchase consideration of million, net of assumed indebtedness and working capital adjustments. The purchase consideration consisted of net cash of million, the issuance of shares of common stock equal to approximately million, and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of million. The contingent consideration is related to an earnout provision in the event certain conditions are met per the terms of the purchase agreement, with a maximum earnout amount of million. The initial fair value of the earnout was established using a Monte Carlo simulation method and the resulting liability is recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the method and timing of measuring the earnout was amended, which resulted in a charge of million which is reflected in selling, general, and administrative expense in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Income Statements. The C ompany accounted for the acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting provided by FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"). As such, the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired, inclusive of intangible assets, with the excess fair value recorded to goodwill. The purchase price allocation is based upon preliminary valuation information available to determine the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, including goodwill, and is subject to change as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at the valuation date. The Company expects to finalize the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the one-year measurement period.

Retail inventories are reflected at manufacturer wholesale prices. Intangible assets include million in customer relationships and million in trade names and are based on an independent appraisal. The fair value of customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method and fair value of the trade name was determined using the relief-from-royalty method. The Company estimated that each intangible asset has a weighted average useful life of from the acquisition date. Fair value estimates of property, plant, and equipment were based on independent appraisals, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the appraisals were drawn from a combination of market, cost, and sales comparison approaches, as appropriate. Level 3 fair value estimates of million related to property, plant, and equipment and million related to intangible assets were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date. For further information on acquired assets measured at fair value, see Note 5, Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Cloud Computing Arrangements. The acquisition of Regional Hom es was a taxable business combination. Therefore, the Company s tax basis in the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed approximate the respective fair values at the acquisition date.

 million at September 28, 2024 and million at March 30, 2024, respectively. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of September 28, 2024 was estimated to be million . Losses incurred on homes repurchased were immaterial during the three and six months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. At September 28, 2024, the Company was contingently obliga ted for million under letters of credit, consisting of million to support long-term debt , million to support the casualty insurance program, an d million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated f or million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Product Liability - Water Intrusion The Company has received consumer complaints for damages related to water intrusion in homes built in one of its manufacturing facilities prior to fiscal 2022. The Company has investigated, and believes, the cause of the damage is the result of materials that did not perform in accordance with the manufacturer's contractual obligations. The Company has identified certain homes constructed over that period that may be affected. Based on the results of ongoing investigation and repair efforts, the Company has developed and HUD has approved a remediation plan under Subpart I of the HUD code. The plan calls for inspection and repair of affected homes if there is evidence of damage, or procedures to mitigate the opportunity for future damage. As a result of the proposal, the Company recorded charges to execute the remediation plan of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company estimated the charges by establishing a range of total expected costs determined by an actuary using a Monte Carlo simulation. The analysis resulted in a range of losses between mi llion and m illion. The Company was not able to determine a value in the range that was more likely than any other value, and as prescribed by U.S. GAAP, recorded the charge for remediation based on the low end of the range of potential losses. The Company is monitoring the results of the inspection and repair activities, and may revise the amount of the estimated liability, which could result in an increase or decrease in the estimated liability in future periods. The liability is included in other current liabilities in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Based on the Company's investigation into the cause of the water intrusion, including third-party testing of the material at issue, the Company believes it is possible that it will recover some or all of the estimated remediation costs. The Company will attempt to recover those costs from the manufacturer of the material, the distributor of the material, their related insurance providers or from the Company's insurance providers. However, the Company is unable to record an offset for any estimated costs at this time in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Item 2. 	 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following should be read in conjunction with Champion Homes, Inc. s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Report. 
 Overview 
 Champion Homes, Inc., formerly known as Skyline Champion Corporation (the Company ), is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including factory-built home manufacturing, company-owned retail locations, construction services, and transportation logistics services. The Company markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Champion Homes, Genesis Homes, Skyline Homes, Regional Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 43 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company s retail operations consist of 72 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers across the U.S. The Company s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. 
 Acquisitions and Expansions 
 The Company is focused on operational improvements to increase capacity utilization and profitability at its existing manufacturing facilities as well as measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint through facility and equipment investments and acquisitions. Those investments will help improve the Company's ability to satisfy demand for affordable housing. During fiscal 2023, robust demand for housing began to slow as inflation and higher interest rates made housing less affordable. The current economic environment drives an even greater need for attainable housing solutions. As a result, the Company continues to focus on growing in strong housing markets across the U.S. and Canada, as well as expanding products and services to provide more holistic and affordable solutions to homebuyers. 
 In October 2023, the Company acquired Regional Homes, which operated three manufacturing facilities in Alabama and 44 retail sales centers across the Southeast U.S. Regional Home's strong presence in large HUD markets expanded our captive retail and manufacturing distribution in that region. In July 2022, the Company acquired 12 Factory Expo retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation, which expanded the internal retail network across a broader portion of the U.S. In May 2022, the Company acquired Manis Custom Builders, Inc. ("Manis") in order to expand its manufacturing footprint and further streamline its product offering in the Southeast U.S. 
 In addition to those acquisitions, the Company is also focused on enhancing its U.S. manufacturing production capacity through various plant start-ups in strategic locations. As a result, the Company began production in previously idled or acquired facilities in Decatur, Indiana and Bartow, Florida in fiscal 2024 and a facility in Pembroke, North Carolina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company owns six idle manufacturing facilities that could be used for further manufacturing capacity expansion in future periods. 	 
 During fiscal 2024, the Company made an equity investment in ECN. The investment, in part, facilitated the creation of a captive finance company in partnership with Triad, a subsidiary of ECN. The captive finance company, Champion Financing, through Triad, provides factory-built home floor plan and consumer loans to manufactured home retailers and homebuyers. The Company believes this offering will provide customers needed financing solutions and improve the Company's market share. 
 The Company's acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company s homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations through streamlining production of similar product categories. These acquisitions and investments are included in the Company's consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. 
 Industry and Company Outlook 
 The need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has continued to drive demand for new homes in the U.S. and Canadian markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers, and the population of households earning less than 60,000 per year. 
 Because of the need for affordable housing, the Company saw an increase in customers orders during the six months ended September 28, 2024 versus the same period last year that outpaced production rates. As a result, of the increased orders and the acquisition of Regional Homes, the Company's manufacturing backlog was 427.5 million as of September 28, 2024 compared to 257.8 million as of September 30, 2023. 
 16 

For the six months ended September 28, 2024, approximately 87 of the Company s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes are reported on a one-month lag. According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute, HUD-code industry home shipments were 44,278 and 37,536 units during the five months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 21.9 and 17.9 , for the five months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Annual HUD-code industry shipments have generally increased since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, current manufactured housing shipments are still at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units per year. Manufactured home sales represent approximately 9 of all U.S. single family home starts. Our market share in the U.S total housing market was approximately 2.4 and 1.9 for the six months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

Net sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 were 616.9 million, an increase of 152.6 million, or 32.9 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 
 U.S. Factory-built Housing: 
 Net sales for the Company s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by 159.0 million, or 37.1 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of 148.0 million of net sales from Regional Homes in fiscal 2025. The number of new homes sold during the period increased 31.3 and the average selling price per new home increased 4.5 . The increase in the number of homes sold was due to higher customer demand and production volumes compared to the prior year, and the inclusion of Regional Homes in fiscal 2025. The increase in average selling price was due to the increase in the number of units sold through our company-owned retail sales centers, also in part a result of the addition of Regional Homes. The mix of wholesale unit sales sold to independent channels versus homes sold through our company-owned retail sales centers impacts average selling price since we capture revenue from additional installation services for homes sold through internal channels. 
 Canadian Factory-built Housing: 
 The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by 7.0 million, or 24.0 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 22.8 decrease in homes sold and a 1.5 decrease in average home selling price. The decrease in homes sold is due to slowing demand in the Canadian market. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately 1.2 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. 
 Corporate/Other: 
 Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company s transportation business, financing activities, and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended September 28, 2024, net sales increased 0.7 million, or 9.8 , primarily attributable to Champion Financing, partially offset by lower recreational vehicle shipments from the Company's transportation business.

 U.S. Factory-built Housing: 
 Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by 51.2 million, or 48.8 , during the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was 26.6 as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 24.5 in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit as a percent of segment net sales is being driven by higher average selling prices from our Company owned retail stores, which also generated a greater percentage of total segment revenue than the prior year as well as lower input costs primarily from forest products and higher capacity utilization. 
 Canadian Factory-built Housing: 
 Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by 3.2 million, or 39.6 , during the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to lower sales volumes and average selling prices caused by slowing demand. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 21.8 for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 27.4 in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to less absorption of fixed costs due to lower sales volumes. 
 Corporate/Other: 
 Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased 1.8 million, or 52.4 , during the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due primarily to the inclusion of Champion Financing. 
 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses include in part costs that are not directly attributable to the manufacture or resale of our products, including foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense.

 19 

U.S. Factory-built Housing: 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased 30.2 million, or 64.7 , during the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. SG A, as a percent of segment net sales increased to 13.1 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 10.9 during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. The acquisition of Regional Homes was the primary driver of the increase in both the amount of SG A and as a percent of sales. Sales through our internal retail channels incur a higher percent of SG A than wholesale sales to independent retailers. We also had higher incentive compensation during the period, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability. 
 Canadian Factory-built Housing: 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased 0.3 million, or 11.3 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales increased to 10.4 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 8.9 during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year due to decreased leverage of fixed manufacturing costs. 
 Corporate/Other: 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased 5.3 million, or 35.0 , during the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to investments made in people and information systems to support future growth.

 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was 74.2 million, an increase of 15.4 million from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily a result of higher sales volumes and gross profit, partially offset by higher SG A expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of Regional Homes.

Net sales for the six months ended September 28, 2024 were 1.2 billion, an increase of 315.7 million, or 34.0 , compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 
 U.S. Factory-built Housing: 
 Net sales for the Company s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by 329.7 million, or 38.5 , for the six months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of 299.4 million of net sales from Regional Homes in fiscal 2025. The number of homes sold during the period increased 33.5 and the average home selling price increased 3.7 . The increase in the number of homes sold was due to higher customer demand and production volumes compared to the prior year and the inclusion of Regional Homes in fiscal 2025. The increase in average selling price was due to the increase in the number of units sold through our company-owned retail sales centers, also in part a result of the addition of Regional Homes. The mix of wholesale unit sales versus homes sold through our company-owned stores impacts average selling price. During the six months ended September 28, 2024, wholesale average selling price per new home decreased due to the changes in product mix, including customers choosing homes with fewer or lower cost options. 
 Canadian Factory-built Housing: 
 The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by 12.3 million, or 22.3 for the six months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 23.6 decrease in homes sold, partially offset by a 1.8 increase in average home selling price. The decrease in homes sold is due to slowing demand in the Canadian market. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.8 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the six months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. 
 Corporate/Other: 
 Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company s transportation business, financing activities and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the six months ended September 28, 2024, net sales decreased 1.7 million, or 10.5 , primarily attributable to the decrease in recreational vehicle shipments, offset in part by the inclusion of Champion Financing.

 U.S. Factory-built Housing: 
 Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by 87.2 million or 39.0 , during the six months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit was driven by higher unit volume due to higher customer demand and production rates and the inclusion of Regional Homes. Gross profit was 26.2 as a percent of segment net sales for the six months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 26.1 in the same period of the prior fiscal year. 
 Canadian Factory-built Housing: 
 Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by 4.8 million, or 32.2 during the six months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to lower sales volumes. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 23.7 for the six months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 27.2 in the same period of the prior year, primarily the result of decreased leverage of fixed manufacturing costs. 
 Corporate/Other: 
 Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased 2.1 million, or 27.3 , during the six months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Gross profit increased as a a result of the revenue mix in the Company's transportation operations and the inclusion of Champion Financing. 
 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses include in part costs that are not directly attributable to the manufacture or resale of our products, including foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense.

U.S. Factory-built Housing: 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased 64.2 million, or 65.6 , during the six months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales increased to 13.7 for the six months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 11.4 during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to the acquisition of Regional Homes, including a charge of 7.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration included in the acquisition of Regional Homes, as well as higher incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability. 
 Canadian Factory-built Housing: 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment were flat when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales increased to 12.1 for the six months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 9.4 during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year due to less absorption of fixed costs caused by lower sales. 
 24 

Corporate/Other: 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased 9.4 million, or 29.5 , during the six months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due primarily to higher incentive and stock-based compensation expense and investments made in people and information systems to support future growth.

The effective tax rate for the six months ended September 28, 2024 was positively impacted by an increase in recognition of tax credits related to the sale of energy efficient homes. 
 The Company s effective tax rates for the six months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 differ from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions.

indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended September 28, 2024 was 149.2 million, an increase of 23.6 million from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily a result of higher sales volumes and gross profit, partially offset by higher SG A expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of Regional Homes. 
 The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss attributable to Champion Homes, Inc. plus expense or minus income: (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest (income) expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets; (f) equity in net earnings or losses of ECN; (g) charges related to the remediation of the water intrusion product liability claims; and (h) other non-operating income and costs, including but not limited to those costs for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses, including the change in fair value of contingent consideration, and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 26 

Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company s financial performance that management believes is useful to investors, because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company s operating activities across reporting periods. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating operating performance for the following reasons: (i) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other non-operating income or loss, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and (ii) analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry. 
 Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts: (i) in communications with the Board of Directors and investors concerning financial performance; (ii) as a factor in determining bonuses under certain incentive compensation programs; and (iii) as a measure of operating performance used to determine the ability to provide cash flows to support investments in capital assets, acquisitions and working capital requirements for operating expansion. 
 BACKLOG 
 Although orders from customers can be canceled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at September 28, 2024 totaled 427.5 million compared to 257.8 million at September 30, 2023. The increase in backlog is due to higher net orders and the acquisition of Regional Homes.

The Company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flows from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives and investments. The Company has an Amended Credit Agreement which provides for a 200.0 million revolving credit facility, including a 45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. At September 28, 2024, 168.5 million was available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company s revolving credit facility includes (i) a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, subject to an upward adjustment upon the consummation of a material acquisition, and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year and beyond. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise its operating strategies. 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 144.4 million for the six months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 129.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher income before non-cash charges, including the charge for the change in fair value of contingent consideration for the Regional Homes acquisition, partially offset by less favorable changes in working capital items during the first six months of fiscal 2025 as compared to the same period of the prior year. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 22.6 million for the six months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 174.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used for investing activities was related to the Company's investment in floor plan loans, ECN common stock and ECN preferred stock in fiscal 2024 which did not recur in fiscal 2025. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 47.3 million for the six months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 0.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash between periods was primarily due to repurchases of the Company's common stock totaling 40.0 million in the first half of fiscal 2025.

 Item 4. 	 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 The Company s management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act at September 28, 2024. Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2024. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. In October 2023, we completed the acquisition of Regional Homes and are currently integrating Regional Homes into our operations, compliance programs and internal control processes. Regional Homes constituted approximately 26 of our total assets as of September 28, 2024, including the goodwill and intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase price allocation and approximately 24 of our net sales for the six months ended September 28, 2024. United States Securities and Exchange Commission guidance allows companies to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of the internal control over financial reporting during the first year following an acquisition while integrating the acquired company. We have excluded the acquired operations of Regional Homes from our assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
