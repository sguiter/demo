The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management plans to address this uncertainty through related party loans from the Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors or their affiliates Working Capital Loans and effecting a Business Combination. However, there is no assurance that the Company s plans to raise capital or to consummate a Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Extended Combination Period. In addition, management is currently evaluating the impact of various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond its control.

On November 28, 2023, the Company and the underwriter entered into an agreement under which (i) the Sponsor will transfer 426,000 Class A ordinary shares held by the Sponsor to the underwriter upon the closing of the Company s initial business combination and (ii) the underwriter will waive the deferred underwriter fee payable and any deferred underwriting commissions payable pursuant to the underwriter agreement dated April 22, 2021. For avoidance of doubt, the agreement applies only if the initial Business Combination is consummated, and the transfer of shares is effective and completed. Except as specifically amended in the agreement, all terms of the underwriting agreement dated April 22, 2021 shall remain in full force and effect. Commitments and Contingencies Registration and Shareholder Rights The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants, and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering, requiring the Company to register such securities for resale. The holders will have the right to require us to register for resale these securities pursuant to a shelf registration under Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The holders of a majority of these securities will also be entitled to make up to three demands, plus short form registration demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders will be entitled to certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option from the date of the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discount. The underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full on January 18, 2022, the date of the Initial Public Offering. The underwriter was entitled to a cash underwriting discount of 0.20 per Unit, or 3,795,000 in the aggregate, which was paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, the underwriter is entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per Unit, or 6,641,250 in the aggregate. The deferred fee is payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. On November 28, 2023, the Company and BTIG entered into an agreement under which BTIG waived its entitlement to the payment of the deferred compensation and instead receive 426,000 Class A ordinary shares from shares held by the Sponsor only in the event of the closing of a Business Combination. Accordingly, BTIG will not receive any portion of the 6,641,250 deferred underwriting fee in the event of the closing of a Business Combination. Pursuant to the Waiver, BTIG resigned from every capacity, role or involvement in which BTIG may otherwise be described in any registration statement as acting or agreeing to act in the future with respect to any business combination of CSLM and/or its Sponsor. The Company has agreed to register shares received by BTIG from Consilium Acquisition Sponsor I, LLC, the Company s Sponsor, upon the closing of its initial Business Combination. In the event that such shares are not registered, the underwriter s deferred fee shall be reinstated.

Founder Transaction Bonus Agreement The founder and Chief Executive Officer of Fusemachines (the Executive is eligible to receive a transaction bonus in cash equal to the lesser of (i) 20 of each dollar of Parent closing cash in excess of 1,000,000, and (ii) 1,000,000 at the time of the closing of the business combination (the Closing ). The Founder Transaction Bonus Agreement is subject to (i) the Executive actively supporting and working towards the completion of all of the requirements necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as reasonably determined by the Company and Parent, prior to the Closing, (ii) the Executive continuing to be employed in good standing by the Company from the date hereof through the Closing, and (iii) the Closing of the Merger. If all of the foregoing conditions are satisfied, the Founder Transaction Bonus Agreement amount shall be paid to the Executive concurrently with the Closing. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us or any of our officers or directors in their corporate capacity.

Item 1A. Risk Factors Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. Nasdaq Rule 5815 was amended effective October 7, 2024 to provide for the immediate suspension and delisting for failure to meet the 36-month requirement in Nasdaq Rule IM 5101-2(b) to complete a business combination, and our securities will face an immediate suspension and delisting action once we receive a delisting determination letter from Nasdaq after the 36-month window ends on January 12, 2025 Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2(b) (the Rule ), requires that we complete a business combination no later than 36 months after our IPO, and Nasdaq Rule 5815 was amended effective October 7, 2024 to provide for the immediate suspension and delisting for failure to meet the 36-month requirement to complete a business combination in the Rule, and our securities will face an immediate suspension and delisting action once we receive a delisting determination letter from Nasdaq after the 36-month window ends on January 12, 2025. Therefore, if we do not complete our business combination by January 12, 2025, which we will not be able to do, our securities will be suspended and delisted from Nasdaq. In addition, while we may appeal the suspension and delisting, a Nasdaq hearings panel will have no discretion in allowing us to remain listed and may only reverse the Nasdaq s staff s determination if it finds it made a factual error applying the Rule, which there will not be assuming that we receive a delisting letter on or after January 12, 2025. If we extend the time to complete a business combination after January 12, 2025, which is beyond the time-frame permitted by the Rule, we will not be listed at the time we close a business combination. If we are not able to meet Nasdaq initial listing requirement in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, Fusemachines may elect to terminate the Business Combination Agreement and not proceed with the business combination. Once our securities are delisted, our securities would likely trade on the Over the Counter market, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. If this were to occur, we would face significant material adverse consequences, including. 

a determination that our Public Shares are a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in the Public Shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for its securities; 

limited availability of market quotations for the Company s securities; 

reduced liquidity for the Company s securities; 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. Because we would no longer be listed on Nasdaq, our securities would no longer be considered to be covered securities under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities, including in connection with our initial business combination, which may make more difficult and costly to complete a business combination. In addition, our securityholders could be prohibited from trading in our securities absent our registration in the state where such securityholder lives. To date we have not registered our securities in any State, and do not currently plan to do so. This may make it difficult or impossible for our securityholders to trade in our securities. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use Of Proceeds Unregistered Sales Prior to our initial public offering, our sponsor, paid an aggregate of 25,000 to cover certain expenses on behalf of us in exchange for 4,743,750 founder shares, resulting in an effective purchase price paid for the founder shares of approximately 0.006 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20 of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares upon completion of this offering. Our sponsor purchased 7,942,500 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at 11.50 per share, at a price of 1.00 per warrant 7,942,500 in the aggregate), in a private placement that closed substantially concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering. These issuances were made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales. Use of Proceeds On January 18, 2022, the Company consummated its initial public offering of 18,975,000 units at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 189,750,000. BTIG, LLC and I-Bankers Securities, Inc. acted as the book-running managers of the offering and BTIG, LLC acted as the representative of the underwriters. The securities sold in the initial public offering were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-261570). The SEC declared the registration statements effective on January 12, 2022. In connection with the initial public offering, we incurred offering costs of approximately 11,236,250 (including deferred underwriting commissions of approximately 6,641,250). Other incurred offering costs consisted principally of preparation fees related to the initial public offering. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion, which amount will be payable upon consummation of the initial business combination, if consummated) and the initial public offering expenses, 191,647,500 million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and certain of the proceeds from the private placement of the private placement warrants (or 10.00 per unit sold in the initial public offering) was placed in the Trust Account. The net proceeds of the initial public offering and certain proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants are held in the Trust Account and invested as described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. On July 13, 2023 as approved by its shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting held on June 29, 2023 (the Special Meeting ), CSLM and its trustee, Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company amended (the Amendment the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of January 12, 2022 (the Trust Agreement ), by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company (the Trustee and the Company, in order to allow the Company to extend the time to complete a business combination by fifteen (15) additional one (1) month periods until, October 18, 2024 (the Termination Date by depositing into the Trust Account 70,000 for each one-month extension (each an Extension ). At the Special Meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved a special resolution to the Articles of Association to extend the time to consummate a business combination until October 18, 2024 and the Amendment in accordance with the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association (the Articles of Association ). In connection with the shareholders vote at the Special Meeting, 14,202,813 Class A shares were tendered for redemption. On July 13, 2023, as was approved by the shareholders at the Special Meeting, the Company submitted a certificate of incorporation of name change to the Cayman Islands Registry of Companies to change our name from Consilium Acquisition Corp I, LTD. to CSLM Acquisition Corp. The name change of the Company to CSLM Acquisition Corp. was effected on Nasdaq at the open of trading on July 18, 2023 and continued trading under the same ticker symbol CSLM .
