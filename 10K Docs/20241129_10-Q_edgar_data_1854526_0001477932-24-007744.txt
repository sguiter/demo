Until we generate material operating revenues, the Company will require additional debt or equity funding to continue its operations, however, there is no assurances that the Company will conduct such an offering or that it will raise sufficient funding to continue its operations.

In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

F-11 Table of Contents ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS brooqLy, Inc. is referred to as we , our , or us . Going Concern At September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of approximately 403,014. Our current liquidity resources are insufficient to fund the anticipated level of operations for at least the next 12 months from the date these condensed financial statements were issued. As a result, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue operations depends on our ability to generate and grow revenue and results of operations as well as our ability to access capital markets when necessary to accomplish our strategic objectives. We expect that we will continue to incur losses in the immediate future and will need additional equity or debt financing until we can achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities. Our future capital requirements for operations will depend on many factors, including the ability to generate revenues and the ability to obtain capital. There is no assurance that we will be successful in any capital-raising efforts that may be undertaken to fund operations and implement our business plan in the future. We will continue our Plan of Operations by: Continual upgrading, development and integration of platform Secure international local partner contracts and create new markets The foregoing goals will increase expenses and lead to possible net losses. There is no assurance that we will ever be profitable or that debt or equity financing will be available to us. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance we will be successful in any of these goals. Results of Operations The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this Report. We have generated minimal revenues from inception to date. We anticipate that we may not receive any significant revenues from operations until we begin our planned operations. For the Three and Nine months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenues For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we generated 266 in revenue and 3 respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024and September 30, 2023, we generated 85 and 1 in total revenue, respectively. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses totaled 252,210 and 247,030 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The 5,180 decrease in operating expenses is primarily attributable to a decrease in marketing expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we incurred 86,462 and 77,539 in operating expenses, respectively. The increase is mainly due to accrued salaries for the officers. Other Income and Expenses We had interest expense of 3,948 and 31,864 for the three months and 154,351 and 31,864 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The interest expense is directly attributable to the conversion of the two Convertible Notes and the Promissory Note that were converted on April 19, 2024 We also had a loss of 0 for the three months and 376,000 and 0 on the conversion of two convertible notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 3 Table of Contents Net Loss For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net loss from operations of 782,294,that is attributed to 252,210 in operating expenses, 154,351 in interest expense and 376,000 from the loss on conversion of two convertible notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a net loss from operations of 278,622 that is due to 247,030 in operating expenses and 31,864 in interest expense. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net loss from operations of 90,324, that is attributed to 86,462 in operating expenses, 3,948 in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a net loss from operations of 109,135 that was due to 77,539 in operating expenses and 31,864 in interest expense. We anticipate losses from operations will increase during the next twelve months due to the anticipated 85,000 in legal and auditing expenses associated with maintaining a reporting company. We expect that we will continue to have net losses from operations until revenues become sufficient to offset operating expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have generated minimal revenues since inception. We have obtained cash for operating expenses mainly through advances and/or loans from affiliates and stockholders. Currently, we have made arrangements with a registered broker dealer to raise additional capital, where they will identify potential investors and negotiate appropriate agreements with them. We may be unable to arrange enough investment within the time the investment is required or that if it is arranged, that it will be on favorable terms. If we cannot obtain the needed capital, we may be unable to become profitable and may have to curtail or cease our operations. Additional equity financing, if available, may be dilutive to the holders of our capital stock. Debt financing may involve significant cash payment obligations, covenants and financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate and grow our business. At September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 403,014. Our current liquidity resources are insufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations. As a result, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue operations depends on our ability to generate and grow revenue as well as access capital markets when necessary to fund strategic objectives. We expect to continue to incur losses in the immediate future and will need additional equity or debt financing until we can achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in any capital-raising efforts that it may undertake to fund operations and implement our business plan in the future. 4 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by/Used in Operating Activities. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was 80,272 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash flow of 129,871 used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to shares issued for loans and interest. Our primary uses of funds in operations were payments made for legal and professional fees. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, our net cash used from investment activities was 90,274 and 22,000, respectively. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities .

Cash Position and Outstanding Indebtedness. Our total indebtedness at September 30, 2024 was 433,217, all of which are considered current liabilities. Current liabilities consist primarily of accounts payable, payroll payable, due to related party and notes payable. At September 30, 2024, we had 30,204 of current assets and our working capital deficit was 403,014. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not and do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. The above discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed financial statements and the related notes. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.
