Special Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements 
 As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless expressly indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to Health Catalyst, we, us, our, the Company, and similar references refer to Health Catalyst, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Forward-looking statements are only predictions based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. All statements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements for purposes of these provisions, including those relating to future events or our future financial performance and financial guidance. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, design, intend, expect, could, plan, potential, predict, seek, should, would, target, project, or contemplate, the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology, and other words or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of expectations, projections, plans, strategy, intentions, or future results of operations or financial performance. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements about our: 
 ability to attract new clients and retain and expand our relationships with existing clients; 
 ability to expand our service offerings, develop new platform features, and rollout and migrate existing DOS Subscription Clients to our new platform, Health Catalyst Ignite; 
 
 1 

future financial performance, including trends in revenue, costs of revenue, gross margin, and operating expenses; 
 ability to compete successfully in competitive markets; 
 ability to respond to rapid technological changes; 
 expectations and management of future growth; 
 ability to enter new markets and manage our expansion efforts, particularly internationally; 
 ability to attract and retain highly-qualified employees, whom we refer to as team members; 
 ability to effectively and efficiently protect our brand; 
 ability to timely scale and adapt our infrastructure; 
 ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property and not infringe upon others intellectual property; 
 ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate companies and assets; 
 expectations regarding our key financial metrics; and 
 expectations regarding the impact of any macroeconomic challenges (including high inflationary and/or high interest rate environments or market volatility and measures taken in response thereto) and any new public health crisis, on our business and results of operations. 
 These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in the section titled Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other documents that may be filed by us from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. 
 The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Summary of Risk Factors 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and results of operations will be harmed. 
 We may be unable to successfully execute on our growth initiatives, business strategies, or operating plans as well as cost reduction and restructuring initiatives. 
 If we fail to effectively manage our growth and organizational change, our business and results of operations could be harmed. 
 
 2 

Macroeconomic challenges (including high inflationary and/or high interest rate environments, or market volatility and measures taken in response thereto) and any new public health crisis could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 If we do not continue to innovate and provide services that are useful to clients and users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenue and results of operations could suffer. 
 Our business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our cloud-based data platform, software analytics applications, and professional services expertise (our Solution). 
 If our existing clients do not continue or renew their contracts with us, renew at lower fee levels, or decline to purchase additional technology and services from us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our business and operations may suffer in the event of information technology system failures, cyberattacks, or deficiencies in our cybersecurity. 
 Actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Our Solution is dependent on our ability to source data from third parties, and such third parties could take steps to block our access to data, or increase fees or impose fees for such access, which could impair our ability to provide our Solution, limit the effectiveness of our Solution, or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our results of operations have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of an investment in our common stock could decline substantially. 
 Our term loan facility exposes us to interest rate risks, contains covenants and other provisions that restrict our ability to take certain actions, and may limit our ability to operate or grow our business in the future. 
 
 Our pricing may change over time and our ability to efficiently price our Solution will affect our results of operations and our ability to attract or retain clients. 
 
 If our Solution fails to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of our Solution is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could be exposed to litigation, investigations or have liability to clients, clinicians, patients, or others, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We rely on third-party providers, including Microsoft Azure, for computing infrastructure, network connectivity, and other technology-related services needed to deliver our Solution. Any disruption in the services provided by such third-party providers could adversely affect our business and subject us to liability. 
 We rely on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties, and our own systems for providing our Solution to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation, potentially require us to issue credits to our clients, and negatively impact our relationships with users or clients, adversely affecting our brand and our business. 
 Failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.

 operating segments that also represent our reportable segments. Our segments are (1) technology and (2) professional services.

 term, of which many are terminable after upon days notice. 
 Subscriptions that allow the client to take software on-premise without significant penalty are treated as time-based licenses. These arrangements generally include access to technology, access to unspecified future products, and maintenance and support. Revenue for upfront access to our technology library is recognized at a point in time when the technology is made available to the client. Revenue for access to unspecified future products included in time-based license subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the date that the access is made available to the client.

 million and million, respectively. 
 We record contract liabilities as deferred revenue when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. Deferred revenue primarily relates to the advance consideration received from the client. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total of current and non-current deferred revenue on our condensed consolidated balance sheets was million and million, respectively. 
 Deferred costs 
 We capitalize sales commissions and associated fringe costs, such as benefits and payroll taxes, paid to direct sales personnel and other incremental costs of obtaining contracts with clients, provided we expect to recover those costs. We determine that costs should be deferred based on our sales compensation plans when the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the client contract.

 million and million, respectively, of deferred contract acquisition costs are expected to be amortized within the next months and are included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the remaining million and million, respectively, of deferred contract acquisition costs are included in non-current other assets. 
 Commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a contract are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated period of benefit of . Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. The period of benefit was estimated by considering factors such as estimated average client life, the rate of technological change in our subscription service, and the impact of competition in our industry. As our average client life significantly exceeded the rate of change in our technology, we concluded that the rate of change in the technology underlying our subscription service was the most significant factor in determining the period of benefit for which the asset relates. In evaluating the rate of change in our technology, we considered the competition in our industry, our commitment to continuous innovation, and the frequency of product, platform, and technology updates. We determined that the impact of competition in our industry is reflected in the period of benefit through the rate of technological change. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is included within sales and marketing expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 We defer certain costs to fulfill a contract when the costs are expected to be recovered, are directly related to in-process contracts, and enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future. These deferred fulfillment costs primarily consist of employee compensation incurred as part of the implementation of new contracts. Amortization of deferred fulfillment costs is included within cost of revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. We periodically review these deferred costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. There were impairment losses recorded during the periods presented. 
 Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization 
 Cost of technology revenue primarily consists of costs associated with hosting and supporting our technology, including third-party cloud computing and hosting costs, license and revenue share fees, contractor costs, and salary and related personnel costs for our cloud services and support teams. Cost of professional services revenue primarily consists of salary and related personnel costs, travel-related costs, and independent contractor costs. Cost of revenue in the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations excludes costs related to depreciation and amortization.

 When there are indicators of potential impairment, we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values by comparing the carrying amount of the applicable asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset, plus any terminal value, in the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds those estimated future net cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.

The resulting goodwill from the Lumeon acquisition was fully allocated to the technology reporting unit and is not deductible for income tax purposes. 
 The preliminary allocation of the consideration transferred is subject to potential adjustments. Balances subject to adjustment are primarily tax-related matters, including the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized in our initial accounting for the acquisition. We expect the allocation of the consideration transferred to be final within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). There were no measurement period adjustments recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The retention payments are generally subject to vesting based upon continued employment over a required service period. Such amounts are recorded as post-combination compensation expense and recognized on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting terms.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we identified asset impairment indicators for multiple of our corporate office spaces designated for subleasing. We performed a recoverability test of the relevant asset group, comprised of operating lease ROU and other related assets, and determined that the carrying value of this asset group was not fully recoverable. As a result, we measured and recognized total impairment charges of million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of this asset group. The impairment charges were recorded as part of general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, million of the impairment charge was allocated to ROU assets and the remaining million was allocated to leasehold improvements, while during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, million of the impairment charge was allocated to ROU assets and the remaining million was allocated to leasehold improvements.

 million under the delayed draw facility within after the Closing Date and up to an additional million under the delayed draw facility within eighteen months after the Closing Date, in each case, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including a minimum liquidity threshold and a maximum recurring revenue/leverage ratio. We are required to pay a commitment fee on the unutilized commitments under the delayed draw term loan facility ranging from to per year depending on the year and the amount of the unutilized delayed draw term loan. The deferred financing costs related to the delayed draw facility, including the directly attributable debt discount, have been capitalized to other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, and amortized to interest expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations, in each case over the respective terms. 
 Borrowings under the initial term loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus .

We expect to use the proceeds from the delayed draw term loan facility, if any, to fund our inorganic growth strategy through permitted acquisitions (including deferred purchase price or similar arrangements related thereto) and to pay fees, costs, and expenses in connection therewith. 
 We are required to prepay the term loans upon the occurrence of certain events, and we may voluntarily prepay the term loans, in whole or in part, at any time, subject to certain notice requirements and prepayment amounts. Prior to July 16, 2028, such mandatory prepayments or voluntary prepayments are subject to a prepayment premium ranging from to plus a make whole amount depending on the year of such prepayment. 
 Our obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents are required to be guaranteed by all of our present and future domestic and foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (Guarantors).

 million in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (Notes), in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers exempt from registration under the Securities Act (Note Offering). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and offering expenses payable by us. 
 The Notes are governed by an indenture (the Indenture) between us, as the issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes are our senior, unsecured obligations and accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2020, at a rate of per year. The Notes will mature on April 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The Indenture does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. 
 On or after April 20, 2023, we may redeem, for cash, all or a portion of the Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes. 
 The Notes have an initial conversion rate of 32.6797 shares of our common stock per principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock). Following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such corporate event. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a corporate event that constitutes a fundamental change per the Indenture, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
 Holders of the Notes were able to convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time prior to the close of business on October 14, 2024, in integral multiples of principal amount, only under the following circumstances: 
 During any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ended on June 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 
 During the business day period after any consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price as defined in the Indenture per principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 
 If we call such notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or 
 Upon the occurrence of specified corporate events described in the Indenture. 
 On or after October 15, 2024, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at the conversion rate at any time irrespective of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, holders will receive cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election.

 per share on the last trading day of the period ended September 30, 2024, the if-converted value of the Notes was less than their respective principal amounts. 
 Capped calls 
 On April 8, 2020, concurrently with the pricing of the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (Base Capped Calls) with certain option counterparties. In addition, in connection with the initial purchasers exercise in full of their option to purchase additional Notes, on April 9, 2020, we entered into additional capped call transactions (together with the Base Capped Calls, the Capped Calls) with each of the option counterparties. We used approximately million of the net proceeds from the Note Offering to pay the cost of the Capped Calls and allocated issuance costs. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to the cap price. 
 The Capped Calls are separate transactions that we entered into with the option counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Notes. As the Capped Call transactions are considered indexed to our own stock and are considered equity classified, they were recorded in stockholders equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost incurred in connection with the Capped Calls was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The number of shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP shall be cumulatively increased by the least of (i) shares, (ii) percent of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, and (iii) such lesser number of shares of common stock as determined by the ESPP Administrator. As of January 1, 2024, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP increased by shares. 
 The ESPP generally provides for offering periods. The offering periods generally start on the first trading day after June 30 and December 31 of each year. The ESPP permits participants to elect to purchase shares of common stock through fixed percentage contributions from eligible compensation during each offering period, not to exceed of the eligible compensation a participant receives during an offering period or accrue at a rate which exceeds of the fair value of the stock (determined on the option grant date(s)) for each calendar year. 
 A participant may purchase the lowest of (i) a number of shares of common stock determined by dividing such participant s accumulated payroll deductions on the exercise date by the option price, (ii) shares, or (iii) such other lesser maximum number of shares as shall have been established by the ESPP Administrator in advance of the offering period. Amounts deducted and accumulated by the participant will be used to purchase shares of common stock at the end of each offering period. 
 The purchase price of the shares will be of the lower of the fair value of common stock on the first trading day of each offering period or on the purchase date. Participants may end their participation at any time during an offering period and will be paid their accumulated contributions that have not been used to purchase shares of common stock. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment.

 We consider all available evidence to evaluate the recovery of deferred tax assets, including historical levels of income, legislative developments, and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income. We have provided a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, due to the uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such assets and the cumulative losses we have generated. 
 We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. We do not anticipate material changes in the total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of the reporting date.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes, and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements below. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the sections titled Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a leading provider of data and analytics technology and services to healthcare organizations. Our Solution comprises our cloud-based data platforms, software analytics applications, and professional services expertise. Our clients, which are primarily healthcare providers, use our Solution to manage their data, derive analytical insights to operate their organization, and produce measurable clinical, financial, and operational improvements. We envision a future where all healthcare decisions are data informed. 
 Highlights from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included: 
 We recognized total revenue of 76.4 million and 73.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 227.0 million and 220.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The growth in revenue was primarily due to revenue from new clients and revenue expansion from existing clients. 
 We incurred net losses of 14.7 million and 22.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 48.8 million and 87.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA was 7.3 million and 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 18.2 million and 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. See the section titled Key Financial Metrics Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more information about Adjusted EBITDA, including the limitations of such measure and a reconciliation to net loss, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 See the section titled Key Factors Affecting Our Performance for more information about important opportunities and challenges related to our business. 
 
 Macroeconomic Environment and Strategic Operating Plan 
 Recent macroeconomic challenges (including high levels of inflation and high interest rates) and the tight labor market continue to adversely affect workforces, organizations, governments, clients, economies, and financial markets globally. These factors have disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including our business. These factors have also placed the national healthcare system under significant operational and budgetary strain. 
 The health system end market, in particular, has experienced meaningful financial strain over the last couple of years, in which it has realized significant increases in labor and supply costs without a commensurate increase in revenue, leading to a deterioration in operating margins across many of our clients and prospective clients. We saw a decrease in pipeline demand in 2023 relative to the period prior due to the onset of these macroeconomic factors in 2022, as well as some elevated realized and anticipated down-sell and churn levels, primarily for the parts of our Solution that do not offer near-term, financial return on investment (ROI), such as our clinically-focused technology offerings and our more traditional consulting Professional Services. 
 
 46 

In recent quarters, we have been encouraged to have seen incremental improvements, including in the nine month period ending September 30, 2024, and we are encouraged to see improving and stabilizing operating margins for clients and prospective clients in our health system end market. With respect to other near-term implications of the macroeconomic environment, we anticipate improvement in our 2024 bookings metrics relative to 2022 and 2023 for both net new DOS Subscription Client additions and Dollar-based Retention Rate. As it relates to Dollar-based Retention Rate, we expect execution on bookings in the fourth quarter of 2024, including Tech-enabled Managed Services (TEMS) bookings, to have a meaningful impact on our Dollar-based Retention Rate for the 2024 year. We also anticipate that a higher proportion of our net bookings will occur in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to our historical average. 
 Through September 30, 2024, our year-to-date net new DOS Subscription Client additions had a lower average starting annual recurring revenue (ARR) as compared to historical levels. We currently expect our aggregated average subscription revenue and non-recurring revenue for all net new DOS Subscription Clients signed in the year ended December 31, 2024 (net new 2024 DOS Subscription Clients) will be between 400,000 and 1,000,000, driven primarily by momentum in modular additions from Health Catalyst Ignite, such as Healthcare.AI and Ninja Universe, Health Catalyst Ignite s interoperability platform, which has resulted in subscription revenue that is significantly lower than subscription revenue derived from a contract that includes access to all of the DOS platform components and analytic applications. Our modular pricing, which can be lower than our historical averages, has enabled a higher volume of opportunities. This average dollar range is comprised of net new 2024 DOS Subscription Clients with (i) average revenue in the expected average range or significantly above the expected average range noted above, driven by the size of the client organization and the bundle of technology and services included in their subscription and (ii) average revenue meaningfully below the low-end of the expected range noted above, driven by sales of stand-alone Health Catalyst Ignite module components, which provided greater deal certainty in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, and which we believe will provide an opportunity to expand our relationship with these DOS Subscription Clients in the future, including through cross-selling efforts. 
 We have introduced Health Catalyst Ignite, our next-generation data and analytics platform, which benefits from significant scalability and modularity. We expect to migrate existing DOS Subscription Clients to this new platform over the next approximately two years. Over the medium-term, we expect the migration to Health Catalyst Ignite to result in a technology gross margin tailwind; however, we expect a near-term headwind as clients are being migrated. We anticipate new DOS Subscription Clients in 2024 and beyond will be deployed directly onto Health Catalyst Ignite. Furthermore, given the modularity of Health Catalyst Ignite and migrations to its platform, we now primarily refer to DOS Subscription Clients as Platform Subscription Clients. Our Health Catalyst Ignite platform provides advantages related to elastic compute and modularity and allows us to offer a flexible menu of options for clients to benefit from these improved efficiencies. These options include expanding their relationship and spend by purchasing additional applications and features; immediate savings while maintaining the same functionality through a price reduction as part of the migration; or maintaining existing spend and realizing improvement in operations and functionality from the enhanced capabilities of Health Catalyst Ignite. 
 We benefit from a highly recurring revenue model, in which greater than 90 of our revenue is recurring in nature, and a high level of technology revenue predictability, especially within our Platform Subscription Clients whose contracts, when sold as a bundle with our analytics applications, often have annual built-in, contractual technology revenue escalators. As previously described, within our professional services segment, a subset of clients have reduced their spend, while in the technology segment, a subset of modular clients and smaller platform clients have reduced their application and analytics spend. However, we anticipate our aggregate churn levels in 2024 to improve compared to 2023. 
 Given the improved bookings performance of our TEMS offering in recent years, a higher proportion of our bookings in 2023 came from our professional services offering relative to 2022, as health systems looked for solutions to effectively address their near-term expense challenges. While this change in bookings mix will lead to lower professional services gross margin and Adjusted Professional Services Gross Margin and Total Adjusted Gross Margin in future years, we expect that we will achieve improvements in net loss and Adjusted EBITDA as a result of the minimal incremental operating expense required to support our TEMS growth. We continue to anticipate that our adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue will trend lower, largely due to our restructuring efforts and meaningful continued operating leverage. 
 
 47 

We continue to proactively respond to the macroeconomic environment with a strategic operating plan that emphasizes our offerings and go-to-market approach in the areas where we have the most competitive differentiation and where clients are most likely to achieve measurable financial and operational ROI both in the near term and over time. We believe this focus will enable us to move forward in a position of continued competitive and financial strength. We will continue to refine this strategic operating plan and are continuing to make several investments in research and development, primarily in enhancing the capabilities within Health Catalyst Ignite, in order to maintain our position as a market-leading data platform over the long term. 
 
 Key Financial Metrics 
 We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key financial metrics, to manage our business and evaluate our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 GAAP Financial Measures: 
 (in thousands, except percentages) (in thousands, except percentages) Total revenue 76,353 73,773 226,978 220,854 Gross profit 
 27,758 25,339 85,885 80,100 Gross margin 
 36 34 38 36 Net loss 
 (14,726) (22,032) (48,829) (87,835) Non-GAAP Financial Measures: 
 Adjusted Gross Profit 
 36,289 34,572 112,412 109,367 Adjusted Gross Margin 
 48 47 50 50 Adjusted EBITDA 7,295 1,992 18,194 9,669 
 We monitor the key metrics set forth in the preceding table to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations, and determine team member incentives. We discuss Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA in more detail below. 
 Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA, are useful in evaluating our operating performance. For example, we exclude stock-based compensation expense because it is non-cash in nature and excluding this expense provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and allows investors the ability to make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies. We use this non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations, as a component in determining employee bonus compensation, and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. 
 We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin 
 Gross profit is a GAAP financial measure that is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue, including depreciation and amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired technology. We calculate gross margin as gross profit divided by our revenue. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as gross profit, adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) stock-based compensation, (iii) acquisition-related costs, net, and (iv) restructuring costs, as applicable. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as our Adjusted Gross Profit divided by our revenue. We believe Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are useful to investors as they eliminate the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allow a direct comparison of these measures between periods without the impact of non-cash expenses, as well as certain other non-recurring operating expenses, and certain other non-recurring operating expenses. 
 We present both of these measures for our technology and professional services business. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as these metrics generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall profitability. 
 The following is a calculation of our gross profit and gross margin and a reconciliation of gross profit and gross margin to our Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin in total and for technology and professional services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Technology gross margin decreased from 53 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 51 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Adjusted Technology Gross Margin decreased from 68 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 65 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This year-over-year result was mainly driven by continued costs associated with transitioning a portion of our client base to Azure-hosted environments as well as from costs associated with migrating a subset of Platform Subscription Clients to Health Catalyst Ignite, partially offset by existing clients paying higher technology access fees from contractual, built-in escalators, without a corresponding increase in hosting costs. 
 We expect Adjusted Technology Gross Margin to fluctuate and potentially decline in the near term, primarily due to additional costs associated with the migration of clients to Health Catalyst Ignite and Ninja Universe deployment costs incurred prior to the commencement of revenue recognition. The potential decline is also attributable to a small subset of modular clients reducing their subscriptions to our software analytic applications, which tend to be higher margin offerings. 
 Professional services gross margin increased from 4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Adjusted Professional Services Gross Margin increased from 12 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 17 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher utilization rates and cost management efforts, driven in large part by the reduction in force that primarily occurred late in the fourth quarter of 2023 and early 2024. Our professional services are comprised of data and analytics services, domain expertise services, TEMS, and implementation services. The majority of our professional services revenue is generated from data and analytic services and domain expertise services, which are the highest gross margin professional services we provide. The delivery mix among all of our services in a given period can lead to fluctuations in our Adjusted Professional Services Gross Margin. 
 Total gross margin increased from 34 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 36 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Total Adjusted Gross Margin increased from 47 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 48 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We expect total Adjusted Gross Margin to fluctuate and decline in the near term, primarily due to anticipated growth in professional services, including TEMS.

Technology gross margin remained consistent at 52 for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Adjusted Technology Gross Margin decreased from 69 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This year-over-year result was mainly driven by continued costs associated with transitioning a portion of our client base to Azure-hosted environments as well as from costs associated with migrating a subset of Platform Subscription Clients to Health Catalyst Ignite, partially offset by existing clients paying higher technology access fees from contractual, built-in escalators, without a corresponding increase in hosting costs. 
 We expect Adjusted Technology Gross Margin to fluctuate and potentially decline in the near term, primarily due to additional costs associated with the migration of clients to Health Catalyst Ignite, also due to costs associated with Ninja Universe deployments prior to revenue recognition. The potential decline is also attributable to a small subset of modular clients reducing their subscriptions to our software analytic applications, which tend to be higher margin offerings. 
 Professional services gross margin increased from 8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 14 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Adjusted Professional Services Gross Margin increased from 16 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher utilization rates and cost management efforts, driven in large part by the reduction in force that primarily occurred late in the fourth quarter of 2023 and early 2024.

 In the fourth quarter of 2023, our board of directors approved workforce reductions as part of a restructuring plan intended to optimize our cost structure and focus our investment of resources in key priority areas to align with strategic changes (2023 Restructuring Plan). These reductions enabled significant improvement in our Adjusted Professional Services Gross Margin in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. However we still expect Adjusted Professional Services Gross Margin to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to changes in the mix of services we provide, the amount of operational overhead required to deliver our services, and clients delaying or reducing services due to a potentially uncertain and challenging macroeconomic environment. 
 Specifically, in the near term, we expect our mix of services to include more TEMS, which have minimal initial services gross margins that gradually increase over time as we drive efficiencies in service delivery through the use of our technology. As part of our TEMS contracts, we often re-badge existing health system team members within the applicable functional area as Health Catalyst team members. We often provide a client with a near-term discount relative to their existing costs for the scope of the TEMS opportunity, and we drive incremental gross margin over time by leveraging our technology and know-how to make processes more efficient and reduce the client s labor costs. While there will be a headwind to gross margin from these TEMS in the near term, we believe this model will benefit our mid and long-term Adjusted EBITDA and profitability targets due to improved direct margin on these services over time, our ability to drive operating leverage with lower relative incremental operating expense investment required, and the fact that these contracts typically result in long-term technology subscription contract renewals or expansions. 
 Total gross margin increased from 36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 38 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Total Adjusted Gross Margin remained constant at 50 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. We expect total Adjusted Gross Margin to fluctuate and decline in the near term, primarily due to anticipated growth in professional services, including TEMS.

Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss adjusted for (i) interest and other (income) expense, net, (ii) income tax provision (benefit), (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, (v) acquisition-related costs, net, (vi) litigation costs, (vii) restructuring costs, and (viii) non-recurring lease-related charges. We view acquisition-related expenses when applicable, such as transaction costs and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities that are directly related to business combinations, as costs that are unpredictable, dependent upon factors outside of our control, and are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period. We believe that excluding restructuring costs, litigation costs, and non-recurring lease-related charges allows for more meaningful comparisons between operating results from period to period as these are separate from the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business and are not part of our ongoing operations. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with useful information on period-to-period performance as evaluated by management and a comparison with our past financial performance, and is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as this metric generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA improved year-over-year as a result of our revenue growth and cost reduction initiatives as well as the timing of some non-headcount expenses. We generally expect annual Adjusted EBITDA to continue to improve going forward, although it may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of non-recurring revenue and the seasonality of certain operating costs. 
 The following is a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe that our future growth, success, and performance are dependent on many factors, including those set forth below. While these factors present significant opportunities for us, they also represent the challenges that we must successfully address in order to grow our business and improve our results of operations. 
 Impact of challenging macroeconomic environment, including high inflation and high interest rates, and the tight labor market. Recent macroeconomic challenges (including the high levels of inflation and high interest rates) and the tight labor market continue to adversely affect workforces, organizations, governments, clients, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility. They have also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours. Our health system end market is currently experiencing meaningful financial strain from significant inflation. In particular, they are experiencing increases in labor and supply costs without a commensurate increase in revenue, leading to significant margin pressure. This margin pressure could continue to decrease healthcare industry spending, adversely affect demand for our technology and services, cause one or more of our clients to file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business, cause one or more of our clients to fail to renew, terminate, or renegotiate their contracts, impact expected spending from new clients, negatively impact collections of accounts receivable, and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. It is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the challenging macroeconomic environment and its effects on our business, results of operations, or financial condition at this time. 
 Add new clients. We believe our ability to increase our client base will enable us to drive growth. Our potential client base is generally in the early stages of data and analytics adoption and maturity. We expect to further penetrate the market over time as potential clients invest in commercial data and analytics solutions. As one of the first data platform and analytics vendors focused specifically on healthcare organizations, we have an early-mover advantage and strong brand awareness. Our clients are large, complex organizations who typically have long procurement cycles, which, as a result, may lead to declines relative to our historic pace of our new client additions, which included small clients. 
 Leverage recent product and services offerings to drive expansion. We believe that our ability to expand within our client base will enable us to drive growth. Over the last few years, we have developed and deployed several new analytics applications, including PowerCosting (formerly known as CORUS), PowerLabor, Touchstone, Patient Safety Monitor, Pop Analyzer (formerly known as Population Builder), Value Optimizer, and others. Because we are in the early stages of certain of our applications lifecycles and maturity, we do not have enough information to know the impact on revenue growth by upselling these applications and associated services to current and new clients. 
 Impact of acquisitions. We have acquired multiple companies over the last few years, including Medicity in June 2018, Able Health in February 2020, Healthfinch in July 2020, Vitalware in September 2020, Twistle in July 2021, KPI Ninja in February 2022, ARMUS in April 2022, ERS in October 2023, Carevive in May 2024, and Lumeon in August 2024. The historical and go-forward revenue growth profiles of these businesses may vary from our core DOS Subscription Clients, which can positively or negatively impact our overall growth rate. For example, Medicity clients have generated a lower dollar-based retention rate than DOS Subscription Clients and we expect declining revenue from Medicity clients in the foreseeable future. As we integrate the teams acquired via our recent acquisitions, we have also incurred integration-related costs and duplicative costs that could impact our operating cost profile in the near term. 
 Changing revenue mix . Our technology and professional services offerings have materially different gross margin profiles. While our professional services offerings help our clients achieve measurable improvements and make them stickier, they have lower gross margins than our technology revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our technology revenue and professional services revenue represented 63 and 37 of total revenue, respectively. Changes in our percentage of revenue attributable to Technology and Professional Services would impact future gross margin and Adjusted Gross Margin. 
 
 54 

Furthermore, changes within the types of professional services we offer over time can have a material impact on our professional services margin and Adjusted Professional Services Gross Margin, impacting our future gross margin and Total Adjusted Gross Margin. See the section titled Key Financial Metrics Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures above for more information. 
 Transitions to Microsoft Azure and migration to Health Catalyst Ignite. We incur hosting fees related to providing DOS through a cloud-based environment hosted by Microsoft Azure. We maintain a small number of clients that have deployed DOS on-premise. We are in the process of migrating clients who deployed DOS on-premise to Azure-hosted environments. The Azure cloud provides clients with more advanced DOS product functionality and a more seamless client experience; however, hosting clients in Azure is more costly than on-premise deployments on a per-client basis. We have also started migrating certain clients to Health Catalyst Ignite. These transitions have and will continue to result in higher cost of technology revenue and a reduced Adjusted Technology Gross Margin. 
 
 Recent Acquisitions 
 Lumeon Acquisition 
 On August 1, 2024, we acquired Lumeon Ltd. (Lumeon), a digital health company dedicated to helping provider organizations mend broken care coordination processes through automated care orchestration. We accounted for the acquisition of Lumeon as a business combination. The acquisition consideration transferred was 39.8 million and was comprised of estimated net cash consideration of 36.2 million, Health Catalyst common shares with a fair value of 2.9 million, and contingent consideration based on certain earn-out performance targets for Lumeon during an earn-out period ending on June 30, 2025, with an acquisition-date fair value of 0.7 million. The purchase resulted in Health Catalyst acquiring 100 ownership in Lumeon. 
 Carevive Acquisition 
 On May 24, 2024, we acquired Carevive Systems, Inc. (Carevive), a leading oncology-focused health technology company centered on understanding and improving the experience of patients with cancer. We accounted for the acquisition of Carevive as a business combination. Oncology providers and life science researchers use Carevive s flagship platform and/or Carevive data in routine clinical practice for treatment care planning, clinical trial screening, care coordination, remote patient monitoring, and/or post-treatment care. The acquisition consideration transferred was 22.1 million and was comprised of net cash consideration of 18.6 million, shares of our common stock with a fair value of 2.6 million, and contingent consideration based on certain earn-out performance targets for Carevive during an earn-out period ending on June 30, 2025, with an acquisition-date fair value of 0.9 million. The purchase resulted in us acquiring 100 ownership in Carevive. 
 ERS Corporation Acquisition 
 On October 2, 2023, we acquired Electronic Registry Systems, Inc. (ERS), a cloud-based provider of clinical registry development and data management software focused on oncology with advanced data analytics expertise, for preliminary consideration of approximately 11.5 million in cash and 175,901 shares of our common stock that was originally subject to revesting over a period of 18 months. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We derive our revenue from sales of technology and professional services. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, technology revenue represented 64 and 62 of total revenue, respectively, and professional services represented 36 and 38 of total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, technology revenue represented 63 and 64 of total revenue, respectively, and professional services represented 37 and 36 of total revenue, respectively. 
 
 55 

Technology revenue. Technology revenue primarily consists of subscription fees charged to clients for access to use our data platform and analytics applications. We provide clients access to our technology through either an all-access or limited-access, modular subscription. Most of our subscription contracts are cloud-based and generally have a three- or five-year term, of which many are terminable after one year upon 90 days notice. The majority of our DOS subscription contracts have built-in annual escalators for technology access fees. Also included in technology revenue is the maintenance and support we provide, which generally includes updates and support services. 
 Professional services revenue. Professional services revenue primarily includes analytics services, domain expertise services, Tech-enabled Managed Services, and implementation services. Professional services arrangements typically include a fee for making FTE services available to our clients on a monthly basis. FTE services generally consist of a blend of analytic engineers, analysts, and data scientists based on the domain expertise needed to best serve our clients. 
 From a revenue mix perspective, we anticipate that full-year 2024 professional services year-over-year revenue growth will slightly outpace technology year-over-year growth, driven by the heavier weighting of our Tech-enabled Managed Services bookings in the second half of 2022 and 2023, as well as the anticipated elevated churn levels, primarily for offerings that do not provide a near-term measurable financial ROI, such as some of our clinically-focused technology offerings and our traditional consulting professional services. 
 Deferred revenue 
 Deferred revenue consists of client billings in advance of revenue being recognized from our technology and professional services arrangements. We primarily invoice our clients for technology arrangements annually or quarterly in advance. Amounts anticipated to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are recorded as deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred revenue, net of current portion on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization 
 Cost of technology revenue. Cost of technology revenue primarily consists of costs associated with hosting and supporting our technology, including third-party cloud computing and hosting costs, license and revenue share fees, contractor costs, and salary and related personnel costs for our cloud services and support teams. 
 Although we expect cost of technology revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase headcount, cloud computing, and hosting costs to accommodate growth, and as we continue to transition clients to third-party hosted data centers with Microsoft Azure and migrate clients to Health Catalyst Ignite, our next generation data platform, we anticipate cost of technology revenue as a percentage of technology revenue will generally decrease over the long term. We expect cost of technology revenue as a percentage of technology revenue to fluctuate and potentially increase in the near term, primarily due to additional costs associated with transitioning a small number of clients from on-premise deployments to Microsoft Azure-hosted environments and migrating clients to Health Catalyst Ignite, our next generation data platform. 
 Cost of professional services revenue. Cost of professional services revenue consists primarily of costs related to delivering our team s expertise in analytics, strategic advisory, improvement, and implementation services. These costs primarily include salary and related personnel costs, travel-related costs, and outside contractor costs. We expect the 2023 Restructuring Plan to reduce future, ongoing cost of professional services revenue. We further expect that the future savings from the reduced headcount will be offset by continued growth in our professional services, including TEMS. 
 
 56 

Operating expense 
 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses primarily include salary and related personnel costs for our sales, marketing, and account management teams, lead generation, marketing events, including our Healthcare Analytics Summit, marketing programs, and outside contractor costs associated with the sale and marketing of our offerings. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our client base, expand in new markets, and increase our brand awareness. The trend and timing of sales and marketing expenses will depend in part on the timing of our expansion into new markets and marketing campaigns. Our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. 
 Research and development. Research and development expenses primarily include salary and related personnel costs for our data platform and analytics applications teams, subscriptions, and outside contractor costs associated with the development of products. We have developed an open, flexible, and scalable data platform. We plan to continue to invest in research and development to develop new solutions and enhance our applications library. The 2023 Restructuring Plan increased our research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2024 due to severance costs, but we expect that the reduction in headcount will reduce future, ongoing research and development expenses. Our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the nature, timing, and extent of these expenses. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses primarily include salary and related personnel costs for our legal, finance, people operations, IT, and other administrative teams, including certain executives. General and administrative expenses also include facilities, subscriptions, corporate insurance, accounting, directors fees, litigation costs, and the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investment and consist of fixed asset depreciation, amortization of intangibles considered to have definite lives, and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs. 
 Interest and other income (expense), net 
 Interest and other income (expense), net primarily consists of income from our investment holdings partially offset by interest expense. Interest expense is primarily attributable to the Notes. It also includes the amortization of discounts on debt and amortization of deferred financing costs related to our debt arrangements. 
 Income tax provision (benefit) 
 Income tax provision (benefit) consists of U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of the realization of the deferred tax assets, we have a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) and tax credits related primarily to research and development. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had federal and state NOLs of 602.6 million and 505.5 million, respectively, which will begin to expire for federal and state tax purposes in 2032 and 2023, respectively. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from ownership changes and, if we undergo an ownership change in the future, our ability to utilize our NOLs and tax credits could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Our NOLs and tax credits may also be limited under similar provisions of state law. 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was enacted and signed into U.S. law. The IRA includes provisions imposing a 1 excise tax on share repurchases in excess of the fair value of stock issuances, including compensatory stock issuances, that occur after December 31, 2022 and introduces a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income. We do not expect the tax provisions of the IRA to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Discussion of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Revenue: Technology 48,653 45,973 2,680 6 Professional services 27,700 27,800 (100) Total revenue 76,353 73,773 2,580 3 Percentage of revenue: Technology 64 62 Professional services 36 38 Total 100 100 
 
 Total revenue was 76.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 73.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.6 million, or 3 . 

60 

Technology revenue was 48.7 million, or 64 of total revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 46.0 million, or 62 of total revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The technology revenue increase was primarily from growth from new Platform Subscription Clients, revenue from existing clients paying higher technology access fees from contractual, annual escalators, and new offerings of expanded support services, partially offset by elevated churn levels. 
 Professional services revenue was essentially flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and represented 36 and 38 of total revenue, respectively. 
 Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization

 General and administrative expenses were 12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.4 million, or 10 . The decrease was primarily due to a 1.6 million decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and a 0.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation. These decreases were partially offset by a 0.8 million increase in salary and related personnel costs and a 0.2 million increase in contractor and outside service provider fees. 
 General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased from 18 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 16 in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Interest and other income (expense), net Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Interest income 4,735 4,458 277 6 Interest expense (6,126) (1,823) (4,303) 236 Other expense 
 (123) (28) (95) 339 Total interest and other income (expense), net 
 (1,514) 2,607 (4,121) (158) 
 
 Interest and other income (expense), net decreased 4.1 million, or 158 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change is primarily due to a 4.3 million increase in interest expense related to our new credit agreement with Silver Point Finance. 
 Income tax provision (benefit) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Income tax provision (benefit) 
 (475) 59 (534) (905) 
 
 Our income tax provision consists of current and deferred taxes for U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. As we have a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, our income tax provision typically consists primarily of minimal state and foreign income taxes, which is the case for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to a foreign deferred income tax benefit offset by minimal current state and foreign income taxes. 
 
 Discussion of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Revenue: Technology 143,254 140,483 2,771 2 Professional services 83,724 80,371 3,353 4 Total revenue 226,978 220,854 6,124 3 Percentage of revenue: Technology 63 64 Professional services 37 36 Total 100 100 
 
 Total revenue was 227.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 220.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 6.1 million, or 3 . 
 Technology revenue was 143.3 million, or 63 of total revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 140.5 million, or 64 of total revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The technology revenue increase was primarily due to growth from new Platform Subscription Clients, revenue from existing clients paying higher technology access fees from contractual, annual escalators, and new offerings of expanded support services, partially offset by elevated churn levels. 
 
 63 

Professional services revenue was 83.7 million, or 37 of total revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 80.4 million, or 36 of total revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The professional services revenue growth is primarily due to implementation, analytics, and other improvement services being provided to Platform Subscription Clients, which includes Tech-enabled Managed Services. 
 Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization: 
 Technology 48,991 45,755 3,236 7 Professional services 71,899 73,774 (1,875) (3) Total cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization 
 120,890 119,529 1,361 1 Percentage of total revenue 54 54 
 Cost of technology revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, was 49.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 45.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.2 million, or 7 . The increase was primarily due to a 3.7 million increase in cloud computing and hosting costs largely from the expanded use of Microsoft Azure to serve existing and new clients, partially offset by a 0.3 million decrease in salary and related personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, and a 0.2 million decrease in license and revenue share fees. 
 Cost of professional services revenue was 71.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 73.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an decrease of 1.9 million, or 3 . Notable changes in the cost of professional services revenue for the period include a 1.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation, a 1.3 million decrease in contractor and outside service provider fees, and a 0.3 million decrease in restructuring charges, partially offset by a 1.1 million increase in in salary and related personnel cost. 
 Operating expenses 
 Sales and marketing Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Sales and marketing 43,145 50,050 (6,905) (14) Percentage of total revenue 19 23 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses were 43.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 50.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 6.9 million, or 14 . The decrease was primarily due to a 7.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation, a 3.0 million decrease in salary and related personnel costs, and a 0.3 million decrease in restructuring charges. These decreases were partially offset by a 1.8 million increase in our provision for expected credit losses and a 1.5 million increase in contractor and outside service provider fees. 
 Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased from 23 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 19 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Research and development Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Research and development 42,948 52,339 (9,391) (18) Percentage of total revenue 19 24 
 
 Research and development expenses were 42.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 52.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 9.4 million, or 18 . The decrease was primarily due to a 4.3 million decrease in salary and related personnel costs, a 3.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation, and a 1.7 million decrease in contractor and outside service provider fees. 
 Research and development expense as a percentage of revenue decreased from 24 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 19 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 General and administrative Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) General and administrative 41,136 61,129 (19,993) (33) Percentage of total revenue 18 28 
 General and administrative expenses were 41.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 61.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 20.0 million, or 33 . The decrease was primarily due to a 21.3 million decrease in litigation costs compared to those that occurred in the prior-year period and are out of the ordinary course of business, a 1.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation, and a 0.5 million decrease in lease-related impairment charges. These decreases were partially offset by a 2.4 increase in salary and related personnel costs and a 0.9 million net increase in acquisition-related costs. 
 General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased from 28 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 18 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Depreciation and amortization 31,165 31,919 (754) (2) Percentage of total revenue 14 14 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses were 31.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 31.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.8 million, or 2 . This decrease was primarily due to certain acquired intangible assets from our business combinations becoming fully amortized. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue remained constant at 14 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 .

Interest and other income (expense), net Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Interest income 13,135 11,968 1,167 10 Interest expense (9,789) (5,461) (4,328) 79 Other expense 
 (161) (17) (144) 847 Total interest and other income (expense), net 
 3,185 6,490 (3,305) (51) 
 
 Interest and other income (expense), net decreased 3.3 million, or 51 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change is primarily due to a 4.5 million increase in interest expense related to our new credit agreement with Silver Point Finance, partially offset by a 1.2 increase in interest income on our short-term investments, primarily due to higher market interest rates. 
 Income tax provision (benefit) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Income tax provision (benefit) 
 (292) 213 (505) (237) 
 
 Our income tax provision consists of current and deferred taxes for U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. As we have a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, our income tax provision typically consists primarily of minimal state and foreign income taxes, which is the case for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is due to a foreign deferred income tax benefit offset by minimal current state and foreign income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of 387.3 million, which were held for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and strategic transactions. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are comprised primarily of money market funds, U.S. treasury notes, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and U.S. agency securities. 
 Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily from the proceeds we received through private sales of equity securities, payments received from clients under technology and professional services arrangements, borrowings under our loan and security agreements (including our Credit Agreement described below), our IPO, the Note Offering, and the Secondary Public Equity Offering. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our pace of new client growth and expanded client relationships, technology and professional services renewal activity, and the timing and extent of spend to support the expansion of sales, marketing, development, share repurchases, and acquisition-related activities. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. 
 
 We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months, though we may require additional capital resources in the future. 
 Credit Agreement 
 On July 16, 2024 (the Closing Date), we entered into a credit agreement with Silver Point Finance, LLC as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders from time to time party thereto (Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement provides a five-year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 225 million, consisting of an initial term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 125 million, which was funded on the Closing Date, and a delayed draw term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 100 million, which was undrawn on the Closing Date. We have the option to draw up to 40 million under the delayed draw facility within six months after the Closing Date and up to an additional 60 million under the delayed draw facility within eighteen months after the Closing Date, in each case, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including a minimum liquidity threshold and a maximum recurring revenue ratio. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are expected to bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus 6.5 . Commencing with the quarter ending on December 31, 2024, we are required to make quarterly principal payments in an amount equal to 0.25 of the aggregate original principal amount. The final maturity date of the term loans is July 16, 2029. 
 
 We expect the net proceeds from the initial term loan to be used, together with cash on hand, (i) to repurchase, repay and/or pay amounts of cash due upon conversion of any or all of our Notes at any time on or prior to the maturity of the Notes and (ii) for working capital and general corporate purposes. The proceeds from the delayed draw term loan facility, if any, will be used to fund our inorganic growth strategy through permitted acquisitions (including deferred purchase price or similar arrangements related thereto) and to pay fees, costs, and expenses in connection therewith. 
 Refer to Note 10 Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details regarding the Credit Agreement. 
 Share repurchase plan 
 During the third quarter of 2022, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 40.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock (Share Repurchase Plan). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no shares repurchased. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and retired 145,027 shares of our common stock for 1.8 million at an average purchase price of 12.45 per share. The total remaining authorization for future shares of common stock repurchases under our Share Repurchase Plan is 29.8 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 67 

Convertible senior notes 
 On April 14, 2020, we issued 230.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50 Convertible Senior Notes due 2025, pursuant to an Indenture dated April 14, 2020, with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers. We received net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of 222.5 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and offering expenses payable by us. The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2020, at a rate of 2.50 per year. The Notes will mature on April 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, with the form of consideration determined at our election. The conversion rate is initially 32.6797 shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 30.60 per share of our common stock). 
 Capped calls 
 On April 8, 2020, concurrently with the pricing of the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (Base Capped Calls) with certain financial institutions, or option counterparties. In addition, in connection with the initial purchasers exercise in full of their option to purchase additional Notes, on April 9, 2020, we entered into additional capped call transactions (Additional Capped Calls, and, together with the Base Capped Calls, the Capped Calls) with each of the option counterparties. We used approximately 21.6 million of the net proceeds from the Note Offering to pay the option premium cost of the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of 42.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to the cap price. 
 Refer to Note 10 Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details regarding the private offering of the Notes and the Capped Calls. 
 Cash flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
 18,086 (14,039) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
 89,847 (9,624) Net cash provided by financing activities 
 114,056 2,335 Effect of exchange rate changes 62 (13) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 222,051 (21,341) 
 Operating activities 
 Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our clients for technology and professional services arrangements. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenses, marketing expenses, and technology costs. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 18.1 million, which included a net loss of 48.8 million. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of 31.2 million in depreciation and amortization, 29.3 million in stock-based compensation, 3.4 million from the provision for expected credit losses, and 2.2 million from lease-related impairment charges, offset by 3.9 million in net interest income from the accretion of discounts on our short-term investments. 
 
 68 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 14.0 million, which included a net loss of 87.8 million. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of 31.9 million in depreciation and amortization, 42.7 million in stock-based compensation, and 2.7 million from lease-related impairment charges, offset by 6.8 million in net interest income from the accretion of discounts on our short-term investments. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 89.8 million was primarily due to 206.5 million provided from the sale and maturity of short-term investments, reduced by 50.2 million in purchases of short-term investments, 54.9 million used in the acquisition of businesses, and 9.9 million of capitalized internal-use software development costs. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 9.6 million was primarily due to 256.1 million provided from the sale and maturity of short-term investments, reduced by 254.4 million in purchases of short-term investments, and 9.3 million of capitalized internal-use software development costs. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 114.1 million was primarily the result of 115.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of our Credit Agreement, net of issuance costs and 2.1 million in proceeds from our ESPP, reduced by 3.0 million for the deferred financing costs. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 2.3 million was primarily the result of 3.2 million in proceeds from our ESPP and 0.9 million in stock option exercise proceeds, reduced by 1.8 million in repurchases of common stock. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 There have been no material changes to the contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024 other than the new Credit Agreement entered into on July 16, 2024, as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section above and Note 10 Debt. 
 
 Refer to Note 10 Debt , and Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our commitments and contractual obligations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. 
 
 69 

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates. 
 Due to the high level of inflation, rising interest rates, and market volatility, amongst other factors, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require updates to our estimates or judgments or require us to revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. 
 Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We will continue to actively monitor the impact of the recent inflationary pressures, market volatility caused by bank failures, the challenging macroeconomic environment in general, and other factors on our estimates, including our expected credit losses, goodwill impairment assessments, and the fair value and/or recoverability of other assets. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. See Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding the Company s significant accounting policies.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates but may include foreign currency exchange risk and inflation in the future. 
 Interest rate risk 
 We had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of 387.3 million as of September 30, 2024, which are held primarily for working capital purposes. We do not make investments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our investments as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. 
 As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the value of our cash equivalents or investment portfolio. Fluctuations in the value of our cash equivalents and investment portfolio caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities prior to maturity. 
 On April 14, 2020, we issued 230.0 million in aggregate principal amount Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (Notes), in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers exempt from registration under the Securities Act (Note Offering). The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 2.50 , and, therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the values of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only. 
 On July 16, 2024, we entered into the Credit Agreement consisting of a 125 million funded term loan and a delayed draw term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 100 million, which was undrawn as of the Closing Date. The maturity date of the term loans is July 16, 2029. The interest that accrues on outstanding principal of the term loans is payable in cash on a quarterly basis, which portion accrues at a floating rate equal to SOFR plus 6.5 per year. In the event that SOFR is unavailable, interest will accrue at a floating rate equal to the alternate base rate (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus 5.5 per year. Commencing with the quarter ending on December 31, 2024, we are required to make quarterly principal payments in an amount equal to 0.25 of the aggregate original principal amount, and the final maturity date of the term loans is July 16, 2029. 
 
 In addition to the floating interest rate, we are required to pay a commitment fee on the unutilized commitments under the delayed draw facility ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 per year depending upon the year and the unutilized delayed draw term loan. 
 Interest rate risk also reflects our exposure to movements in interest rates associated with our borrowings. As of the time of this filing a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt. 

71 

Foreign currency exchange risk 
 Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is typically their local currency. Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the British Pound, Indian Rupee, and Singapore Dollar. Due to the relatively small size of our international operations to date, our foreign currency exposure has been fairly limited and not material to our business. Accordingly, we have not instituted a hedging program. We are considering the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and may in the future hedge balances and transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as we expand our international operations. 
 Today, our international sales contracts are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, while our international operating expenses are often denominated in local currencies. In the future, an increasing portion of our international sales contracts may be denominated in local currencies. Additionally, as we expand our international operations a larger portion of our operating expenses will be denominated in local currencies. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may affect our results of operations when translated into U.S. dollars. 
 Inflation risk 
 The recent high inflationary environment has adversely affected workforces, organizations, governments, clients, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours. 
 Our health system end market is currently experiencing meaningful financial strain from significant inflation with increases in labor and supply costs without a commensurate increase in revenue, leading to significant margin pressure. Although we are unable to determine the exact impact of inflation on our clients and on our business, we continue to monitor and assess the impact of inflationary pressures on our business operations. If our costs, including labor costs, were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures on an ongoing basis, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs by increasing fees for our Solution. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 72 

Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Part II. Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are, and from time to time may be, party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. As our growth continues, we may become party to an increasing number of litigation matters and claims. The outcome of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and the resolution of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. We are not presently party to any other legal proceedings that in the opinion of management, if determined to adversely affect us, may individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. 
 For information regarding a legal proceeding that was dismissed with prejudice on June 20, 2023, refer to Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section of this report titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our financial statements and related notes. If any of the events described in the following risk factors and the risks described elsewhere in this report occurs, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this report. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and results of operations will be harmed. 
 
 The market for healthcare solutions is intensely competitive. We compete across various segments within the healthcare market, including with respect to data analytics and technology platforms, healthcare consulting, care management and coordination, population health management, and health information exchange. Competition in our market involves rapidly changing technologies, evolving regulatory requirements and industry expectations, frequent new product introductions, and changes in client requirements. If we are unable to keep pace with the evolving needs of our clients and continue to develop and introduce new applications and services in a timely and efficient manner, demand for our Solution may be reduced and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. 
 We face competition from industry-agnostic analytics companies, electronic health record (EHR) companies, such as Epic Systems and Cerner, point solution vendors, and healthcare organizations that perform their own analytics. These competitors include large, well-financed, and technologically sophisticated entities. Some of our current large competitors, such as Optum Analytics and IBM, have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, significantly greater resources than we do, and/or more established distribution networks and relationships with healthcare providers. As a result, our current and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or client requirements. In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products or services to increase the availability of their products or services to the marketplace. Current or future competitors may consolidate to improve the breadth of their products, directly competing with our Solution. Accordingly, new competitors may emerge that have greater market share, larger client bases, greater breadth and volume of data, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, broader offerings, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources, and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. 
 
 74 

Further, in light of these advantages, even if our Solution is more effective than the product or service offerings of our competitors, current or potential clients might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our Solution. We face competition from niche vendors, who offer stand-alone products and services, and from existing enterprise vendors, including those currently focused on software products, which have information systems in place with clients in our target markets. These existing enterprise vendors may now, or in the future, offer or promise products or services with less functionality than our Solution, but offer ease of integration with existing systems and that leverage existing vendor relationships. Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability, or market share. 
 Our patient engagement, population health, and care coordination services face competition from a wide variety of market participants. For example, certain health systems have developed their own population health and care coordination systems. If we fail to distinguish our offerings from the other options available to healthcare providers, the demand for and market share of those offerings may decrease. 
 Changes in the healthcare industry could affect the demand for our Solution, cause our existing contracts to be terminated, and negatively impact the process of negotiating future contracts. 
 
 As the healthcare industry evolves, changes in our client and vendor bases may reduce the demand for our Solution, result in the termination of existing contracts or certain services provided under existing contracts, and make it more difficult to negotiate new contracts on terms that are acceptable to us. For example, the increasing market share of EHR companies in data analytic services at hospital systems may cause our existing clients to terminate contracts with us in order to engage EHR companies to provide these services. Similarly, client and vendor consolidation results in fewer, larger entities with increased bargaining power and the ability to demand terms that are unfavorable to us. If these trends continue, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain or expand our client base, negotiate contracts with acceptable terms, or maintain our current pricing structure, and our revenue may decrease. 
 
 General reductions in expenditures by healthcare organizations, or reductions in such expenditures within market segments that we serve, could have similar impacts with regard to our Solution. Such reductions may result from, among other things, reduced governmental funding for healthcare; a decrease in the number of, or the market exclusivity available to, new drugs coming to market; or adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payors or providers, the pharmaceutical industry, or other healthcare companies that purchase our services (e.g., changes in the design of health plans). In addition, changes in government regulation of the healthcare industry could potentially negatively impact our existing and future contracts. Any of these changes could reduce the purchase of our Solution by such clients, reducing our revenue and possibly requiring us to materially revise our offerings. In addition, our clients expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to our Solution. 
 
 Macroeconomic challenges (including high inflationary and/or high interest rate environments, or market volatility caused by bank failures and measures taken in response thereto), the tight labor market, and any new public health crisis could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Recent macroeconomic challenges (including high inflationary and/or high interest rate environments), and the tight labor market continue to adversely affect workforces, organizations, governments, clients, economies, and financial markets globally and have disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including our business. These factors have and could further decrease healthcare industry spending, adversely affect demand for our Solution, cause one or more of our clients to file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business, cause one or more of our clients to fail to renew, terminate, or renegotiate their contracts, impact expected spending from new clients, negatively impact collections of accounts receivable, and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Further, the sales cycle for a new DOS Subscription Client, which we estimate to typically be approximately one year, could lengthen, as we experienced in 2022 and 2023, resulting in a potentially longer delay between increasing operating expenses and the generation of corresponding revenue, if any. 
 
 75 

We cannot predict with any certainty whether and to what degree the disruption caused by any new public health crisis, the high inflationary environment, rising interest rates, market volatility caused by bank failures and measures taken in response thereto, and reactions to any of the foregoing will continue and expect to face difficulty accurately predicting our internal financial forecasts. Further, it is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of public health crises, and macroeconomic challenges (including the high inflationary and/or high interest rate environments), and their effects on our business, results of operations, or financial condition at this time. Further, market volatility as a result of future failures of financial institutions, similar to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, could lead to market-wide liquidity shortages, impair the ability of companies to access near-term working capital needs and create additional market and economic uncertainty. In the event of a failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our business and financial position. 
 
 We may be unable to successfully execute on our growth initiatives, business strategies, or operating plans, as well as cost reduction and restructuring initiatives. 
 We are continually executing a number of growth initiatives, strategies, and operating plans designed to enhance our business, as well as some cost reduction and restructuring initiatives. We may not be able to successfully complete these growth initiatives, strategies, operating plans, and cost reduction and restructuring initiatives, and realize all of the benefits, including growth targets and cost savings, that we expect to achieve or it may be more costly to do so than we anticipate. For example, the migration of existing DOS Subscription Clients to Health Catalyst Ignite involves risk and may cause disruptions to our Solution, difficulties as clients acclimate to a new platform, or other challenges that could impair our clients use of our technology, any of which could lead to client dissatisfaction and non-renewals. Further, costs associated with the transition to Health Catalyst Ignite have and may continue to result in higher cost of technology revenue, which may not decrease over time 
 
 A variety of factors could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits of our growth initiatives, strategies, operating plans or cost reduction and restructuring initiatives. These factors include, among others, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to such growth initiatives, strategies, operating plans, and cost reduction and restructuring initiatives, increased difficulty and cost in implementing these efforts, including difficulties in complying with new regulatory requirements and the incurrence of other unexpected costs associated with operating the business. 
 
 For example, on October 31, 2023, our board of directors authorized the 2023 Restructuring Plan as part of a restructuring plan intended to optimize our cost structure and focus our investment of resources in key priority areas to align with strategic changes. The 2023 Restructuring Plan reduced our global workforce by approximately 10 during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. We may incur additional expenses not currently contemplated due to events associated with the 2023 Restructuring, such as costs in connection with attrition beyond our intended reduction in force, the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, or other unforeseen difficulties, delays, or other impacts on other areas of our liabilities and obligations, in each case which could result in losses in future periods or which could otherwise prevent us from realizing, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits and savings from the 2023 Restructuring Plan. 
 Our continued implementation of the 2023 Restructuring Plan or any other programs may disrupt our operations and performance. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will realize these benefits. If, for any reason, the benefits we realize are less than our estimates or the implementation of these growth initiatives, strategies, operating plans, and cost reduction and restructuring initiatives adversely affect our operations or cost more or take longer to effectuate than we expect, or if our assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 

76 

If we fail to provide effective professional services and high-quality client support, our business and reputation would suffer. 
 Our professional services and high-quality, ongoing client support are important to the successful marketing and sale of our products and services and for the renewal of existing client agreements. Providing these services and support requires that our professional services and support personnel have healthcare, technical, and other knowledge and expertise, making it difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and scale our professional services and support operations. The demand on our client support organization will increase as we expand our business and pursue new clients, and such increased support could require us to devote significant development services and support personnel, which could strain our team and infrastructure and reduce our profit margins. If we do not help our clients quickly resolve any post-implementation issues and provide effective ongoing client support, our ability to sell additional products and services to existing and future clients could suffer and our reputation would be harmed. 
 Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require a considerable investment of time and expense. If our sales cycle lengthens or we invest substantial resources pursuing unsuccessful sales opportunities, our results of operations and growth would be harmed. 
 Our sales process entails planning discussions with prospective clients, analyzing their existing solutions, and identifying how these potential clients can use and benefit from our Solution. The sales cycle for a new DOS Subscription Client, from the time of prospect qualification to the completion of the first sale, we estimate to typically be approximately one year and in some cases has exceeded two years. We spend substantial time, effort, and money in our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will result in the sale of our Solution. 
 In addition, our sales cycle and timing of sales can vary substantially from client to client because of various factors, including the discretionary nature of potential clients purchasing and budget decisions, the announcement or planned introduction of new analytics applications or services by us or our competitors, and the purchasing approval processes of potential clients. Further, the sales cycles of certain Solutions with a more limited operating history, such as TEMS, can be more difficult to predict and, at times, longer than our typical sales cycle. If our sales cycle lengthens, as we experienced in 2022 and 2023, or we invest substantial resources pursuing unsuccessful sales opportunities, our results of operations and growth would be harmed. 
 Our Solution may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. 
 Proprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex. Unforeseen difficulties can arise. We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we will discover additional problems that prevent our applications from operating properly. If our systems do not function reliably or fail to meet user or client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert liability claims against us or attempt to cancel their contracts with us, and users of our software could choose to cease their use of our Solution. This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or retain clients. 
 Information services as complex as those we offer have, in the past, contained, and may in the future develop or contain, undetected defects, vulnerabilities, or errors. We cannot be assured that material performance problems or defects in our software or software provided by our vendors will not arise in the future. Errors may result from sources beyond our control, including the receipt, entry, or interpretation of patient information; the interface of our software with legacy systems or vendor systems that we did not develop; or errors in data provided by third parties. Despite testing, defects or errors may arise in our existing or new software or service processes following introduction to the market. 
 Clients rely on our Solution to collect, manage, and report clinical, financial, and operational data, and to provide timely and accurate information regarding medical treatment and care delivery patterns. They may have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than clients of software products in general. Clinicians may also refer to our predictive models for care delivery prioritization, and to inform treatment protocols. 
 
 77 

Limitations of liability and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages related to defects in our software or content which we may include in our subscription and services agreements may not be enforced by a court or other tribunal or otherwise effectively protect us from related claims. In most cases, we maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions. However, it is possible that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. 
 In light of this, defects, vulnerabilities, and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share; liability to clients, clinicians, their patients, or others; failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion; diversion of development and management resources; delays in the introduction of new services; injury to our reputation; and increased service and maintenance costs. Defects, vulnerabilities, or errors in our software and service processes might discourage existing or potential clients from purchasing services from us. Correction of defects, vulnerabilities, or errors could prove to be impossible or impractical. The costs incurred in correcting any defects, vulnerabilities, or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 If we are not able to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition, our business and results of operations will be harmed. 
 We believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand recognition is critical to our relationships with existing clients and to our ability to attract new clients. The promotion of our brands may require us to make substantial investments and we anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, these marketing initiatives may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Our marketing activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue, and to the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, the increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur and our results of operations could be harmed. 
 
 In addition, any factor that diminishes our reputation or that of our management, including failing to meet the expectations of our clients, or any adverse publicity surrounding one of our investors or clients, could make it substantially more difficult for us to attract new clients. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition, our business may not grow and we could lose our relationships with clients, which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 If we do not continue to innovate and provide services that are useful to clients and users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenue and results of operations could suffer. 
 
 The market for healthcare in the United States is in the early stages of structural change and is rapidly evolving, including towards a more value-based care model. Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated client and user requirements, and sustain market acceptance. Our future financial performance will depend in part on growth in this market and on our ability to adapt to emerging demands of this market, including adapting to the ways our clients or users access and use our Solution. Although we have built several new software analytics applications in the last few years, we may not be able to sustain this rate of innovation and/or the new software analytics applications may not meet the evolving needs of our clients. Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our clients or users. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing services and applications, and introduce new high-quality services and applications that clients will want, while offering our Solution at competitive prices. If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to maintain and improve our Solution on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may lose clients and users. Our results of operations would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our clients, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market, including as the result of delayed releases or releases that are ineffective or have errors or defects. As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to, or better than, those generated by our Solution. This may force us to compete on additional service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. 
 
 78 

Our business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our Solution. 
 We depend on client satisfaction to succeed with respect to our Solution. Our sales organization is dependent on the quality of our offerings, our business reputation, and the strong recommendations from existing clients. If our Solution does not function reliably or fails to meet client expectations in terms of performance and availability, clients could assert claims against us, terminate their contracts with us or publish negative feedback. This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or retain clients. Furthermore, we provide professional services to clients to support their use of our Solution and to achieve measurable clinical, financial, and operational improvements. Any failure to maintain high-quality professional services, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality professional services, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our Solution to existing and prospective clients, and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 If our existing clients do not continue or renew their contracts with us, renew at lower fee levels, or decline to purchase additional technology and services from us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from the renewal of existing client contracts and sales of additional technology and services to existing clients. As part of our growth strategy, for instance, we have recently focused on expanding our Solution among current clients, including Solutions with a more limited operating history, such as TEMS. As a result, selling additional technology and services is critical to our future business, revenue growth, and results of operations. Factors that may affect our ability to sell additional technology and services include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 the price, performance, and functionality of our Solution; 
 the availability, price, performance, and functionality of competing solutions; 
 our ability to develop and sell complementary technology and services; 
 the stability, performance, and security of our hosting infrastructure and hosting services; 
 our ability to continuously deliver measurable improvements; 
 health systems demand for professional services to augment their internal data analytics function; 
 changes in healthcare laws, regulations, or trends; 
 the business environment of our clients and, in particular, our clients financial performance and headcount reductions by our clients; and 
 the impact of macroeconomic challenges, including the impact of high inflationary and/or high interest rate environments, market volatility caused by bank failures and measures taken in response thereto, the tight labor market, and the impact of any natural disasters or public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, upon our clients. 
 We generally enter into subscription contracts with our clients for access to our Solution. Many of these contracts have initial terms of one to three years. Most of our clients have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our Solution after the initial term expires. Although we have long-term contracts with many clients, these contracts may be terminated by the client (generally, subject to providing us with prior notice before their term expires) for convenience or for certain specified reasons, including changes in the regulatory landscape, loss of certain third-party licenses, breach of our contractual obligations, including poor performance by us in areas that include repeated failures by us to provide specified levels of service over certain performance periods, or dissatisfaction with changes in our Solution, such as the deployment of Health Catalyst Ignite and the migration of existing DOS Subscription Clients thereto. 
 
 79 

We expect that future contracts will contain similar provisions. If any of our contracts with our clients are terminated, we may not be able to recover all fees due under the terminated contract and we will lose future revenue from that client, which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our clients may negotiate terms less advantageous to us upon renewal, which may reduce our revenue from these clients. Our future results of operations also depend, in part, on our ability to upgrade and enhance our Solution. If our clients fail to renew their contracts, renew their contracts upon less favorable terms, or at lower fee levels or fail to purchase new technology and services from us, our revenue may decline or our future revenue growth may be constrained. 
 
 Our results of operations have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of an investment in our common stock could decline substantially. 
 Our results of operations are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. Some of the factors that could cause our financial performance and results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: 
 the extent to which our Solution achieves or maintains market acceptance; 
 our ability to introduce new applications, updates, and enhancements to our existing applications on a timely basis; 
 new competitors and the introduction of enhanced products and services from new or existing competitors; 
 the length of our contracting and implementation cycles and our fulfillment periods for our Solution; 
 the mix of revenue generated from professional services as compared to technology subscriptions; 
 clients reducing or eliminating their spend with us in response to macroeconomic factors or otherwise; 
 the financial condition of our current and future clients; 
 changes in client budgets and procurement policies; 
 changes in regulations or marketing strategies; 
 the impact of macroeconomic challenges, including the high inflationary and/or high interest rate environments, market volatility caused by bank failures and measures taken in response thereto, and public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on our clients, partners, and business; 
 the amount and timing of our investment in research and development activities; 
 the amount and timing of our investment in sales and marketing activities; 
 technical difficulties or interruptions to our Solution, including related to updates to our technology or technology migrations, in particular, those related to our migration of existing DOS Subscription Clients to Health Catalyst Ignite; 
 our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel; 
 changes in the regulatory environment related to healthcare; 
 regulatory compliance costs; 
 
 80 

the timing, size, and integration success of potential future acquisitions; 
 unforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs; and 
 buying patterns of our clients and the related seasonality impacts on our business. 
 Many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our results of operations to vary widely. For example, we have experienced, and expect that we will continue to experience, seasonality in the number of new clients that subscribe to our Solution; specifically, new clients (DOS Subscription Clients in particular) tend to subscribe to our Solution at higher rates in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Seasonality in our business may cause period-to-period fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics, and thus limit our ability to predict our future results. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. 
 A significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature in the short term, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue and profitability. Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls, lower-than-expected revenue increases as a result of planned expenditures, and longer-than-expected impact on profitability and margins as a result of planned expenditures may decrease our gross margins and profitability and could cause significant changes in our results of operations from quarter to quarter. In addition, our future quarterly results of operations may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time. 
 Our pricing may change over time and our ability to efficiently price our Solution will affect our results of operations and our ability to attract or retain clients. 
 In the past, we have adjusted our prices as a result of offering new applications and services and client demand. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we began to introduce new pricing for our Solution to new clients and, in 2015, we introduced our subscription model, in each case, the full effect of which we expected would be realized in future years. While we determine our prices based on prior experience, feedback from clients, and other factors and information, our assessments may not be accurate and we could be underpricing or overpricing our Solution, which may require us to continue to adjust our pricing model. Furthermore, as our applications and services change, then we may need to, or choose to, revise our pricing as our prior experience in those areas will be limited. Such changes to our pricing model or our inability to efficiently price our Solution could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition and impact our ability to predict our future performance. 
 If our Solution fails to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of our Solution is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could have liability to clients, clinicians, patients, or others, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our Solution may be used by clients to support clinical decision-making by providers and interpret information about patient medical histories, treatment plans, medical conditions, and the use of particular medications. If our Solution is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, then clients or their patients could assert claims against us that could result in substantial costs to us, harm our reputation in the industry, and cause demand for our Solution to decline. In addition, our analytics services may be used by our clients to inform clinical decision-making, provide access to patient medical histories, and assist in creating patient treatment plans. Therefore, if data analyses are presented incorrectly in our Solution or they are incomplete, or if we make mistakes in the capture or input of these data, adverse consequences, including death, may occur and give rise to product liability, medical malpractice liability, and other claims against us by clients, clinicians, patients, or others. We often have little control over data accuracy, yet a court or government agency may take the position that our storage and display of health information exposes us to personal injury liability or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information. 
 
 81 

Our clinical guidelines, algorithms, and protocols may be viewed as providing healthcare professionals with guidance on care management, care coordination, or treatment decisions. If our content, or content we obtain from third parties, contains inaccuracies, or we introduce inaccuracies in the process of implementing third-party content, it is possible that patients, clinicians, consumers, the providers of the third-party content, or others may sue us if they are harmed as a result of such inaccuracies. We cannot assure you that our software development, editorial, and other quality control procedures will be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in any particular content or our software or algorithms. 
 The assertion of such claims and ensuing litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management s attention from operations, damage our reputation, and decrease market acceptance of our Solution. We attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages, have our clients assume responsibility for clinical treatment, diagnoses, medical oversight, and dosing decisions, and require that our clients assume responsibility for medical care and approve key algorithms, clinical guidelines, clinical protocols, content, and data. Despite these precautions, the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable, be binding upon patients, or otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Furthermore, general liability and errors and omissions insurance coverage and medical malpractice liability coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us. In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. One or more large claims could exceed our available insurance coverage. If any of these events occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 Although we carry insurance covering medical malpractice claims in amounts that we believe are appropriate in light of the risks attendant to our business, successful medical liability claims could result in substantial damage awards that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage. In addition, professional liability insurance is expensive and insurance premiums may increase significantly in the future, particularly as we expand our Solution. As a result, adequate professional liability insurance may not be available to our providers or to us in the future at acceptable costs or at all. 
 Any claims made against us that are not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend against, result in substantial damage awards against us, and divert the attention of our management and our providers from our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any claims may adversely affect our business or reputation. 
 Future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could result in additional liabilities. 
 
 We may from time to time be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients or vendors in connection with commercial disputes, litigation related to intellectual property, and employment claims made by our current or former employees. Claims may also be asserted by or on behalf of a variety of other parties, including government agencies, patients or vendors of our clients, or stockholders. Any litigation involving us may result in substantial costs, operationally restrict our business, and may divert management s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 Insurance may not cover existing or future claims, be sufficient to fully compensate us for one or more of such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our results of operations and resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock. 

82 

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from our largest clients. The loss, termination, or renegotiation of any contract could negatively impact our results. 
 
 Historically, we have relied on a limited number of clients for a significant portion of our total revenue and accounts receivable. Our three largest clients during 2023 comprised 5.5 , 3.6 , and 3.5 of our revenue, or 12.6 in the aggregate. Our three largest clients during 2022 comprised 4.1 , 3.7 , and 3.4 of our revenue, or 11.2 in the aggregate. The sudden loss of any of our largest clients or the renegotiation of any of our largest client contracts could adversely affect our results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, we engage in active discussions and renegotiations with our clients in respect of our Solution and the terms of our client agreements, including our fees. As our clients businesses respond to market dynamics and financial pressures, and as our clients make strategic business decisions in respect of the lines of business they pursue and programs in which they participate, we expect that certain of our clients will, from time to time, seek to restructure their agreements with us. 
 
 In the ordinary course, we renegotiate the terms of our agreements with our clients in connection with renewals or extensions of these agreements. These discussions and future discussions could result in reductions to the fees and changes to the scope of services contemplated by our original client contracts and consequently could negatively impact our revenue, business, and prospects. 
 
 Because we rely on a limited number of clients for a significant portion of our revenue, we depend on the creditworthiness of these clients. Our clients are subject to a number of risks including reductions in payment rates from governmental payors, higher than expected healthcare costs, and lack of predictability of financial results when entering new lines of business. If the financial condition of our clients declines, our credit risk could increase. Should one or more of our significant clients declare bankruptcy, be declared insolvent, or otherwise be restricted by state or federal laws or regulation from continuing in some or all of their operations, this could adversely affect our ongoing revenue, the collectability of our accounts receivable, our bad debt reserves and net income. 
 
 Because we generally recognize technology and professional services revenue ratably over the term of the contract for our services, a significant downturn in our business may not be reflected immediately in our results of operations, which increases the difficulty of evaluating our future financial performance. 
 
 We generally recognize technology and professional services revenue ratably over the term of a contract. As a result, a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from contracts entered into during prior periods. Consequently, a decline in new contracts in any quarter may not affect our results of operations in that quarter but could reduce our revenue in future quarters. Additionally, the timing of renewals or non-renewals of a contract during any quarter may only affect our financial performance in future quarters. For example, the non-renewal of a subscription agreement late in a quarter will have minimal impact on revenue for that quarter but will reduce our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in sales may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations, which would make these reported results less indicative of our future financial results. By contrast, a non-renewal occurring early in a quarter may have a significant negative impact on revenue for that quarter and we may not be able to offset a decline in revenue due to non-renewal with revenue from new contracts entered into in the same quarter. In addition, we may be unable to quickly adjust our costs in response to reduced revenue. 
 If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. 
 As a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 We are also required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Many of the internal controls we have implemented pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are process controls with respect to which a material weakness may be found whether or not any error has been identified in our reported financial statements. This may be confusing to investors and result in damage to our 
 
 83 

reputation, which may harm our business. Additionally, the proper design and assessment of internal controls over financial reporting are subject to varying interpretations, and, as a result, application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies and as common practices evolve. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding the proper design and assessment of internal controls over financial reporting and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to internal controls. We must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting. If in the future we have any material weaknesses, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. 
 Additionally, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. 
 We may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management s attention, result in dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and we may have difficulty integrating any such acquisitions successfully or realizing the anticipated benefits therefrom, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We may seek to acquire or invest in businesses, applications, services, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our Solution, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. We have in the past and may in the future have difficulty integrating acquired businesses. During 2020 we acquired Able Health, Healthfinch, and Vitalware, during 2021 we acquired Twistle, during 2022 we acquired ARMUS and KPI Ninja, during 2023 we acquired ERS, and during 2024 we acquired Carevive and Lumeon. We may have difficulty cross-selling our Solution to acquired clients, and we may have difficulty integrating, or incur integration-related costs associated with, newly acquired team members. 
 We have limited experience in acquiring other businesses. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations, and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner; 
 unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition; 
 difficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations, and personnel of the acquired business; 
 difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business; 
 difficulty converting the clients of the acquired business onto our DOS platform and contract terms, including disparities in the revenue, licensing, support, or professional services model of the acquired business; 
 diversion of management s attention from other business concerns; 
 adverse effects on our existing business relationships with business partners and clients as a result of the acquisition; 
 the potential loss of key employees; 
 
 84 

use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and 
 use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition. 
 In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If our acquisitions do not yield expected returns or fair value estimates deteriorate, we may be required to take charges to our results of operations based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may suffer. Also, the anticipated benefit of any acquisition may not materialize or may be prohibited by contractual obligations we may enter into in the future with lenders or other third parties. Additionally, future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. We cannot predict the number, timing, or size of future acquisitions, or the effect that any such transactions might have on our results of operations. 
 Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our continued growth. 
 To continue to execute on our growth and operating plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and we may modify our compensation program and practices for our team members. Competition for such personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and software engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing applications and consulting and analytics services. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, including due to changes to our compensation program or practices. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. For example, the 2023 Restructuring Plan and other restructurings may result in attrition beyond our intended reduction in force or may adversely impact our ability to recruit and hire qualified personnel in the future. In addition, our search for replacements for departed employees may cause uncertainty regarding the future of our business, impact employee hiring and retention, and adversely impact our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they may receive in connection with their employment. Volatility in the price of our stock or failure to obtain stockholder approval for increases in the number of shares available for grant under our equity plans may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. 
 
 We depend on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our business. 
 Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers and recruitment of additional highly skilled employees. From time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. Several of our senior leaders are active members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. There is a risk that in the future, one or more of these individuals could receive a call to serve in a full-time capacity for the church, which has already occurred, including with our former Chief Operating Officer, Paul Horstmeier, who stepped down from his role of Chief Operating Officer effective March 31, 2023. Hiring executives with needed skills or the replacement of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees would likely involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. 
 In addition, competition for qualified management in our industry is intense. Many of the companies with which we compete for management personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do. We have not entered into term-based employment agreements with our executive officers. All of our employees are at-will employees, and their employment can be terminated by us or them at any time, for any reason. The departure of key personnel 
 
 85 

could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our business, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to employ a suitable replacement for the departing individual, or that a replacement could be hired on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may affect our ability to attract replacements should key personnel depart. If we are not able to retain any of our key management personnel, our business could be harmed. 
 Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity, and teamwork fostered by our culture, which could harm our business. 
 We believe that our corporate culture has been an important contributor to our success, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork, and passion for providing high levels of client satisfaction. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a growing number of new employees. As a result, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture, which could limit our ability to innovate and operate effectively. Any failure to preserve our culture could also negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, maintain our performance, or execute on our business strategy. 
 If we fail to effectively manage our growth and organizational change, our business and results of operations could be harmed. 
 We have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth and organizational change, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational, and financial resources. In addition, if we fail to successfully integrate new team members or fail to effectively manage organizational changes, it could harm our culture, business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the expense reduction measures taken in connection with the 2023 Restructuring Plan may result in unintended consequences and costs, including costs associated with attrition beyond our intended reduction in force, a decrease in morale among team members following the completion of the 2023 Restructuring Plan, adverse impacts in our ability to recruit and hire qualified personnel in the future, and the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, which could result in losses in future periods or otherwise prevent us from realizing, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits and savings from the 2023 Restructuring Plan. In addition, we must continue to maintain, and may need to enhance, our information technology infrastructure and financial and accounting systems and controls, as well as manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations, which may include offshore and near shore, which will place additional demands on our resources and operations. We also must attract, train, and retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, service offering personnel, and management personnel. At times, this will require us to invest in and commit significant financial, operational, and management resources to grow and change in these areas without undermining the corporate culture that has been critical to our growth so far. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or organizational changes, or if the realization of these benefits is delayed, our results of operations may be adversely affected. If we fail to provide effective client training on our Solution and high-quality client support, our business and reputation could suffer. 
 Failure to effectively manage our growth or organizational changes could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in technology and operations; result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls; give rise to operational mistakes, losses, or loss of productivity or business opportunities; reduce client or user satisfaction; limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures; and result in loss of team members and reduced productivity of remaining team members. Our growth or organizational changes could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources and management attention from other projects, such as the development of new or enhanced services or the acquisition of suitable businesses or technologies. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth or organizational changes, our expenses may increase more than expected, cost savings may not be realized, our revenue could decline or may grow more slowly than expected, and we may be unable to implement our business strategy, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may not grow at the rates we historically have achieved or at all, even if our key metrics may indicate growth. 
 
 86 

We have experienced periods of significant growth, including in the last five years. At times, our growth has moderated. Future revenue may not grow at the same rates experienced during times of significant growth or may decline. Further, larger revenue opportunities that include portions of our Solution with less operating history could cause our growth to become less predictable and/or choppier relative to prior periods. Our future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our revenue from existing clients, to complete sales to potential future clients, to expand our client and member bases, to prevent churn of existing clients, and to develop new solutions. 
 Our future growth may also be driven by expansion into adjacent markets and/or international expansion. We can provide no assurances that we will be successful in executing on these growth strategies or that we will continue to grow our revenue or to generate net income. Our historical results may not be indicative of future performance. Our ability to execute on our existing sales pipeline, create additional sales pipelines, and expand our client base depends on, among other things, the attractiveness of our Solution relative to those offered by our competitors, our ability to demonstrate the value of our existing and future services, and our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales and marketing leadership and support personnel. In addition, our existing clients may be slower to adopt our Solution than we currently anticipate, which could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects. 
 Our estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, our business may not grow at similar rates, or at all. 
 Our market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates which may not prove to be accurate. The estimates and forecasts relating to the size and expected growth of our target market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business may not grow at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. 
 Risks Related to Data and Intellectual Property 
 
 Failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business. 
 We require our clients to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so. If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be restricted or prohibited by state, federal, or international privacy or data protection laws, or other related privacy and data protection laws. This could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent the use of such data, including our ability to provide such data to third parties that are incorporated into our service offerings. Furthermore, this may cause us to breach obligations to third parties to whom we may provide such data, such as third-party service or technology providers that are incorporated into our service offerings. In addition, this could interfere with or prevent data sourcing, data analyses, or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us. 
 Moreover, we may be subject to claims, civil and/or criminal liability or government or state attorneys general investigations for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission, or waiver. These claims, liabilities or government or state attorneys general investigations could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

87 

Our business and operations may suffer in the event of information technology system failures, cyberattacks, or deficiencies in our cybersecurity. 
 Our Solution involves the storage and transmission of our clients proprietary information, including personal or identifying information regarding patients and their protected health information (PHI). Despite the implementation of security measures, our information technology systems and those of our clients, contractors, consultants, and collaborators are vulnerable to attack, damage and interruption from cyberattacks, phishing attacks, computer viruses and malware (e.g., ransomware), natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, employee theft or misuse, human error, fraud, denial or degradation of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors or unauthorized access or use by persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication, and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. 
 We may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Further, political and international uncertainty, competition and disputes, including the war involving Russia and Ukraine, could create tension that results in cyber-attacks or cybersecurity incidents that could either directly or indirectly impact our operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. 
 Moreover, the detection, prevention, and remediation of known or unknown security vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software, may result in additional direct or indirect costs and management time. Even if identified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. As a result, unauthorized access or security breaches as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise could result in the loss or inappropriate use of information, litigation, indemnity obligations, damage to our reputation, and other liability such as government or state Attorney General investigations. 
 We and certain of our service providers are from time to time subject to cyberattacks and security incidents. While we do not believe that we have experienced any significant system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could adversely affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to elect to not renew their subscriptions, result in reputational damage, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines, mandatory disclosures, or other action or liability, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for liability that may be imposed or the losses associated with such events, and in any case, such insurance may not cover all of the specific costs, expenses, and losses we could incur in responding to and remediating a security breach. A security breach of another significant provider of cloud-based solutions may also negatively impact the demand for our Solution. 
 Our Solution is dependent on our ability to source data from third parties, and such third parties could take steps to block our access to data, or increase fees or impose fees for such access, which could impair our ability to provide our Solution, limit the effectiveness of our Solution or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our data platform requires us to source data from multiple clinical, financial, and operational data sources, which sources are also typically third-party vendors of our clients. The functioning of our analytics applications and our ability to perform analytics services is predicated on our ability to establish interfaces that download the relevant data from these source systems on a repeated basis and in a reliable manner. We may encounter vendors that engage in information blocking practices that may inhibit our ability to access the relevant data on behalf of clients or impose new or additional costs. 
 
 88 

In 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services promulgated final rules to support access, exchange, and use of electronic health information (EHI), referred to as the Final Rule. The Final Rule is intended to clarify provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act regarding interoperability and information blocking, and, subject to the interpretations of the Final Rule, and exceptions to what constitutes information blocking, may create significant new requirements for healthcare industry participants. The Final Rule requires certain electronic health record technology to incorporate standardized application programming interfaces to allow individuals to securely and easily access structured EHI using smartphone applications, provides patients with certain rights to electronic access to their EHI (structured and/or unstructured) at no cost and implements the information blocking provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act, subject to eight exceptions that will not be considered information blocking as long as specific conditions are met. In April 2023, the ONC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would modify certain components of the Final Rule, including modifying and expanding certain exceptions to the information blocking regulations, which are intended to support information sharing. The impact of the Final Rule on our business is unclear at this time, due to, among other things, uncertainty regarding the interpretation of safe harbors and exceptions to the Final Rule by industry participants and regulators. 
 
 The Final Rule focuses on health plans, payors, and healthcare providers and proposes measures to enable patients to move from health plan to health plan, provider to provider, and have both their clinical and administrative information travel with them. It is unclear whether the Final Rule may benefit us in that certain EHR vendors will no longer be permitted to interfere with our attempts at integration, but the rules may also make it easier for other similar companies to enter the market, creating increased competition, and reducing our market share. It is unclear at this time what the costs of compliance with the proposed rules, if adopted, would be, and what additional risks there may be to our business. If we face limitations on the development of data interfaces and other information blocking practices, including the imposition of increased fees, our data access and ability to download relevant data may be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to provide our Solution as effectively as possible. Any steps we take to enforce the anti-information blocking provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act could be costly, could distract management attention from the business, and could have uncertain results. 
 
 We rely on third-party providers, including Microsoft Azure, for computing infrastructure, network connectivity, and other technology-related services needed to deliver our Solution. Any disruption in the services provided by such third-party providers could adversely affect our business and subject us to liability. 
 Our Solution is generally hosted from and uses computing infrastructure provided by third parties, including Microsoft Azure and other computing infrastructure service providers. We have migrated and expect to continue to migrate a significant portion of our DOS and analytics application computing infrastructure needs to Microsoft Azure. We have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in transitioning DOS clients from our own managed data center to Microsoft Azure and the migration of clients to the next iteration of our DOS platform. We anticipate that this transition will increase the cost of hosting our technology and negatively impact our technology gross margin. Such migrations are risky and may cause disruptions to our Solution, service outages, downtime, or other problems and may increase our costs. Despite precautions taken during such transitions, any unsuccessful transition of technology may impair clients use of our technology which may cause greater costs or downtime and which may lead to, among other things, client dissatisfaction and non-renewals. 
 Our computing infrastructure service providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our computing infrastructure service providers is acquired, we may be required to transition to a new provider and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. Problems faced by our computing infrastructure service providers, including those operated by Microsoft, could adversely affect the experience of our clients. Microsoft Azure and other infrastructure vendors have had and may in the future experience significant service outages. Additionally, if our computing infrastructure service providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity, this could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, a rapid expansion of our business could affect our service levels or cause our third-party hosted systems to fail. Our agreements with third-party computing infrastructure service providers may not entitle us to service level credits that correspond with those we offer to our clients. 
 
 89 

Any changes in third-party service levels at our computing infrastructure service providers, or any related disruptions or performance problems with our Solution, could adversely affect our reputation and may damage our clients data, information and/or stored files, result in lengthy interruptions in our services, or result in potential losses of client data. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue refunds to clients for prepaid and unused subscriptions, subject us to service level credit claims and potential liability, allow our clients to terminate their contracts with us, or adversely affect our renewal rates. 
 We rely on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties, and our own systems for providing our Solution to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation, potentially require us to issue credits to our clients, and negatively impact our relationships with users or clients, adversely affecting our brand and our business. 
 In addition to the services we provide from our offices, we serve our clients primarily from third-party data-hosting facilities. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct. 
 Their systems and servers could also be subject to hacking, spamming, ransomware, computer viruses or other malicious software, denial of service attacks, service disruptions, including the inability to process certain transactions, phishing attacks, and unauthorized access attempts, including third parties gaining access to users accounts using stolen or inferred credentials or other means, and may use such access to prevent use of users accounts. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at two or more of the facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our Solution could be interrupted. 
 Our ability to deliver our Internet- and telecommunications-based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable mobile device, telephone, facsimile, and pager systems, all at a predictable and reasonable cost. We have experienced and expect that we will experience interruptions and delays in services and availability of our Solution from time to time. 
 We rely on internal systems as well as third-party vendors, including data center, bandwidth, and telecommunications equipment or service providers, to provide our Solution. We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for portions of our Solution. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users or clients. To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against: 
 damage from fire, power loss, and other natural disasters; 
 communications failures; 
 software and hardware errors, failures, and crashes; 
 security breaches, computer viruses, ransomware, and similar disruptive problems; and 
 other potential interruptions. 
 Any disruption in the network access, telecommunications, or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of or by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle the current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our ability to deliver our Solution and our business. We exercise limited control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. 
 
 90 

Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and clients, adversely affect our brands and business, and expose us to third-party liabilities. The insurance coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost. 
 The reliability and performance of the Internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the availability of the Internet to us for delivery of our Internet-based services. 
 We typically provide service level commitments under our client contracts. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Finally, recent changes in law could impact the cost and availability of necessary Internet infrastructure. Increased costs and/or decreased availability would negatively affect our results of operations. 
 Our business could be adversely impacted by changes in laws and regulations related to the Internet or changes in access to the Internet generally. 
 
 The future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for communication, business applications, and commerce. Federal or state government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. Legislators, regulators, or government bodies or agencies may also make legal or regulatory changes or interpret or apply existing laws or regulations that relate to the use of the Internet in new and materially different ways. Changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations could require us to modify our Solution in order to comply with these changes, to incur substantial additional costs or divert resources that could otherwise be deployed to grow our business, or expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, among other things. 
 
 In addition, government agencies and private organizations have imposed, and may in the future impose, additional taxes, fees, or other charges for accessing the Internet or commerce conducted via the Internet. Internet access is frequently provided by companies that have significant market power and could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of our clients use of our Solution, which could negatively impact our business. Net neutrality rules, which were designed to ensure that all online content is treated the same by Internet service providers and other companies that provide broadband services were repealed by the Federal Communications Commission effective June 2018. The repeal of the net neutrality rules could force us to incur greater operating expenses or our clients use of our Solution could be adversely affected, either of which could harm our business and results of operations. These developments could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications generally or result in reductions in the demand for Internet-based platforms and services such as ours, increased costs to us or the disruption of our business. In addition, as the Internet continues to experience growth in the numbers of users, frequency of use, and amount of data transmitted, the use of the Internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease-of-use, accessibility, and quality of service. The performance of the Internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been adversely affected by viruses, worms, and similar malicious programs and the Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. If the use of the Internet generally, or our Solution specifically, is adversely affected by these or other issues, we could be forced to incur substantial costs, demand for our Solution could decline, and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.

Our Solution utilizes open-source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open-source licenses could adversely affect our business. 
 We use software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under open-source licenses in our Solution. Some open-source licenses contain affirmative obligations or restrictive terms that could adversely impact our business, such as restrictions on commercialization or obligations to make available modified or derivative works of certain open-source code. If we were to combine our proprietary software with certain open-source software subject to these licenses in a certain manner, we could, under certain open-source licenses, be required to release or otherwise make available the source code to our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us. 
 Although we employ practices designed to manage our compliance with open-source licenses and protect our proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use open-source software in a manner we do not intend and that could expose us to claims for breach of contract and intellectual property infringement. If we are held to have breached the terms of an open-source software license, we could be required to, among other things, seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible, pay damages to third parties, to re-engineer our products, to discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, a portion of our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The terms of many open-source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and, as a result, there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our Solution. 
 We employ third-party licensed software and software components for use in or with our Solution, and the inability to maintain these licenses or the presence of errors in the software we license could limit the functionality of our Solution and result in increased costs or reduced service levels, which would adversely affect our business. 
 Our software applications might incorporate or interact with certain third-party software and software components (other than open-source software), such as data visualization software, obtained under licenses from other companies. We pay these third parties a license fee or royalty payment. We anticipate that we will continue to use such third-party software in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently make available, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to replace. Furthermore, these third parties may increase the price for licensing their software, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software could require clients to enter into license agreements with third parties. In addition, if the third-party software we make available has errors or otherwise malfunctions, or if the third-party terminates its agreement with us, the functionality of our Solution may be negatively impacted and our business may suffer. 
 Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. 
 Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2023, we had filed applications for a number of patents, and we have fourteen issued U.S. patents, four issued Canadian patents, one issued Great Britain patent, and one issued European patent, as well as one utility patent application pending in the United States. We also had twenty-eight registered trademarks in the United States, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, and China. We also rely on copyright and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, clients, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. For example, other parties, including our competitors, may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our services, or design around our intellectual property and, in such cases, we may not be able to assert our intellectual property rights against such parties. 
 
 92 

Further, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information, and we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. We make business decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where we seek patent protection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every significant feature of our Solution, technology, or proprietary information, or provide us with any competitive advantages. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will issue or be approved. The United States Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies also require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process and after a patent has issued. 
 There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent, or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we conduct business. Further, intellectual property law, including statutory and case law, particularly in the United States, is constantly developing, and any changes in the law could make it harder for us to enforce our rights. 
 In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. 
 An adverse determination of any litigation proceedings could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related pending patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during the course of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Negative publicity related to a decision by us to initiate such enforcement actions against a client or former client, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely impact our other client relationships or prospective client relationships, harm our brand and business, and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand and our business. 
 We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights or misappropriation of intellectual property. 
 There is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our future success depends in part on not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, including so-called non-practicing entities (NPEs), may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our Solution. From time to time, third parties have claimed or may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights or that we have misappropriated their intellectual property. 
 For example, in some cases, very broad patents are granted that may be interpreted as covering a wide field of healthcare data storage and analytics solutions or machine learning and predictive modeling methods in healthcare. As competition in our market grows, the possibility of patent infringement, trademark infringement, and other intellectual property claims against us increases. In the future, we expect others to claim that our Solution and underlying technology infringe or violate their intellectual property rights. In a patent infringement claim against us, we may assert, as a defense, that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims, that the patent is invalid or both. 
 
 93 

The strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted, the interpretation of these patents, and our ability to invalidate the asserted patents. However, we could be unsuccessful in advancing non-infringement and/or invalidity arguments in our defense. In the United States, issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity, and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. Conversely, the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence, which is a lower burden of proof. 
 We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services. Because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more aspects of our technology and services. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, whether or not successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages, ongoing royalty or license payments, or settlement fees, prevent us from offering our Solution or using certain technologies, require us to re-engineer all or a portion of our DOS platform, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our clients or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications, or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.

Risks Related to Governmental Regulation 
 Risks Related to Healthcare and Data Privacy and Security Regulation 
 Actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Health information privacy and security laws . There are numerous federal and state laws and regulations that govern the privacy and security of health information. In particular, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations implemented thereunder (collectively, HIPAA) imposes, among other things, certain standards relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of PHI, as defined under HIPAA. By processing and maintaining PHI on behalf of our covered entity clients, we are a HIPAA business associate and are required to enter into business associate agreements (BAAs) with our covered entity clients to safeguard PHI, as well as BAAs with our subcontractors that access or otherwise process PHI on our behalf. 
 We may not be able to adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA implementation. Furthermore, we are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance. We are unable to predict what, if any, impact the changes in such standards will have on our compliance costs or our Solution. Penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA vary significantly depending on the nature of violation and could include civil monetary or criminal penalties. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit under HIPAA on behalf of state residents. Courts can award damages, costs and attorneys fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. 
 While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for HIPAA violations, its standards have been used as the basis for a duty of care claim in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. Certain states have also adopted privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future clients and strategic partners. 
 Some of our analytics applications, including, for example, one of our benchmarking applications, require that we obtain permissions consistent with HIPAA to provide data aggregation services and the right to create de-identified information and to use and disclose such de-identified information. We may require large sets of de-identified information to enable us to continue to develop machine learning algorithms that enhance our Solution. If we are unable to secure these rights in client BAAs or as a result of any future changes to HIPAA or other applicable laws, we may face limitations on the use of PHI and our ability to use de-identified information that could negatively affect the scope of our Solution as well as impair our ability to provide upgrades and enhancements to our Solution. 
 We outsource important aspects of the storage and transmission of client information and PHI, and thus rely on third parties to manage functions that have material cybersecurity risks. We attempt to address these risks by requiring outsourcing subcontractors who handle client information to sign BAAs contractually requiring those subcontractors to adequately safeguard PHI in a similar manner that applies to us and in some cases by requiring such outsourcing subcontractors to undergo third party security examinations as well as to protect the confidentiality of other sensitive client information. In addition, we periodically hire third party security experts to assess and test our security measures. However, we cannot be assured that these contractual measures and other safeguards will adequately protect us from the risks associated with the storage and transmission of our clients' confidential and proprietary information and PHI. 

95 

Consumer protection laws. Furthermore, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also has authority to initiate enforcement actions against entities that mislead customers about HIPAA compliance, make deceptive statements about privacy and data sharing in privacy policies, fail to limit third-party use of personal health information, fail to implement policies to protect personal health information or engage in other unfair practices that harm customers or that may violate Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. According to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers personal information secure can also constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Additionally, federal and state consumer protection laws are increasingly being applied by FTC and states' attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal or personally identifiable information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content. 
 State data protection laws . Certain states have also adopted privacy and security laws and regulations, which govern the privacy, processing, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future clients and strategic partners. For example, California adopted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. 
 The CCPA established a privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the state of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Additionally, the CPRA generally went into effect on January 1, 2023 and significantly amends the CCPA. It imposed additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also created a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. Additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Similar laws have passed in other states, and are continuing to be proposed at the state and federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. If we fail to comply with any of these privacy laws that apply to us, and are subject to the aforementioned penalties, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. 
 GDPR and foreign data privacy protection laws . In addition, many foreign governments have established or are in the process of establishing privacy and data security legal frameworks governing the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from their residents. For example, in Europe, the GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR imposes data protection requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area (EEA) relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the documentation we must retain, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to 20 million or 4 of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place mechanisms to ensure compliance with GDPR. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having adequate data protection laws and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EEA and the United States remain uncertain. Case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) states that reliance on the standard contractual clauses - a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism - alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that transfers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 96 

On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Intelligence Activities which introduced new redress mechanisms and binding safeguards to address the concerns raised by the CJEU in relation to data transfers from the EEA to the United States and which formed the basis of the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), as released on December 13, 2022. The European Commission adopted its Adequacy Decision in relation to the DPF on July 10, 2023, rendering the DPF effective as a GDPR transfer mechanism to U.S. entities self-certified under the DPF. The DPF also introduced a new redress mechanism for EU citizens which addresses a key concern in the previous CJEU judgments and may mean transfers under standard contractual clauses are less likely to be challenged in future. We currently maintain localized infrastructure and third-party relationships to limit the risk of data transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and the UK. In addition, we rely on the EU standard contractual clauses and the UK Addendum to the EU standard contractual clauses as relevant to address any potential transfer of personal data outside the EEA and the UK, including to the United States, with respect to both intragroup and third-party transfers. We expect the existing legal complexity and uncertainty regarding international personal data transfers to continue. In particular, we expect the DPF Adequacy Decision to be challenged and international transfers to the United States and to other jurisdictions more generally to continue to be subject to enhanced scrutiny by regulators. As a result, we may have to make certain operational changes and we will have to implement revised standard contractual clauses. Data protection authorities of the different EEA member states may also interpret GDPR differently, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EEA. Any failure by us to comply with GDPR could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, and increase our costs and severely disrupt our business. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g., fines up to the greater of 20 million 17.5 million) or 4 of global turnover. On October 12, 2023, the UK Extension to the DPF came into effect (as approved by the UK Government), as a UK GDPR data transfer mechanism to U.S. entities self-certified under the UK Extension to the DPF. As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business. 
 
 Canadian data privacy protection laws . Similarly, Canada s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act provides Canadian residents with privacy protections in regard to transactions with businesses and organizations in the private sector and sets out ground rules for how private-sector organizations may collect, use, and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities. Foreign governments may attempt to apply such laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities. Other jurisdictions besides the EU and Canada are similarly introducing or enhancing laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security, which enhances risks relating to compliance with such laws. Furthermore, as we enter into business arrangements in countries outside of the United States, we will need to be prepared to comply with applicable local privacy laws. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal data, such as health-related data or other sensitive information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions that we operate. 
 We cannot be certain that the privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity relating to the privacy and security of personal information. There is ongoing concern from privacy advocates, regulators, and others regarding data protection and privacy issues, and the number of jurisdictions with data protection and privacy laws has been increasing. Also, there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for de-identified, anonymous, or pseudonymized health information are sufficient, and the risk of re-identification sufficiently small, to adequately protect patient privacy. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security in the United States, including the CCPA and CPRA, and we cannot yet determine the impact such laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business. 
 
 97 

Future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations could impair our or our clients ability to collect, use, or disclose information relating to consumers, which could decrease demand for our Solution, increase our costs, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our client base and increase our revenue. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with international, federal or state laws or regulations, industry standards, or other legal obligations, or any actual or suspected security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release, or transfer of personally identifiable information or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines, and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our clients to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. 
 We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and our ability to develop new products and features could be limited. Any of these developments could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Privacy and data security concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our Solution. 
 Government regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies. 
 Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear. In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the data analytics and improvement services that we provide, and these laws and regulations may be applied to our Solution in ways that we do not anticipate, particularly as we develop and release new and more sophisticated solutions. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply with them, could create significant liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business. Some of the risks we face or may face from healthcare regulation are described below. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by these programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Some enforcement activities focus on below or above market payments for federally reimbursable healthcare items or services as evidence of the intent to provide a kickback. Many states also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program. Moreover, both federal and state laws prohibit bribery and similar behavior. We do not believe we directly order or provide healthcare services that are reimbursable by Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors or submit claims or receive reimbursement from any such payor. However, nonetheless, in addition to direct enforcement action against us, if our advisory services or our Solution offered to clients are associated with action by clients that is determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations, it is possible that an enforcement agency would also try to hold us liable and, as a result of such attempt to hold us liable, our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted, even if we are ultimately found not liable. 
 There are also numerous federal and state laws that prohibit the submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with submission and payment of claims for healthcare items and services by healthcare providers. For example, the federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. The government has prosecuted revenue cycle management service providers for causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims in violation of the False Claims Act. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 

98 

HIPAA also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Any determination by a court or regulatory agency that we or any of our clients, vendors, or partners have violated these laws could subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, subject us to additional reporting requirements and oversight under a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payors, and have an adverse effect on our business. Our clients failure to comply with these laws and regulations in connection with our services could result in substantial liability (including, but not limited to, criminal liability), adversely affect demand for our Solution, and force us to expend significant capital, research and development, and other resources to address the failure. Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity, distract management attention from our business, require a costly response from us, and negatively impact the price of our common stock. 
 If our arrangements with clinicians and other healthcare professionals are found to constitute the improper rendering of professional medical services or fee splitting under applicable state laws, our business, financial condition, and our ability to operate in those states could be adversely impacted. 
 We employ and contract with physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals who assist our clients with the clients care coordination, care management, population health management, and patient safety activities. Although we do not intend to provide medical care, treatment, or advice, our relationships with such healthcare professionals may implicate certain state laws in the United States in which we operate that generally prohibit non-professional entities from providing licensed medical services, exercising control over licensed physicians or other licensed healthcare professionals, or engaging in certain practices such as fee-splitting with such licensed professionals. There can be no assurance that these laws will be interpreted in a manner consistent with our practices or that other laws or regulations will not be enacted in the future that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Regulatory authorities, state boards of medicine, state attorneys general, and other parties may assert that we are engaged in the provision of professional medical services, and/or that our arrangements with our affiliated physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals constitute unlawful fee-splitting. If a jurisdiction s prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine or fee-splitting is interpreted in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices, we may be required to restructure or terminate some portions of our business, which may in turn require us to refund portions of our services fees, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity, distraction of management attention from our business, a costly response from us, and a substantial negative impact upon the price of our common stock. 
 The FDA may modify its enforcement policies with respect to medical software products, and our software products may become subject to extensive regulatory requirements, which may increase the cost of conducting, or otherwise harm, our business. 
 We develop and offer certain analytical software applications in connection with our business. The FDA may regulate medical or health-related software, including machine learning functionality and predictive algorithms, if such software falls within the definition of a medical device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and by other federal, state, and local authorities. 
 
 99 

The FDCA and related regulations govern the conditions of safety, efficacy, clearance, approval, manufacturing, quality system requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of medical devices. However, historically, the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion for certain low-risk software functions, and has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to the regulation of software as a medical device. In addition, the 21st Century Cures Act amended the FDCA to exclude from the definition of medical device certain medical-related software, including software used for administrative support functions at a healthcare facility, software intended for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle, software designed to store electronic health records, software for transferring, storing, or displaying medical device data or in vitro diagnostic data, and certain clinical decision support software. We believe our currently marketed products provide functionality that is exempt from the FDCA s definition of a medical device, and therefore that our software products are not currently regulated by the FDA as medical devices, or that our products are otherwise subject to FDA s current enforcement discretion policies applicable to software products. However, there is a risk that the FDA could disagree with our determination, or that the FDA could alter its enforcement discretion policies, and in either case, subject our software to more stringent medical device regulations. 
 If the FDA determines that any of our current or future analytics applications are regulated as medical devices and not otherwise subject to enforcement discretion, we would become subject to various requirements under the FDCA and the FDA s implementing regulations. If this occurs, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall our product until we obtain the requisite clearances or approvals, which would entail significant cost and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, or comparable state or foreign regulatory authorities, including: untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties, recalls, termination of distribution, administrative detentions, seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, delays in or refusal to grant clearances or approvals, prohibitions on sales of our products, and criminal prosecution. Any of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The healthcare regulatory and political framework is uncertain and evolving. 
 Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry, or changes to existing laws and regulations could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs, and/or restrict our operations. Reforming the healthcare industry has been a priority for U.S. politicians, and key members of the legislative and executive branches have proposed a wide variety of potential changes and policy goals. Certain changes to laws impacting our industry, or perceived intentions to do so, could affect our business and results of operations. By way of example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and has significantly impacted our industry and, to some degree, our business. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. We anticipate that new cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms will continue to be implemented at both the federal and state level, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

100 

Due to the particular nature of certain services we provide or the manner in which we provide them, we may be subject to additional government regulation and foreign government regulation. 
 While our Solution is primarily subject to government regulations pertaining to healthcare, certain aspects of our Solution may require us to comply with regulatory schema from other areas. Examples of such regulatory schema include: 
 Antitrust laws . Our national cloud-based network allows us access to cost and pricing data for a large number of providers in most regional markets, as well as to the contracted rates for third-party payors. To the extent that our Solution enables providers to compare their cost and pricing data with those of their competitors, those providers could collude to increase the pricing for their services, to reduce the compensation they pay their employees, or to collectively negotiate agreements with third parties. Similarly, if payors are able to compare their contracted rates of payment to providers, those payors may seek to reduce the amounts they might otherwise pay. Such actions may be deemed to be anti-competitive and a violation of federal antitrust laws. To the extent that we are deemed to have enabled such activities, we could be subject to fines and penalties imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice or the FTC and be required to curtail or terminate the services that permitted such collusion. 
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and foreign anti-bribery laws . The FCPA makes it illegal for U.S. persons, including U.S. companies, and their subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, and agents, to promise, authorize or make any corrupt payment, or otherwise provide anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, any foreign political party or party official, or candidate for foreign political office to obtain or retain business. Violations of the FCPA can also result in violations of other U.S. laws, including anti-money laundering, mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy laws. There are severe penalties for violating the FCPA. In addition, the Company may also be subject to other non-U.S. anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. If our employees, contractors, vendors, or partners fail to comply with the FCPA and/or foreign anti-bribery laws, we may be subject to penalties or sanctions, and our ability to develop new prospects and retain existing clients could be adversely affected. 
 Economic sanctions and export controls . Economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, and dealings with specified countries and territories, their governments, and in certain circumstances, with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries, and other sanctioned persons, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. As federal, state and foreign legislative regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions in these areas increase, we expect our costs to comply with these requirements will increase as well. Failure to comply with any of these requirements could result in the limitation, suspension or termination of our services, imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, and/or the seizure and/or forfeiture of our assets. Further, our Solution incorporates encryption technology. This encryption technology may be exported from the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by a license, a license exception, or other appropriate government authorizations. Such solutions may also be subject to certain regulatory reporting requirements. Various countries also regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our clients ability to import our Solution into those countries. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and of exports and imports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required approval for our Solution, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the provision of our Solution, including with respect to new applications, may delay the introduction of our Solution in various markets or, in some cases, prevent the provision of our Solution to some countries altogether. 
 Regulatory certification . We must obtain certification from governmental agencies, such as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to sell certain of our analytics applications and services in the United States. We cannot be certain that our Solution will continue to meet these standards. The failure to comply with these certification requirements could result in the loss of certification, which could restrict our Solution offerings and cause us to lose clients.

Risks Related to Tax Regulation 
 Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value-added or similar transactional taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We do not collect sales and use, value-added, and similar transactional taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable or that we are not required to collect such taxes with respect to the jurisdiction. Sales and use, value-added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties, interest or future requirements, increase in tax rates, or a combination of the foregoing may result in an increase in our sales and similar transactional taxes, increase administrative burdens or costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities, including as a result of our international operations or implementation of new tax rules, could harm our future results. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and are expanding into various foreign jurisdictions that are subject to income tax. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions and complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of factors outside of our control or relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. In addition, changes in tax and trade laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. 
 Forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, changes in available tax attributes, decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes, and changes in federal, state, or international tax laws and accounting principles. Finally, we may be subject to income tax audits throughout the world. An adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition for that period. 
 Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately 602.6 million and 505.5 million, respectively, which may be available to offset taxable income in the future, and which expire in various years beginning in 2032 for federal purposes if not utilized. The state NOLs will expire depending upon the various rules in the states in which we operate. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs before they expire. In general, under Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an ownership change (as defined under Section 382 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset its future taxable income. 
 We may experience a future ownership change under Section 382 of the Code that could affect our ability to utilize the NOLs to offset our income. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to reduce future income tax liabilities, including for state income tax purposes. 
 
 102 

Certain provisions of the Tax Act (as defined below), as amended by the CARES Act, also limit the use of NOLs, as discussed further below. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs, even if we attain profitability, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Comprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) was signed into law. The Tax Act contains, among other things, significant changes to corporate taxation, including (i) a reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat rate of 21 , (ii) a limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30 of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses) (increased to 50 by the CARES Act for taxable years beginning in 2019 and 2020), (iii) a limitation of the deduction for NOLs in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 to 80 of current year taxable income in respect of NOLs generated during or after 2018 and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks for NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2020, (iv) a one-time tax on offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, (v) immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and (vi) a modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. For federal NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act (as modified by the CARES Act) limits a taxpayer s ability to utilize federal NOL carryforwards in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 to 80 of taxable income. In addition, federal NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but carryback of federal NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2020 is generally prohibited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. 
 Beginning in 2022, the Tax Act eliminated the option to currently deduct research and development expenditures in the period incurred and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize such domestic and foreign expenditures over five or fifteen years, respectively, pursuant to Section 174 of the Code. We will continue to examine the impact the Tax Act and CARES Act may have on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
 
 Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our existing or future debt obligations, and we may not generate sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt. 
 
 On April 14, 2020, we issued our Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 230.0 million, which will mature on April 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The Notes are governed by an indenture (Indenture) between us, as the issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes are our senior, unsecured obligations and accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2020, at a rate of 2.50 per year. The Indenture does not contain any financial covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. We may repurchase the Notes from time to time prior to the maturity date. A holder may convert all or any portion of its Notes, at its option, subject to certain conditions and during certain periods, into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, with the form of consideration determined at our election. Noteholders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at 100 of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date, upon the occurrence of certain events. The conversion rate is initially 32.6797 shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 30.60 per share of our common stock). If the Notes have not previously been converted, redeemed or repurchased, we will be required to repay the Notes in cash at maturity. 
 
 In addition, on July 16, 2024, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides for a five-year term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of up to 225 million, consisting of an initial term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 125 million, which was funded in full at closing, and a delayed draw term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 100 million, which was undrawn as of the closing. 
 
 Our outstanding and any future debt obligations could make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic conditions, including rising interest rates, regulatory, and competitive conditions. We may not use the cash proceeds from the Notes and/or the Term Loan Facility in an optimally productive and profitable manner. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on market conditions and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors, including those described in these risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
 
 103 

In the case of the Notes, that includes our ability to make required cash payments in connection with redemptions or conversions of the Notes, repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events, or to repay or refinance the Notes at maturity. For example, we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all in the event of a failure of these financial institutions. In addition, our ability satisfy our debt obligations may be limited by law or regulatory authority or by other agreements governing our future indebtedness. 
 
 Since inception, our business has generated net losses, and we may continue to incur significant losses. As a result, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make payments owed under the Notes and/or the Term Loan Facility. If we are unable to satisfy our debt obligations, we may be required to seek funds from external sources, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and which could intensify the risks related to our indebtedness and further restrict our operating and financial flexibility. Further, any repayment of our debt with equity would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. In the event of a default on our debt obligations, we may be required to repurchase the Notes, amounts owed under our Term Loan Facility may be accelerated, and assets serving as collateral under our Term Loan Credit Facility may be subject to foreclosure. Any default under the Indenture or the Credit Agreement could also lead to a default under our future indebtedness and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, if we are liquidated, the lender s rights to repayment would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock to receive any proceeds from the liquidation. 
 
 Our Credit Agreement contains covenants and other provisions that restrict our ability to take certain actions and may limit our ability to operate or grow our business in the future. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, engaging in mergers and other fundamental changes, the making of investments, entering into transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends and other restricted payments, the prepayment of other indebtedness and the sale of assets. The Credit Agreement also requires us to comply with a minimum liquidity threshold, a maximum recurring revenue-based ratio and a maximum EBITDA-based net leverage ratio. In addition, payments of amounts owed under the Term Loan Facility will require us to dedicate cash flow from operations or cash on hand, which will reduce the amounts available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, transactions (including pursuing strategic initiatives), and other general corporate purposes. Such limitations could limit our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business or industry; place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; limit our ability to borrow or otherwise raise additional capital as needed; or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate risks with regard to our Term Loan Facility and any future refinancing thereof. 
 
 Outstanding principal amounts under our Term Loan Facility are expected to accrue interest at a floating rate equal to SOFR plus 6.5 per year. In the event that SOFR is unavailable, interest will accrue at a floating rate equal to the alternate base rate plus 5.5 per year. Accordingly, whenever we have amounts outstanding under our Term Loan Facility, our cash flows and results of operations will be subject to interest rate risk exposure associated with the debt balance outstanding. We currently are not a party to an interest rate swap contract or other derivative instrument designed to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuation risk. 
 
 Our Capped Calls may affect the value of our common stock and subject us to counterparty risk. 
 
 On April 8, 2020, concurrently with the pricing of our Notes, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers exempt from registration under the Securities Act (Note Offering), we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (Base Capped Calls) with certain financial institutions (the option counterparties). In addition, in connection with the initial purchasers exercise in full of their option to purchase additional Notes, on April 9, 2020, we entered into additional capped call transactions (Additional Capped Calls, and, together with the Base Capped Calls, the Capped Calls) with each of the option counterparties. We used approximately 21.6 million of the net proceeds from the Note Offering to pay the cost of the Capped Calls and allocated issuance costs. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of 42.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments. 
 
 104 

The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to the cap price. The Capped Calls are separate transactions that we entered into with the option counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Notes. The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of such option counterparties may default under the Capped Calls. 
 
 From time to time, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or our other securities in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. In addition, our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the Capped Calls. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by any option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any option counterparty. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 Risks Related to an Investment in Our Securities 
 We have a limited operating history in an evolving industry which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business future prospects and increases the risk of your investment. 
 We launched operations in 2008 and we acquired Able Health, Healthfinch, Vitalware, Twistle, ARMUS, KPI Ninja, ERS, Carevive and Lumeon between February 2020 and August 2024. Our limited operating history, in particular with respect to the businesses we have recently acquired, makes it difficult to effectively assess or forecast our future prospects. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter or may encounter. 
 These risks and difficulties include our ability to cost-effectively acquire new clients and retain existing clients, maintain the quality of our technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle the requirements of our clients and deploy new features and solutions, and successfully compete with other companies that are currently in, or may enter, the healthcare solution space. Additional risks include our ability to effectively manage growth, achieve synergies, responsibly use the data that clients share with us, process, store, protect, and use personal data, including PHI, in compliance with governmental regulation, contractual obligations, and other legal obligations related to privacy and security and avoid interruptions or disruptions in our service or slower than expected load times for our Solution. If we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above, our business and our results of operations will be adversely affected. 
 We have experienced significant net losses since inception, we expect to incur losses in the future, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability. 
 We have incurred significant net losses in the past, including net losses of 118.1 million and 137.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of 1,117.2 million as of December 31, 2023. We expect our costs will increase over time as we continue to invest to grow our business and build relationships with clients, develop our Solution, develop new solutions, and operate as a public company. These efforts may prove to be more expensive than we currently anticipate and external factors, such as macroeconomic challenges, including the high inflationary environment and rising interest rates, could cause an increase in our expenses, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. 
 
 105 

As a result, we may need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financings in order to fund our operations. To date, we have financed our operations principally from the proceeds we received through private sales of equity securities, payments received from sales of our Solution, borrowings under our loan and security agreements, our IPO in July 2019, the Note Offering in April 2020, and an underwritten public offering of 4,882,075 shares (inclusive of the underwriters over-allotment option to purchase 636,792 shares) of our common stock at 53.00 per share in August 2021, from which we received net proceeds of 245.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs (the Secondary Public Equity Offering). We may also fail to improve the gross margins of our business. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks and difficulties as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our common stock. 
 The market price of our common stock may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may lose all or part of your investments. 
 
 The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 
 overall performance of the equity markets and/or publicly-listed technology companies; 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our net revenue or other operating metrics; 
 changes in the financial projections we provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections; 
 failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet the estimates or the expectations of investors; 
 the economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry; 
 rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; 
 announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; 
 new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; 
 lawsuits or investigations threatened or filed against us; 
 recruitment or departure of key personnel; and 
 other events or factors, including those resulting from macroeconomic challenges (including high inflationary and/or high interest rate environments), war, bank or financial institution failures, incidents of terrorism, public health crises, or responses to these events. 
 In addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies stock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and harm our business. Moreover, because of these fluctuations, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our net revenue or results of operations fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated net revenue or earnings forecasts that we may provide. 
 
 106 

If securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our common stock and trading volume could decline. 
 The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock could be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us on a regular basis, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline. 
 We cannot guarantee that the Share Repurchase Plan will be fully consummated or will enhance stockholder value, and share repurchases could affect the price of our common stock. 
 On August 2, 2022, our board of directors authorized and approved the Share Repurchase Plan, pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 40.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock. We began repurchasing shares of common stock under this program during the third quarter of 2022 and had 29.8 million available to purchase under the Share Repurchase Plan as of September 30, 2024. Repurchases of shares of common stock under the Share Repurchase Plan may be made from time to time, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases to be determined at the discretion of our management, depending on market conditions and corporate needs. 
 Open market repurchases will be structured to occur in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including within the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our shares of common stock under this authorization. The timing, pricing, and sizes of these repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock and general market and economic conditions. The Share Repurchase Plan could affect the price of our common stock, increase volatility, and diminish our cash reserves. 
 Our management has broad discretion in the use of proceeds from our IPO, the Note Offering, and the Secondary Public Equity Offering and our use may not produce a positive rate of return. 
 The principal purposes of our IPO were to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility, create a public market for our stock and thereby enable access to the public equity markets by our employees and stockholders, obtain additional capital, and strengthen our position in the healthcare data analytics applications and services market. We used a portion of the Note Offering proceeds to pay the cost of the Capped Call transactions and to prepay in full all outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreement with OrbiMed. We cannot specify with certainty our plans for the use of the net proceeds we received from these offerings. However, we intend to use the net proceeds we received from our IPO, the Note Offering, and our Secondary Public Equity Offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from these offerings for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business. 
 Our management has broad discretion over the specific use of the net proceeds we received in these offerings and might not be able to obtain a significant return, if any, on investment of these net proceeds. Investors will need to rely upon the judgment of our management with respect to the use of proceeds. If we do not use the net proceeds that we received in our IPO, the Note Offering, and our Secondary Public Equity Offering effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed. 
 Our issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders. 
 We expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors, and consultants under our stock incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future, including through offerings similar to our Secondary Public Equity Offering during the third quarter of 2021. 
 
 107 

As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment, such as our issuance of equity securities in connection with our acquisitions. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per-share value of our common stock to decline. 
 The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members. 
 As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing standards of Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations. As a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Although we have already hired additional employees to assist us in complying with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from business operations to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. 
 We also expect that being a public company and these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers. 
 As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition is more visible, which may result in an increased risk of threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 The individuals who now constitute our senior management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company and limited experience complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our senior management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to a public company that is subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations. 

108 

We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the ability of common stockholders to achieve a return on investment will depend on appreciation, if any, in the price of our common stock. 
 You should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future credit facility or financing we obtain may contain, terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. As a result, common stockholders may only receive a ROI if the market price of our common stock increases. 
 We could be subject to securities class action litigation. 
 In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because technology and healthcare technology companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could harm our business. 
 Risks Related to Our Charter and Bylaws 
 Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors, and limit the market price of our common stock. 
 Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, include provisions that: 
 provide that our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms; 
 permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships; 
 require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws; 
 authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan; 
 provide that only a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; 
 prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; 
 provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws; and 
 advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. 
 Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock. 
 
 109 

Our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. 
 Our amended and restated bylaws include an exclusive forum provision that provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: 
 any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; 
 any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees; 
 any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; or 
 any action that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine and asserts a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees or stockholders. 
 This exclusive forum provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act. Further, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such Securities Act claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause or causes of action arising under the Securities Act; however, a court may not enforce such provision. 
 This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision which will be contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

General Risks 
 Changes in accounting principles may cause previously unanticipated fluctuations in our financial results, and the implementation of such changes may impact our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations. 
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP which are subject to interpretation or changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and other various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. New accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting principles have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future which may have a significant effect on our financial results. Furthermore, any difficulties in implementation of changes in accounting principles, including the ability to modify our accounting systems, could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors confidence in us. 
 Economic uncertainties or downturns in the general economy or the industries in which our clients operate could disproportionately affect the demand for our Solution and negatively impact our results of operations. 
 General worldwide economic conditions have experienced significant downturns during the last ten or more years, and market volatility and uncertainty remain widespread, making it potentially very difficult for our clients and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. During challenging economic times, our clients may have difficulty gaining timely access to sufficient credit or obtaining credit on reasonable terms, increased costs, and/or other negative financial impacts, each of which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us, reduce client expansion and new client acquisition, increase client churn, and adversely affect our revenue. If that were to occur, our financial results could be harmed. Further, challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our clients to pay for the applications and services they already have purchased from us and, as a result, our write-offs of accounts receivable could increase. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery. If the condition of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsens, our business could be harmed. 
 Investors expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social, and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. 
 There is an increasing focus from certain investors, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social, and governance factors. For example, increasingly there are disclosure regulations focused on environmental, social and sustainability matters. The SEC recently adopted final climate change disclosure regulation that, if it survives the litigation it is currently subject to, will require us to make certain disclosures that may be costly for our company. We are currently evaluating this regulation to determine its impact on us. 
 
 In addition, some investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. Third-party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased to meet growing investor demand for measurement of corporate responsibility performance. The criteria by which companies corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. If we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. 
 Furthermore, if our competitors corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental, social and governance matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, employees, and other stakeholders, or, if our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation and business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely impacted.
