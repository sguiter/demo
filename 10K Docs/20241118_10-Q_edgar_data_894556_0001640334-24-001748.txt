Our principal executive offices are located at 1740H Del Range Blvd, Suite 166, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82009. We are an environmentally sustainable flame retardant and flame suppression company for the residential home industry throughout the United States. On January 3, 2022, the Company formed Mighty Fire Breaker, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company MFB Ohio ), to acquire all the intellectual property of Mighty Fire Breaker, LLC, a California limited liability company MFB California in connection with the flame retardant and flame suppression segments of the environmental industry, including patents and patents pending. On April 13, 2022, the transaction between the Company, MFB Ohio and MFB California closed. The transaction consideration to the equity holders of MFB California was 1,000,000 shares of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company with a value at closing of 4,200,000, and a 10 royalty on gross sales before taxes of the MFB Ohio family of products. 24 Table of Contents Steve Conboy, who founded MFB California, has been in the lumber business for over 30 years. Approximately 10 years ago, he realized that residential and commercial fires, as well as wildfires, would not cease for the foreseeable future. Mr. Conboy understood that, even if lumber was treated, it was toxic by nature and this toxicity is harmful to humans and the environment. He realized that there was a market, and most importantly a need, for a product that was capable of fire suppression and being a fire retardant while also being the safest for the environment and for human beings. Mr. Conboy set out to develop a formula for a product that would meet these requirements. During the course of research and development, Mr. Conboy formed MFB California and contributed numerous patents toward development of a green product line that was envisioned many years ago. That product is its CitroTech MFB 31 Technology . Since MFB Ohio acquired the MFB California portfolio of intellectual property, Company management has continued to develop many formulations to achieve the vision. In addition, the Company has been recognized and certified for their achievement. These recognitions and achievements, including twice receiving the EPA Safer Choice award and being the first and only EPA certified fire retardant, UL Certification, GreenGaurd Gold for no VOCs, other accreditations, and adoption by departments throughout the State of California. Our management is comprised of one individual, Joshua Ralston, who is our President, Chief Executive officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors..

Contractual Obligations Lease Agreements The Company has one lease classified as an operating lease for an office and warehouse purpose. The following table outlines maturities of our lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024: Year ending December 31, 2024 (excluding the nine months ended September 30, 2024) 21,798 2025 50,862 Thereafter - 72,660 Less: Imputed interest (1,737 Operating lease liabilities 70,923 Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared (i) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and (ii) assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated significant income to date. The Company is subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a business with no substantive revenue, as well as limitations on its operating capital resources. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. In light of these matters, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to raise capital and generate revenue and profits in the future. Future Capital Requirements Our current available cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Our capital requirements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, will depend on numerous factors, including management s evaluation of the timing of projects to pursue. Subject to our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from operations and our ability to raise additional capital (including through possible joint ventures or partnerships), we expect to incur substantial expenditures to carry out our business plan, as well as costs associated with our capital raising efforts and being a public company. Our plans to finance our operations include seeking equity and debt financing, alliances or other partnership agreements, or other business transactions that would generate sufficient resources to ensure the continuation of our operations. The sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in further dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could have rights senior to those of our Common Stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we were unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of, delay or eliminate some or all of our planned activities and limit our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations results. 31 Table of Contents Contingencies Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. In consultation with its legal counsel as appropriate, our management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, we, in consultation with legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in our financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is likely, but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: Revenue Recognition Incremental borrowing rate for Right of Use Assets Share based compensation Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally of product used for lumber product for fire prevention. Revenue is recognized at a point in time, that is which the risks and rewards of ownership of the product transfer from the Company to the customer. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less. Incremental borrowing rate for Right of Use Assets As the Company s operating leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate. The assessment of the Company s incremental borrowing rate involves judgment regarding the cost of borrowing funds on a collateralized basis over a similar term and in a similar economic environment. 32 Table of Contents Share-Based Compensation The Company accounts for employee and non-employee stock awards under ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, whereby equity instruments issued to employees for services are recorded based on the fair value of the instrument issued and those issued to nonemployees are recorded based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally the vesting period. If an award is granted, but vesting does not occur, any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed in the period related to the termination of service. Off-balance sheet arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms as a result of the following material weaknesses: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) management is dominated by one individual without adequate compensating controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We expect to be materially dependent upon a third party to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will not result in errors in our financial statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements. Changes in Internal Controls There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company s internal control over financial reporting. Management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional improvements as necessary. 33 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. Item 1A.
