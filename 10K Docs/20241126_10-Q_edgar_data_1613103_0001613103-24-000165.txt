 Senior Notes 
 The Company has outstanding unsecured senior obligations, described as senior notes in the tables above (collectively, the Senior Notes). The Senior Notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Company is in compliance with all covenants related to the Senior Notes. 
 On June 3, 2024, Medtronic Inc. issued tranches of EUR-denominated Senior Notes with an aggregate principal of billion, with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2030 to 2054, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. In anticipation of the Euro-denominated debt issuance, the Company entered into forward currency exchange rate contracts to manage the exposure to exchange rate movements. These contracts were settled in conjunction with the issuance of the June 2024 Notes.

 At October 25, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Company s Senior Notes was billion compared to a principal value of billion. At April 26, 2024, the estimated fair value was billion compared to a principal value of billion.

 significant. During the three and six months ended October 25, 2024, amounts related to excluded components that are amortized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument were significant. Cash flows related to the Company's derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows attributed to amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage its exposure to the variability of future cash flows that are denominated in a foreign currency. 
 At inception, foreign currency forward and option contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction affects earnings. When the hedged transaction affects earnings, the gain or loss on the derivative is reclassified to earnings. Amounts excluded from the measurement of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge. Cash flows are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 The Company's cash flow hedges will mature within the subsequent period. At October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024, the Company had million and million in after-tax unrealized gains, respectively, associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss . The Company expects that million of after-tax net unrealized gains at October 25, 2024 will be recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the next 12 months. 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 The Company uses derivative instruments and foreign currency denominated debt to manage foreign currency risk associated with its net investment in foreign operations. The derivative instruments that the Company uses for this purpose may include foreign currency forward exchange contracts used on a standalone basis or in combination with option collars and standalone cross currency interest rate contracts.

During the three and six months ended October 27, 2023, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, in after-tax unrealized gains representing excluded components in interest expense, net . The cash flows related to the Company's derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows attributable to amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 Undesignated Derivatives 
 The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the Company s exposure to the change in the value of non-functional currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. 
 These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are not designated as hedges at inception, and therefore, changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Cash flows related to the Company s undesignated derivative contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the derivative instrument.

 The Company's effective tax rate for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 was and , respectively, as compared to and for the three and six months ended October 27, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended October 25, 2024, primarily relates to the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net operating losses recorded during the three months ended October 27, 2023, which was partially offset by the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. In addition to the items discussed in the current quarter, the decrease in the effective tax rate for the six months ended October 25, 2024 was also attributable to an income tax reserve adjustment made during the six months ended October 27, 2023 associated with the Ventor court decision noted above. 
 At October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024, the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits were billion and billion, respectively. In addition, the Company had accrued gross interest and penalties of million at October 25, 2024. If all of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, approximately billion would impact the Company s effective tax rate. At October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024, the amount of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits, net of cash advance, recorded as a noncurrent liability within accrued income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets was billion and billion, respectively. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income and records the liability within either current or noncurrent accrued income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets.

certain litigation charges and million of certain litigation charges during the three and six months ended October 25, 2024, respectively, whereas the Company recognized million and million of certain litigation charges during the three and six months ended October 27, 2023, respectively. At October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024, accrued litigation was approximately billion. The ultimate cost to the Company with respect to accrued litigation could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. The Company includes accrued litigation in other accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the legal matters discussed below, the Company believes it is possible that the costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. 
 Intellectual Property Matters 
 At any given time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property (IP) rights, and licenses, acquisitions or other agreements relating to such rights. This litigation includes, but is not limited to, alleged infringement or misappropriation of IP rights, or breach of obligations related to IP rights, or other claims asserted by competitors, individuals, or, consistent with a growing trend across technology-intensive industries, other entities created specifically to fund IP litigation. While the outcome of these litigation matters is inherently uncertain, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require the Company to pay significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, and negatively impact the Company's ability to sell current or future products, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 Colibri 
 The Company is a defendant in patent litigation brought by Colibri Heart Valve LLC (Colibri) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Colibri alleges infringement of one patent by the Company s Evolut family of transcatheter aortic valve replacement devices. The patent asserted by Colibri has expired. On February 8, 2023, a jury returned a verdict against the Company for approximately million. In July 2023, the Company filed its appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Company has not recognized an expense in connection with this matter because it does not currently believe a loss is probable. 
 Product Liability Matters 
 Hernia Mesh Litigation 
 Starting in fiscal year 2020, plaintiffs began filing lawsuits against certain subsidiaries of the Company in U.S. state and federal courts that allege personal injury from hernia mesh products sold by those subsidiaries. As of October 30, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed on behalf of approximately individual plaintiffs, and certain plaintiffs law firms have advised the Company that they may file additional cases in the future. Approximately plaintiffs have pending lawsuits in a coordinated proceeding in Massachusetts state court, where they have been consolidated before a single judge. Approximately plaintiffs have pending lawsuits in a coordinated action in Minnesota state court, and there are approximately actions coordinated in a federal Multidistrict Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts plus fewer than one-off cases filed in other courts. The pending lawsuits relate almost entirely to hernia mesh products that have not been subject to recalls, withdrawals, or other adverse regulatory action. The Company has not recorded an expense related to damages in connection with these matters because any potential loss is not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters.

lawsuits filed on behalf of individuals. Plaintiffs firms previously notified the Company that they may file additional lawsuits in the future on behalf of thousands of additional claimants. Most of the filed suits are coordinated in California state court. The Company has not recorded an expense related to damages in connection with these matters because any potential loss is not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters. 
 Environmental Proceedings 
 The Company is a successor to several investigation and cleanup actions at various stages related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites, including in Orrington, Maine. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including removal of solvents, metals and other hazardous substances from soil and groundwater. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash flows is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. 
 The Company is also a successor to a party named in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine in the early 2000's by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Maine People's Alliance relating to mercury contamination of the Penobscot River and Bay and options for remediating such contamination. In October 2022, the court issued a final order approving the settlement and the parties are working with consultants on implementation of remedial activities. The final court order did not result in a change to the Company's previous accrual for this matter. 
 The Company's accrued expenses for these various environmental proceedings are included within accrued litigation as discussed above. 
 Anti-Corruption Matters 
 The Company has regular and ongoing interactions with governmental agencies, and its practice is to cooperate with such inquiries. In addition, from time to time, the Company self-discloses potential concerns to governmental regulators. Like many in the medical device industry or with international operations, the Company engages in periodic discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Department of Justice, and various authorities in China regarding certain activities, including in China. The Company is committed to regularly evaluating and, as appropriate, strengthening its anti-corruption compliance programs and practices. Any possible future determination that certain of our operations and activities, and/or those of our third-party distributors, are not in compliance with existing laws could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, and equitable remedies in the United States or in other jurisdictions. The Company has not recorded an expense in connection with these matters because any potential loss is not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters. 
 Other Matters 
 Italian Payback 
 In 2015, payback legislation was enacted in Italy requiring companies selling medical devices to make payments to the Italian state if Italy s medical device expenditures exceed annual regional maximum ceilings. The payment amounts are calculated based upon the amount by which the regional ceilings were exceeded for any given year. There has been significant scrutiny on the legality and enforceability of the payback law since its inception, and litigation challenging the law has been proceeding through the Italian Courts. Since the law was enacted, the Company has recognized an estimate for the amount of variable consideration but has not made any payments under the payback law. In July 2024, two rulings by the Constitutional Court of Italy found that the medical device payback law is constitutional. Therefore, the Company increased its liability pertaining primarily to certain prior years since 2015 by million during the three months ended July 26, 2024, as a reduction to net sales in the consolidated statements of income. As litigation before Italian Courts is still pending, final resolution is unknown at this time, and it is possible that the amount of the Company s liability could differ from the amount currently accrued. 
 Income Taxes 
 In March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of the Company's key manufacturing sites. The U.S. Tax Court (Tax Court) reviewed this dispute, and in June 2016, issued an opinion with respect to the allocation of income between the parties for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 whereby it generally rejected the IRS s position, but also made certain modifications to the Medtronic, Inc. tax returns as filed. In April 2017, the IRS filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Medtronic plc and its subsidiaries (Medtronic plc, Medtronic, or the Company, or we, us, or our). For a full understanding of financial condition and results of operations, you should read this discussion along with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024. In addition, you should read this discussion along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at and for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024. Amounts reported in millions within this quarterly report are computed based on the amounts in thousands, and therefore, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Additionally, certain columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding. 
 Financial Trends 
 Throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis, we present certain financial measures that facilitate management's review of the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning; however, such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) (U.S. GAAP). These financial measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" and are intended to supplement, and should not be considered as superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the Company's underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry. 
 As presented in the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations section on the following pages, our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets and certain charges or benefits that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods (Non-GAAP Adjustments). 
 In the event there is a Non-GAAP Adjustment recognized in our operating results, the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported. Because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the Non-GAAP Adjustments that take place during the period, we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the non-GAAP nominal tax rate (Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate). The Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate is calculated as the income tax provision, adjusted for the impact of Non-GAAP Adjustments, as a percentage of income before income taxes, excluding Non-GAAP Adjustments. 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting property, plant, and equipment additions from operating cash flows. 
 Refer to the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations," "Income Taxes," and "Free Cash Flow" sections for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by subtracting additions to property, plant, and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. Free cash flow should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) and free cash flow are as follows: 
 Six months ended (in millions) October 25, 2024 October 27, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,944 1,536 Additions to property, plant, and equipment (924) (815) Free cash flow 1,020 721

 (4) Incremental Italian payback accruals resulting from the two July 22, 2024 rulings by the Constitutional Court of Italy relating to certain prior years since 2015. 
 The increase in net sales for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year, was driven primarily by growth in most businesses, including strong growth in Diabetes, Cranial Spinal Technologies, Neuromodulation, TAVR, Cardiac Rhythm Management, and Cardiac Surgery. The increase in net sales for the six months ended October 25, 2024, was partially offset by the 90 million incremental Italian payback accruals resulting from the two July 22, 2024 rulings by the Constitutional Court of Italy relating to certain prior years since 2015. 
 Looking ahead, a number of macro-economic and geopolitical factors could negatively impact our business, including without limitation: 
 Competitive product launches and pricing pressure, geographic macro-economic developments including changes in global trade policies and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, general price inflation, changes in interest rates, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, delays in product registration approvals, replacement cycle challenges, and supply chain challenges from time to time; 
 National and provincial tender pricing for certain products, particularly in China; 
 The sanctions and other measures being imposed in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict are having, and could continue to have impacts on revenue and supply chain. The financial impact of the conflict in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, including on accounts receivable and inventory reserves, was not material, and for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024, the business of the Company in these countries represented less than 1 of the Company's consolidated revenues and assets. Although the implications of this conflict are difficult to predict at this time, the ongoing conflict may increase pressure on the global economy and supply chains, resulting in increased future volatility risk for our business operations and performance. 
 33 

Although the long-term implications of Israel's recent conflicts are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflicts in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, including on accounts receivable and inventory reserves, was not material. As of October 25, 2024, the Company had 6 facilities and approximately 1,500 employees in Israel. For the three and six months ended October 25, 2024, the business of the Company in Israel represented less than 1 of the Company's consolidated revenues and assets.

Medical Surgical's net sales for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 were 2.1 billion and 4.1 billion, an increase of 1 percent and flat, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The net sales were primarily impacted by growth in Advanced Energy and Blood Oxygen Management with partially offsetting declines in Stapling. 
 The graphs below illustrate the percent of Medical Surgical net sales by division for the three months ended October 25, 2024 and October 27, 2023: 
 
 37 

Surgical Endoscopy (SE) net sales for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 increased 1 percent and flat, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The net sales for both periods were impacted by growth in Advanced Energy, driven by continued adoption of the LigaSure Maryland XP vessel sealer, and strength in Hernia and Wound Management products. The net sales results were partially offset by declines in Advanced Stapling and Endoscopy. 
 Acute Care Monitoring (ACM) net sales for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 increased 4 percent and 1 percent, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The net sales increase for both periods was largely due to growth in Nellcor pulse oximetry driven by strong sensor sales and continued adoption of the RespArray patient monitor in addition to strength in Bispectral Index monitoring system (BIS). 
 In addition to the macro-economic and geopolitical factors described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead we expect Medical Surgical could be affected by the following:

 COSTS AND EXPENSES 
 The following is a summary of cost of products sold, research and development, and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 and October 27, 2023: 
 
 Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 was 2.9 billion and 5.7 billion, respectively, as compared to 2.8 billion and 5.4 billion, respectively, for the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The increase in cost products sold as a percentage of net sales for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 was primarily due to unfavorable currency impact. 
 Research and Development Expense We remain committed to deliver the best possible experiences for patients, physicians, and caregivers we serve; to create technologies that expand what s possible across the human body to transform lives; to turn data and insights into real action to serve patient needs, improving care; and to expand healthcare access and deliver positive outcomes. Research and development expense for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 was 697 million and 1.4 billion, respectively, as compared to 698 million and 1.4 billion, respectively, for the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expense Our goal is to continue to leverage selling, general, and administrative expense management initiatives. Selling, general, and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and wages, other administrative costs, such as professional fees and marketing expenses, certain acquisition and divestiture-related costs, and restructuring associated expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expense for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 was 2.8 billion and 5.4 billion, respectively, as compared to 2.7 billion and 5.3 billion, respectively, for the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expense for both periods is primarily due to new product launches and commercialization activities. 
 39 

The following is a summary of other costs and expenses (income): Three months ended Six months ended (in millions) October 25, 2024 October 27, 2023 October 25, 2024 October 27, 2023 Amortization of intangible assets 413 425 827 855 Restructuring charges, net 30 40 77 94 Certain litigation charges, net 65 81 105 Other operating income, net (34) (31) (33) (30) Other non-operating income, net (173) (154) (330) (230) Interest expense, net 209 180 376 329 
 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization expense of our definite-lived intangible assets, consisting of purchased patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and other intangible assets. 
 
 Restructuring Charges, Net For the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 and October 27, 2023, restructuring costs primarily related to employee termination benefits and facility consolidations to support cost reduction initiatives. 
 For additional information about our restructuring activities, refer to Note 5 to the current period's consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Certain Litigation Charges, Net We classify specified certain litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges, net in the consolidated statements of income. For additional information, refer to Note 16 in the current period's consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income, net primarily includes expenses associated with royalties paid for the in-license of intellectual property from third parties, currency remeasurement and derivative gains and losses, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, certain acquisition and divestiture-related items, and income from funded research and development arrangements. 
 For the three and six months ended October 25, 2024, the increase in other operating income, net was largely driven by insignificant gains from certain business or asset sales in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Portfolio. The increase in other operating, income net was partially offset by the net impact of currency remeasurement and our hedging programs, which resulted in net expense of 39 million and 44 million for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024, respectively, as compared to a net gain of 32 million and 29 million, respectively, in the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. 
 
 Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net includes the non-service component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost, investment gains and losses, and interest income. 
 For the three months and six months ended October 25, 2024, the increase in other non-operating income, net is primarily attributable to an increase in net gains on our minority investment portfolio. Net gains on minority investments were 10 million and 27 million for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024, respectively, compared to net losses of 25 million and 89 million for the three and six months ended October 27, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net includes interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts, and amortization of amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of certain net investment and fair value hedges. 
 For the three and six months ended October 25, 2024, the increase in interest expense, net was primarily driven by the 3.0 billion debt issuance on June 3, 2024.

INCOME TAXES 
 Three months ended Six months ended (in millions) October 25, 2024 October 27, 2023 October 25, 2024 October 27, 2023 Income tax provision 281 402 500 802 Income before income taxes 1,559 1,313 2,827 2,510 Effective tax rate 18.0 30.6 17.7 32.0 Non-GAAP income tax provision 366 339 693 640 Non-GAAP income before income taxes 1,995 2,008 3,921 3,910 Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate 18.3 16.9 17.7 16.4 Difference between the effective tax rate and Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate 0.3 (13.7) (15.6) 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15 in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. A number of countries, including Ireland, have enacted legislation to implement the core elements of Pillar Two, which are effective for Medtronic in fiscal year 2025. We will continue to monitor the impacts of further legislation, regulatory guidance, and regulations issued in the countries in which we do business. 
 The Israeli Central-Lod District Court issued its decision in Medtronic Ventor Technologies Ltd (Ventor) v. Kfar Saba Assessing Office on June 1, 2023. The court determined that there was a deemed taxable transfer of intellectual property. As a result, the Company recorded a 187 million income tax charge during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and has filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Israel. 
 Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 was 18.0 and 17.7 , respectively, as compared to 30.6 and 32.0 for the three and six months ended October 27, 2023, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended October 25, 2024 primarily relates to the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net operating losses recorded during the three months ended October 27, 2023, which was partially offset by the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. In addition to the items discussed in the current quarter, the decrease in the effective tax rate for the six months ended October 25, 2024 was also attributable to an income tax reserve adjustment made during the six months ended October 27, 2023 associated with the Ventor court decision noted above. 
 Our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 was 18.3 and 17.7 , respectively, as compared to 16.9 and 16.4 for the three and six months ended October 27, 2023, respectively. The change in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate was primarily due to the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction. An increase in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate of 1 percent would result in an additional income tax provision for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 of approximately 20 million and 39 million, respectively. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We are currently in a strong financial position, and we believe our balance sheet and liquidity as of October 25, 2024 provide us with flexibility, and our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments, along with our credit facility and related commercial paper programs will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs. 
 Our liquidity and capital structure are evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning processes. We consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations, which includes working capital needs, investments in research and development, property, plant, and equipment, and other operating costs. We also consider capital allocation alternatives that balance returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, satisfying maturing debt, and acquiring businesses and technology.

 Six months ended (in millions) October 25, 2024 October 27, 2023 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,944 1,536 Investing activities (604) (963) Financing activities (1,265) (591) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 35 (214) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 110 (232) 
 Operating Activities The 408 million increase in net cash provided was primarily driven by an increase in cash collected from customers due to an increase in sales and a decrease in cash paid to vendors, which was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes and increased annual incentive payouts. 
 Investing Activities The 359 million decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales and maturities of investments of 386 million partially offset by an increase in net additions to property, plant, and equipment of 109 million. 
 Financing Activities There was a 674 million increase in net cash used during the six months ended October 25, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. In the current period, there was a decrease in total short-term borrowings of 67 million, as compared to an increase of 1.3 billion in the prior year. Additionally, on June 3, 2024, Medtronic Inc. issued four tranches of EUR-denominated Senior Notes with an aggregate principal of 3.0 billion, or 3.2 billion, which was partially offset by a 2.3 billion increase in net share repurchases during the six months ended October 25, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. For more information on commercial paper and Senior Notes issued, refer to the Debt and Capital section below. 
 
 Debt and Capital 
 Our capital structure consists of equity and interest-bearing debt. We primarily utilize unsecured senior debt obligations to meet our financing needs and, to a lesser extent, bank borrowings. From time to time, we may repurchase our outstanding debt obligations in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. 
 Total debt at October 25, 2024 was 28.3 billion as compared to 25.0 billion at April 26, 2024. The increase in total debt was primarily driven by issuance of Euro-denominated Senior Notes and fluctuations in exchange rates. 
 On June 3, 2024, Medtronic Inc. issued four tranches of EUR-denominated Senior Notes with an aggregate principal of 3.0 billion, with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2030 to 2054, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately 3.2 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. In anticipation of the Euro-denominated debt issuance, the Company entered into forward currency exchange rate contracts to manage the exposure to exchange rate movements. These contracts were settled in conjunction with the issuance of the June 2024 Notes. 
 We repurchase our ordinary shares on occasion as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders. In March 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 5.0 billion of the Company's ordinary shares. There is no specific time period associated with these repurchase authorizations. During the six months ended October 25, 2024, the Company repurchased a total of 33 million shares under this program at an average price of 82.61. At October 25, 2024, we had approximately 2.6 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. 
 For more information on credit arrangements, refer to Note 7 to the current period's consolidated financial statements and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024. 
 Liquidity 
 Our liquidity sources at October 25, 2024 included 1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 6.6 billion of current investments. Additionally, we maintain commercial paper programs and a Credit Facility. 
 Our investments primarily include available-for-sale debt securities, including U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities. Refer to Note 6 to the current period's consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements. 
 42 

We maintain multicurrency commercial paper programs for short-term financing, which allow us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 3.5 billion. At October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024, we had 899 million and 1.1 billion commercial paper outstanding, respectively. The issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit, as explained below. 
 We also have a 3.5 billion five-year syndicated credit facility (Credit Facility), which expires in December 2028. At each anniversary date of the Credit Facility we can request a one-year extension of the maturity date. The Credit Facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper programs and may also be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional 1.0 billion at any time during the term of the agreement. At October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facility. 
 Interest rates on advances of our Credit Facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our long-term debt ratings assigned by Standard Poor's Ratings Services (S P) and Moody's Investors Service (Moody s). Facility fees are payable on the Credit Facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates. We are in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Facility. 
 The following table is a summary of our S P and Moody's long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings: 
 Agency Rating (1) 
 October 25, 2024 April 26, 2024 Standard Poor's Ratings Services Long-term debt A A Short-term debt A-1 A-1 Moody's Investors Service Long-term debt A3 A3 Short-term debt P-2 P-2 
 (1) Agency ratings are subject to change, and there may be no assurance that an agency will continue to provide ratings and/or maintain its current ratings. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
 S P and Moody's long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings at October 25, 2024 were unchanged as compared to the ratings at April 26, 2024. We do not expect the S P and Moody's ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet, Credit Facility, and related commercial paper programs. 
 We have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business. We believe our off-balance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. Refer to the Debt and Capital section above for changes in debt obligations during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025; there have been no other material changes to our long-term contractual obligations as reported in our most recent Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024. 
 
 ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS 
 Information regarding acquisitions and dispositions activity is included in Note 4 to the current period's consolidated financial statements. 
 
 GOODWILL 
 We assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the third quarter of the fiscal year and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. 
 The Company calculates the excess of each reporting unit's fair value over its carrying amount, including goodwill, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and revenue and earnings multiples using comparable public company information. The test for impairment of goodwill requires the Company to make several estimates related to projected future cash flows and appropriate multiples to determine the fair value of the goodwill reporting units. Significant assumptions used in the reporting unit fair value measurements include forecasted cash flows, including revenue and expense growth rates, discount rates, and revenue and earnings multiples. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. 
 Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. There were no impairments of intangible assets in the current period. Further adverse changes to macroeconomic conditions or significant changes to our current and future expected financial performance could lead to goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods, and such charges could be material to our results of operations. 
 43 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 We have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024. 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation and/or carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
 As of October 25, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates. 
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the current period's consolidated financial statements.

These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements may include statements related to our growth and growth strategies, developments in the markets for our products, therapies and services, financial results, product development launches and effectiveness, research and development strategy, regulatory approvals, competitive strengths, the potential or anticipated direct or indirect impact of public health crises and geopolitical conflicts on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition, restructuring and cost-saving initiatives, intellectual property rights, litigation and tax matters, governmental proceedings and investigations, mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, market acceptance of our products, therapies and services, accounting estimates, financing activities, ongoing contractual obligations, working capital adequacy, value of our investments, our effective tax rate, our expected returns to shareholders, and sales efforts. In some cases, such statements may be identified by the use of terminology such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, looking ahead, may, plan, possible, potential, project, should, will, and similar words or expressions. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: our ability to drive long-term shareholder value; development and future launches of products and continued or future acceptance of products, therapies and services in our segments; expected timing for completion of research studies relating to our products; integration of new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics, into our products, therapies and services; market positioning and performance of our products, including stabilization of certain product markets; divestitures and the potential benefits thereof; the costs and benefits of integrating previous acquisitions; anticipated timing for United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) and non-U.S. regulatory approval of new products; increased presence in new markets, including markets outside the U.S.; changes in the market and our market share; our ability to meet growing demand for our existing products; acquisitions and investment initiatives, including the timing of regulatory approvals as well as integration of acquired companies into our operations; the resolution of tax matters; the effectiveness of our development activities in reducing patient care costs and hospital stay lengths; our approach towards cost containment; our expectations regarding healthcare costs, including potential changes to reimbursement policies and pricing pressures; our expectations regarding changes to patient standards of care; our ability to identify and maintain successful business partnerships; the elimination of certain positions or costs related to restructuring initiatives; outcomes in our litigation matters and governmental proceedings and investigations; general economic conditions; the adequacy of available working capital and our working capital needs; our payment of dividends and redemption of shares; the continued strength of our balance sheet and liquidity; our accounts receivable exposure; our human capital management with respect to our global workforce; and the potential impact of our compliance with governmental regulations and accounting guidance. 
 We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. One must carefully consider forward-looking statements and understand that such forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, and involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among others, those discussed in the sections entitled Government Regulation within Item 1. Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as those related to: 
 competition in the medical device industry, 
 delays in regulatory approvals, 
 public health crises, 
 reduction or interruption in our supply, 
 failure to complete or achieve the intended benefits of acquisitions or divestitures, 
 adverse regulatory action, 
 laws and governmental regulations, 
 litigation results, 
 quality problems, 
 46 

healthcare policy changes, 
 cybersecurity and privacy incidents, 
 international operations, including the impact of armed conflicts, 
 self-insurance, 
 commercial insurance, 
 changes in applicable tax rates, 
 positions taken by taxing authorities, 
 decreasing selling prices and pricing pressure, 
 liquidity shortfalls, 
 fluctuations in currency exchange rates, 
 inflation, or 
 disruption of our current plans and operations. 
 Consequently, no forward-looking statement may be guaranteed, and actual results may vary materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We intend to take advantage of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding our forward-looking statements and are including this sentence for the express purpose of enabling us to use the protections of the safe harbor with respect to all forward-looking statements. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, whether as a result of any new information, future events, or otherwise, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK 
 Due to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes, which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged, such as in certain emerging markets, may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility. The gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024 was 24.6 billion and 23.7 billion, respectively. At October 25, 2024, these contracts were in a net unrealized gain position of 464 million. Additional information regarding our currency exchange rate derivative instruments is included in Note 8 to the current period's consolidated financial statements. 
 A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024 indicates that, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened/weakened by 10 percent against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase/decrease by approximately 1.7 billion. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis. 
 INTEREST RATE RISK 
 We are subject to interest rate risk on our short-term investments and our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs. Our debt portfolio at October 25, 2024 was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros, which is primarily fixed rate debt. We are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments, which include our marketable debt securities. 
 A sensitivity analysis of the impact on our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 50 basis point change in interest rates, as compared to interest rates at October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024, indicates that the fair value of these instruments would correspondingly change by 65 million and 64 million, respectively. 
 For a discussion of current market conditions and the impact on our financial condition and results of operations, please see the Liquidity section of the current period's Management's Discussion and Analysis. For additional discussion of market risk, refer to Notes 6 and 8 to the current period's consolidated financial statements.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) and changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are effective. 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 In accordance with Item 103 of Regulation S-K, we have adopted a 1 million disclosure threshold for proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, as we believe matters under this threshold are not material to the Company. A discussion of the Company s legal proceedings and other loss contingencies are described in Note 16 to the current period's consolidated financial statements.
