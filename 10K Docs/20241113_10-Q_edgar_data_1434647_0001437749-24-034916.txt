ZEVRA THERAPEUTICS, INC. 
 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

m illion and million, respectively, and as of September 30, 2024, has an accumulated deficit of mi llion. The Company has sustained operating losses for the majority of its corporate history and expects to continue to incur operating losses and negative operating cash flows until revenues reach a level sufficient to support ongoing operations. 
 
 The Company s ability to continue operating as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to generate revenue from approved products or obtain product candidate regulatory approvals, which would generate revenue, milestones, and cash flow sufficient to support ongoing operations and the satisfaction of financial covenants. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are being issued. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 
 
 The Company's liquidity needs will be largely determined by the success of operations through the progression of its products and product candidates in the future. The Company also may consider other sources to fund operations including: 1 out-licensing rights to certain of its technologies and product candidates, pursuant to which the Company would receive cash royalties and milestones; 2 raising additional capital through equity or debt financings or from other sources; 3 obtaining product candidate regulatory approvals, which would generate revenue, milestones and cash flow; 4 reducing spending on one or more research and development programs, including by discontinuing development; and/or 5 restructuring operations to change its overhead structure. The Company is in the early stages of its commercialization effort for OLPRUVA and MIPLYFFA and does not yet have a substantial basis to project future earnings, and its other sources of revenue are not sufficient to sustain its present activities on their own. Accordingly, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern may require it to obtain additional financing to fund its operations. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 
 The Company prepared the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and, in the Company's opinion, reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring items that are necessary. 
 
 Merger 
 
 On August 30, 2023, the Company and Aspen Z Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zevra Merger Sub ), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Acer Therapeutics Inc. Acer ), a pharmaceutical company focused on development and commercialization of therapies for rare and life-threatening diseases. On November 17, 2023 the "Closing Date"), the Company completed the acquisition of Acer. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on the Closing Date, Merger Sub was merged with and into Acer (the "Merger"), with Acer continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zevra. In connection therewith, Zevra also purchased Acer s secured debt from Nantahala Capital Management, LLC ("NCM ), certain of its affiliates and certain other parties (collectively with NCM, Nantahala through a series of transactions and Zevra agreed to provide Acer with a bridge loan facility for up to million ("Bridge Loan"), subject to certain terms and conditions. The Merger expanded Zevra's rare disease portfolio, as well as increased and diversified its revenues with the addition of a U.S. commercial asset, OLPRUVA, indicated for the treatment of UCDs. See Note L for further discussion related to the Merger. 

Registration Statements on Form S- 3 
 
 In connection with the Merger, Zevra and Nantahala concurrently entered into a registration rights agreement, pursuant to which Zevra agreed to file a resale registration statement with respect to the resale of the Zevra common stock issuable to Nantahala. On February 5, 2024, Zevra filed a registration statement on Form S- 3 (File No. 333 - 276856 registering an aggregate of shares of Zevra s common stock. On April 5, 2024, we filed an amendment to the registration statement on Form S- 3 (File No. 333 - 250945 covering the issuance of the shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants issued in connection with the Merger (Note L) and remaining unexercised as of the date of the amendment, which was declared effective on April 8, 2024. 
 
 On June 4, 2024, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S- 3 (File No. 333 - 279941 (the "June 2024 Registration Statement") under which the Company may sell securities, including as may be issuable upon conversion, redemption, repurchase, exchange or exercise of securities, in one or more offerings up to a total aggregate offering price of million, million of which was allocated to the sale of the shares of common stock issuable under the 2024 ATM Agreement (as described further below). The registration statement was declared effective on Jun e 13, 2024. 
 
 August 2024 Offering

Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company also granted the Underwriters an option exercisable for 30 days to purchase up to an additional shares of its Common Stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions, which the Underwriters exercised in full on August 9, 2024. The August 2024 Offering closed on August 12, 2024. Total shares issued were . Net proceeds from the offering were approximately 64.5 mi llion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to support the commercial launch activities for MIPLYFFA, continued commercial support for OLPRUVA and the continued development of celiprolol and KP1077 through potential NDA filings and other general corporate purposes. 
 
 Based on the planned use of proceeds, the Company believes that the net proceeds from the August 2024 Offering and its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements int o 2027, su bject to continuing compliance with the Company's debt covenants. 
 
 Entry into 2024 ATM Agreement 
 
 On July 12, 2024, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement (the "2024 ATM Agreement") with Citizens JMP Securities LLC ("Citizens JMP") under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million through Citizens JMP as its sales agent.

These adjustments represent variable consideration under ASC 606 and are recorded as a reduction of revenue. These adjustments are established by management as its best estimate based on available information and will be adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such allowances. Adjustments for variable consideration are determined based on the contractual terms with customers, historical trends, communications with customers and the levels of inventory remining in the distribution channel, as well as expectations about the market for the product and anticipated introduction of competitive products.

million upon the occurrence of specified regulatory milestones related to AZSTARYS, additional fixed payments upon the achievement of specified U.S. sales milestones, and quarterly, tiered royalty payments based on a range of percentages of net sales (as defined in the AZSTARYS License Agreement). Commave is obligated to make such royalty payments on a product-by-product basis until expiration of the royalty term for the applicable product.

The Company concluded that these regulatory milestones, sales milestones and royalty payments each contain a significant uncertainty associated with a future event. As such, these milestone and royalty payments are constrained at contract inception and are 
 not included in the transaction price as the Company could 
 not conclude that it is probable a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will 
 not occur surrounding these milestone paym
 ents. At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates its assessment of whether the milestone and royalty payments are constrained by considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the potential revenue reversal. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million and million of revenue under the AZSTARYS License Agreement, respectively, primarily related to royalties. For the

Product Revenues, Net 

Expanded Access Program 
 
 Net revenue includes revenue from the sale of arimoclomol for the treatment of NPC under the remunerated expanded access compassionate use program in France French nATU ). An expanded access compassionate use program is a program giving specific patients access to a drug, which is not yet approved for commercial sale. Only drugs targeting serious or rare indications and for which there is currently no appropriate treatment are considered for expanded access compassionate use programs. Further, to be considered for the expanded access compassionate use program, the drug must have proven efficacy and safety and must either be undergoing price negotiations or seeking marketing approval. 
 
 In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when fulfilling its performance obligation under the Expanded Access Program ("EAP") by transferring control of promised goods or services to its customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining when the customer obtains control of the product, the Company considers certain indicators, including whether the Company has a present right to payment from the customer, whether title and/or significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer and whether the customer acceptance has been received. Revenue is recognized net of sales deductions, including discounts, rebates, applicable distributor fees, and revenue-based taxes. 

The French Health Authorities and the manufacturer have agreed to a price for sales during the French nATU, but the final transaction price depends on the terms and conditions in the contracts with the French Health Authorities and is subject to price negotiations with the French Health Authorities following market approval. Any excess in the price charged the manufacturer compared to the price agreed with the health authorities once the drug product is approved in France must be repaid. The repayment is considered in the clawback liability (rebate). An estimate of net revenue and clawback liability are recognized using the expected value method. Accounting for net revenue and clawback liability requires determination of the most appropriate method for the expected final transaction price. This estimate also requires assumptions with respect to inputs into the method, including current pricing of comparable marketed products within the rare disease area in France. Management has considered the expected final sales price as well as the price of similar drug products. The Company is operating within a rare disease therapeutic area where there is unmet treatment need and hence a limited number of comparable commercialized drugs products. The limited available relevant market information for directly comparable commercialized drugs within rare disease increases the uncertainty in management's estimate.

For the

In May 2011, Orphazyme entered into an asset purchase agreement with LadRx Corporation, which was assigned to XOMA (US) LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of XOMA Corporation ("XOMA"), in June 2023 "XOMA License Agreement"). Under the XOMA License Agreement, XOMA is entitled to certain net sales and regulatory milestone payments in addition to a mid-single digit royalty with respect to sales of MIPLYFFA. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a regulatory milestone payment of million due to XOMA under the XOMA License Agreement, which is included in intangible assets, net in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Amendment to IP License Agreement and IP Termination Agreement - As a condition to entering into the Merger Agreement, Acer and Relief entered into the Exclusive License Agreement and the Termination Agreement terminating the collaboration and license agreement, dated March 19, 2021, by and between Acer and Relief. Pursuant to the Exclusive License Agreement, Relief holds exclusive development and commercialization rights for OLPRUVA in Geographical Europe. Acer has the right to receive a royalty of up to of the net sales of OLPRUVA in Geographical Europe. In accordance with the terms of the Termination Agreement, Relief received an upfront payment from Acer of million (which payment was funded with the Bridge Loan described above) with an additional payment of million due on the first -year anniversary of the million payment. Acer also agreed to pay a royalty on net sales of OLPRUVA worldwide, excluding Geographical Europe, and of any value received by Acer from certain third parties relating to OLPRUVA licensing or divestment rights, all of the foregoing which are capped at million, for total payments to Relief of up to million. 

In connection with the closing of the Merger on November 17, 2023, each share of common stock of Acer was converted into the right to receive (i) fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of Zevra, par value per share, and (ii) one non-transferable CVR to be issued by Zevra, which will represent the right to receive one or more contingent payments up to an additional million upon the achievement, if any, of certain commercial and regulatory milestones for Acer s OLPRUVA and celiprolol products within specified time periods. Certain additional cash payments are also possible pursuant to the CVRs with respect to milestones involving Acer s early-stage program ACER- 2820 (emetine). 

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded based on their acquisition date fair values. Consideration for the Merger was million and consists of (i) approximately million shares of Zevra common stock valued at million, (ii) the Bridge Loan advances of million, (iii) million in cash paid to Nantahala; (iv) million shares of Zevra Common Stock issued to Nantahala valued at million based on the VWAP of shares of Zevra Common Stock during the consecutive trading days ending on the trading date prior to August 30, 2023; v) a secured promissory note payable by Zevra to Nantahala in the original principal amount of million, as disclosed in Note C, (vi) million in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to the CVRs, (vii) approximately million shares of Zevra Common Stock issued to a former holder of Acer warrants valued at million based on Zevra's common stock price on the Effective Date and (viii) million in notes payable paid by the Company on Acer's behalf. In addition, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, all of the outstanding and unexercised Acer stock options were automatically cancelled and ceased to exist without any cash or other consideration being paid or provided in respect thereof. The following purchase price allocation reflects the preliminary estimates of and assumptions related to the fair values of assets acq uired and liabilities assumed: 

Prepaid expenses 
 Other current assets 
 Inventory 
 Property, plant, and equipment 
 Other noncurrent assets 
 Approved product - OLPRUVA 
 IPR D - celiprolol 
 Goodwill acquired 

Liabilities 
 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 
 Deferred collaboration funding 
 Operating lease liabilities 
 
 Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired 

The preliminary fair values assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using an income approach based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including third -party valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. These preliminary fair values are subject to change within the one -year measurement period. The estimated fair values were developed by discounting future net cash flows to their present value at market-based rates of return. The goodwill acquired represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the business acquired. The useful lives of the intangible assets for amortization purposes were determined by considering the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair values of the intangible assets adjusted as appropriate for entity-specific factors including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic and other factors that may limit the useful life. The marketed product asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. As of September 30, 2024, the in-process research and development ("IPR D") project had not been completed or abandoned and, therefore, the IPR D intangible asset is not currently subject to amortization. 
 
 The results of operations and changes in stockholders' equity for Acer were included in the Company's consolidated financial statements beginning November 18, 2023. 
 
 The following pro forma combined r esults of operations present the acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2023. The pro forma combined results of operations do not necessarily represent the Company's consolidated results of operations had the acquisition occurred on the date assumed, nor are these results necessarily indicative of the Company's future consolidated results of operations. The Company expects to realize certain benefits from integrating Acer into the Company and to incur certain one -time costs. The pro forma combined results of operations do not reflect these benefits or costs. 

Pro forma net loss 

Cancellation of Acer Warrant 
 
 On November 22, 2023, the Company sold an aggregate of shares of its common stock to a healthcare focused investment fund (the "Investor") to cancel a warrant held by the Investor to purchase shares of common stock of Acer. The shares of common stock were offered and sold to the Investor in a registered direct offering without an underwriter or placement agent. 
 
 Contingent Consideration 
 
 Contingent consideration liabilities relate to our liabilities arising in connection with the CVRs issued as a result of the Merger. The contingent consideration is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value is measured based on a Monte Carlo simulation or a scenario-based method, depending on the earn-out achievement objectives, utilizing projections about future performance. Significant inputs include volatility and projected financial information, including projections representative of a market participant's view of the expected cash payments associated with the agreed upon regulatory milestones based on probabilities of technical success, timing of the potential milestone events for the compounds, and estimated discount rates.

In accordance with its policy, the Company reviews the estimated useful lives of its intangible assets on an ongoing basis. This review indicated that based on recent facts and circumstances, including detailed analysis on sales experience and prospective product strategy, the actual life of the definite-lived intangible asset related to OLPRUVA was longer than the estimated useful life previously established at the acquisition of the asset. As a result, effective

Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a commercial-stage company focused on addressing unmet needs for the treatment of rare diseases. Our mission is to bring life changing therapeutics to people living with rare diseases. With unique, data-driven development and commercialization strategies, we are overcoming complex drug development challenges to make new therapies available to the rare disease community. We have a diverse portfolio of products and product candidates, which includes a clinical stage pipeline and commercial stage assets. Our team has specialized expertise and a track record of success in advancing promising therapies that face complex clinical and regulatory challenges with an approach that balances science and data with patient need. 
 
 Following the U.S. approval of AZSTARYS (further described below) in March 2021, we undertook a strategic process to evaluate how to leverage and potentially augment the Company s existing capabilities while also considering where to invest in our pipeline to generate long-term shareholder value. With a track record of drug development success leading to approvals for products which had either difficult pathways to approval or where approvals were won following a complete response letter CRL from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the Company determined to focus its expertise on rare disease indications, as well as seeking value-creating opportunities by building and directly commercializing product candidates in lieu of an out-licensing model. We are executing on this balanced approach by building a culture that is patient-focused and driven by our commitment to developing and making available therapies which address the myriad unmet needs within the rare disease community. 
 
 As part of our commitment to serving the rare disease community, in February 2023, we changed our name to Zevra Therapeutics, Inc. Our name, Zevra, is the Greek word for zebra, which is the internationally recognized symbol for rare disease. This name reflects our intense focus and dedication to developing transformational, patient-focused therapies for rare diseases with limited or no treatment options available, or treatment areas with significant unmet needs. 
 
 In May 2022, we purchased all of the assets and operations of Orphazyme A/S ("Orphazyme") related to arimoclomol, settled all of Orphazyme s actual outstanding liabilities to its creditors with a cash payment of 12.8 million, and agreed to assume an estimated reserve clawback liability of 5.2 million related to revenue generated from Orphazyme s Expanded Access Program in France (the "EAP"). 
 
 On November 17, 2023, Zevra completed the acquisition of Acer Therapeutics, Inc. ("Acer"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Acer continues as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zevra (the Merger"). The Merger included the acquisition of OLPRUVA (sodium phenylbutyrate) for oral suspension, which was approved by the FDA on December 27, 2022, for the treatment of certain urea cycle disorders ("UCDs"). Acer also had a pipeline of investigational product candidates, including celiprolol for the treatment of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ("VEDS") in patients with a confirmed type III collagen (COL3A1) mutation. At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of common stock of Acer, par value 0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding cancelled shares and any shares held by holders who have exercised their appraisal rights) were converted into the right to receive (i) 0.1210 fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of Zevra, par value 0.0001 per share, and (ii) one non-transferable contingent value right CVR issued by Zevra, which represents the right to receive one or more contingent payments up to an additional 76.0 million upon the achievement, if any, of certain commercial and regulatory milestones for Acer s OLPRUVA and celiprolol products within specified time periods. Certain additional cash payments are also possible pursuant to the CVRs with respect to milestones involving Acer s early-stage program ACER-2820 (emetine). 
 
 On September 20, 2024, the FDA approved the New Drug Application NDA") for MIPLYFFA (arimoclomol), an orally-delivered treatment for Niemann-Pick disease type C NPC"), which is an ultra-rare and progressive neurodegenerative disease. MIPLYFFA, the first FDA-approved treatment for NPC, is indicated for use in combination with miglustat for the treatment of neurological manifestations of NPC in adult and pediatric patients two years of age and older. In addition, we received a transferable rare pediatric disease priority review voucher in conjunction with the approval. MIPLYFFA has also been granted orphan medical product designation for the treatment of NPC by the European Commission. 
 
 Now focused on late-stage clinical development and commercial opportunities, Zevra has discontinued its in-house drug discovery activities and is closing its laboratory facilities in Iowa and Virginia at the end of the third quarter. Future early research and development activities will be outsourced. 
 
 To accomplish our mission, we are seeking to further expand our pipeline through both internal development and through our business development activities to collaborate, partner, and potentially acquire additional assets. We intend to target assets that will allow us to leverage the expertise and infrastructure that we have built to help mitigate risk and enhance our probability of success. In addition, we may consider external opportunities within neurology and neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and other rare diseases, along with adjacent or related therapeutic categories. If we are successful, expanding our pipeline could be accretive to our value proposition and has the potential to create incremental long-term value for stockholders. 
 
 Our recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue operating as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to generate revenue from approved products or obtain product candidate regulatory approvals, which would generate revenue, milestones, and cash flow sufficient to support ongoing operations and the satisfaction of financial covenants. We are early in our commercialization effort for OLPRUVA and MIPLYFFA and do not yet have a substantial basis to project future earnings, and our other sources of revenue are not sufficient to sustain our present activities on their own. Accordingly, our ability to continue as a going concern may require us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations. The perception of our inability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, suppliers and employees. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt, the terms of these securities may restrict our ability to operate. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or altogether cease our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.

Our Product Candidates and Approved Products 
 
 We have built a diverse portfolio of products and product candidates through a combination of internal development and strategic investments through acquisition. For example, we have employed our proprietary Ligand Activated Technology ("LAT") platform to develop approved products (e.g., AZSTARYS), and clinical development candidate (KP1077IH and KP1077N). Through our business development efforts, we have added commercial products (OLPRUVA and MIPLYFFA), and a clinical development candidate (celiprolol). We furthermore have a variety of product candidates and compounds that are clinical-stage and designed to address a variety of rare diseases and other indications.

These anticipated milestones are based on information currently available to us. Our current plans and expectations are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other important factors that could materially impact our plans, including risks which are not solely within our control. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, as updated by Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 OLPRUVA 
 
 OLPRUVA (sodium phenylbutyrate) for oral suspension is approved in the U.S. as adjunctive therapy to standard of care, which includes dietary management, for the chronic management of UCDs involving deficiencies of carbamylphosphate synthetase (CPS), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), orargininosuccinic acid synthetase (AS). OLPRUVA is a proprietary and novel formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate powder, packaged in pre-measured single-dose envelopes, that has shown bioequivalence to existing sodium phenylbutyrate powder but with a pH-sensitive polymer coating that is designed to minimize dissolution of the coating for up to five minutes after preparation. 
 
 UCDs are a group of rare, genetic disorders that can cause harmful ammonia to build up in the blood, potentially resulting in brain damage and neurocognitive impairments, if ammonia levels are not controlled. Any increase in ammonia over time is serious. Therefore, it is important to adhere to any dietary protein restrictions and have alternative medication options to help control ammonia levels. Approximately 1 in 100,000 people have UCD, and there are an estimated 800 patients who are actively treated with nitrogen scavenging therapy in the U.S. While there are therapies currently approved for the treatment of UCDs - specifically RAVICTI , marketed by Amgen, Inc. (formerly Horizon Therapeutics) and PHEBURANE , marketed by Medunik USA - there remain unmet needs for this community of patients. OLPRUVA offers benefits over other UCD treatments by eliminating issues with palatability, offering improved portability with its single-dose envelopes, and it comes in a dosage that is personalized to the patient based on weight. 
 
 To commercialize OLPRUVA for oral suspension in the U.S. we have built marketing, sales, medical affairs, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or is making arrangements with third parties to perform these services. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we began generating revenue from the sale of OLPRUVA in the U.S. For additional information regarding the Merger, see Note L of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Zevra has a partnership with Relief Therapeutics who has rights to commercialize OLPRUVA in various European Union [EU] countries, if approved. In addition, Zevra pays royalties of 10 of U.S. net sales plus milestones to Relief Therapeutics. 
 
 During the first half of 2024, we initiated the commercial launch of OLPRUVA in the U.S. We have focused our initial efforts on the approximately 40 metabolic treatment centers of excellence across the United States which treat the majority of UCD patients to build awareness with physicians regarding the benefits of OLPRUVA. In the months since launch, our team has been able to engage with more than 90 of our customers. We have seen meaningful growth in reimbursement coverage, which was approximately 55 of U.S. covered lives at the time of acquisition, to now approximately 76 . Zevra is refining its commercial strategy for OLPRUVA to focus on specific patient segments where there are fewer access barriers, and, to increase awareness through targeted patient education campaigns. 
 
 OLPRUVA summary: 

OLPRUVA is available in the U.S for the treatment of UCD. OLPRUVA is an adjunctive therapy for long-term management of adults and children weighing 20kg or greater with UCD from deficiencies of CPS, OTC, or AS. 

OLPRUVA is differentiated from currently available forms of phenylbutyrate. OLPRUVA is formulated to improve palatability while providing patients with a portable and discrete pre-measured dose. 

Zevra has assembled a team to support OLPRUVA and additional future commercial products. We have established an efficient commercial team which is designed to fully service the patients and prescribers within the rare disease indications we are pursuing.

MIPLYFFA (arimoclomol) 
 
 On September 20, 2024, the FDA approved the NDA for MIPLYFFA, an orally-delivered treatment for NPC , which is an ul tra-rare and progressive neurodegenerative disease . MIPLYFFA, t he first FDA-approved treatment for NPC , is indicated for use in combination with miglustat for the treatment of neurological manifestations of NPC in adult and pediatric patients two years of age and older. In addition, we received a transferable rare pediatric disease priority review voucher PRV in conjunction with the approval. MIPLYFFA has also been granted orphan medical product designation for the treatment of NPC by the European Commission. 
 
 NPC is characterized by an inability of the body to transport cholesterol and lipids inside of cells. Symptoms of NPC include a progressive impairment of mobility, cognition, speech, and swallowing, often culminating in premature death. The incidence of NPC is estimated to be one in 100,000 to 130,000 live births. We estimate that there are approximately 1,800 individuals with NPC in the U.S. and Europe, of these, approximately 300 have been diagnosed in the U.S. However, diagnostic challenges may affect the number of potential patients, and we believe that the availability of treatment options could increase awareness of the disease and assist in more accurately identifying patients. Effective therapies to treat NPC are desperately needed, and for this reason, MIPLYFFA is currently being made available to NPC patients in France, Germany, and other EU member states under various expanded access programs ("EAPs"). 
 
 Zevra holds global rights to develop and commercialize MIPLYFFA. We intend to seek regulatory approval in the E.U., and we are currently evaluating the potential to commercialize outside of the U.S., and/or to seek additional regulatory approvals to support future global commercialization opportunities. 
 
 MIPLYFFA summary: 

Demonstrated halting of disease progression. MIPLYFFA in combination with miglustat has demonstrated a halting of progression of the disease through 12 months of treatment. 

Ease of flexible administration as an oral treatment. MIPLYFFA is administered as an oral capsule that can be swallowed whole, opened and contents mixed with foods or liquids, or delivered through a feeding tube. 

Extensive clinical experience with favorable safety data. No significant safety findings have been reported with more than 600 patients treated in various clinical trials and through our EAPs. 

Advantageous regulatory designations. MIPLYFFA has been granted orphan medical product designation for the treatment of NPC by the European Commission. We received a transferable PRV upon approval of MIPLYFFA. 

Celiprolol 
 
 The Merger with Acer included the acquisition of celiprolol. We are advancing celiprolol as an investigational product candidate for the treatment of VEDS in patients with a confirmed type III collagen COL3A1 mutation. Celiprolol is a selective adrenergic modulator SAM and, if we receive the first approval in the U.S. for celiprolol, we believe it would be deemed a new chemical entity NCE in the U.S. Celiprolol is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of hypertension and angina. 
 
 Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the genes responsible for the structure, production, or processing of collagen, an important component of the connective tissues in the human body, or proteins that interact with collagen. VEDS causes abnormal fragility in blood vessels, which can give rise to aneurysms, abnormal connections between blood vessels known as arteriovenous fistulas, arterial dissections, and spontaneous vascular ruptures, all of which can be potentially life-threatening. The incidence of VEDS is estimated to be one in 50,000 to 200,000 people. There are approximately 7,500 patients in the U.S. 
 
 Currently, there are no approved therapies anywhere in the world for VEDS. However, celiprolol, prescribed off label, has become the standard of care therapy for VEDS in some European countries. Medical intervention for VEDS focuses on surgery, symptomatic treatment, genetic counseling, and prophylactic measures, such as avoiding intense physical activity, scuba diving, and violent sports. Therefore, patients must adopt a watch and wait approach following any confirmed diagnosis. Unfortunately, many of these arterial events have high mortality associated with them, and thus, a pharmacologic intervention that reduces the rate of events would be clinically meaningful. 
 
 Celiprolol received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of VEDS in 2015. In October 2018, a new celiprolol NDA was submitted to the FDA by Acer based on data obtained from the BBEST trial and was subsequently accepted by the FDA in October 2018 with priority review status. Following FDA review, Acer received a CRL from the FDA stating that it will be necessary to conduct an adequate and well-controlled trial to determine whether celiprolol reduces the risk of clinical events in patients with VEDS. Subsequently, Acer appealed the FDA decision, and while the FDA denied the appeal, it described possible paths forward toward approval. In a May 2021 Type B meeting with the FDA, Acer discussed the conduct of an U.S.-based prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, decentralized clinical trial in patients with COL3A1 positive VEDS, and sought the FDA s opinion on various proposed design features of the study. 

29

Table of Contents 

Based on FDA's feedback during the Type B meeting, we adopted a decentralized (virtual) event-based clinical trial design and use of an independent centralized adjudication committee with a primary endpoint based on clinical events associated with disease outcome. In April 2022, the FDA granted celiprolol Breakthrough Therapy designation BTD in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with COL3A1-positive VEDS. 
 
 In July 2022, Acer initiated enrollment in a Phase 3 long-term event-driven clinical trial designed based on the discussions from the May 2021 Type B meeting with the FDA, also known as the DiSCOVER trial. The DiSCOVER trial intends to enroll 150 VEDS patients, with 100 patients receiving celiprolol and 50 patients receiving placebo. Recruitment in the Phase-3 trial was restarted earlier this year after a brief hiatus and the trial is actively enrolling patients. We believe that celiprolol could address significant unmet needs as there are currently no approved treatments for VEDS in the U.S. 
 
 Celiprolol summary: 

Currently, no approved treatments for VEDS in the U.S. There are currently no approved treatments of VEDS in the U.S. and we believe that celiprolol, if approved, could be a significant innovation in the treatment of VEDS in the U.S. where current treatment options are focused primarily on surgical intervention. 

Unique pharmacological profile. Mechanism of action in VEDS patients is thought to be through vascular dilatation and smooth muscle relaxation, the effect of which is to reduce the mechanical stress on collagen fibers in the arterial wall, and thereby potentially less incidence of vascular ruptures. 

Evidence of efficacy in the EU and extensive clinical experience from multiple trials. Celiprolol has become the primary treatment for VEDS patients in several European countries. BBEST Clinical Trial data showed 76 reduction in risk of arterial events observed in COLA3A1+ subpopulation, with additional data from a long-term observational study in France. 

Regulatory designations. Celiprolol for VEDS would be considered an NCE in the U.S. and has been granted Orphan Drug designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation. 

Solid patent protection through 2038. Celiprolol is generally protected by U.S. patents that will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible term extensions, in 2038. 

KP1077 
 
 KP1077 is being developed and evaluated for the treatment of IH and narcolepsy. IH is a rare neurological sleep disorder affecting approximately 37,000 patients in the United States. The cardinal feature of IH is excessive daytime sleepiness ("EDS"), characterized by daytime lapses into sleep, or an irrepressible need to sleep that persists even with adequate or prolonged nighttime sleep. Additionally, those with IH have extreme difficulty waking, otherwise known as sleep inertia, suffer from severe and debilitating brain fog, and may fall asleep unintentionally or at inappropriate times, also known as narcolepsy. These symptoms often further lead to reported memory problems, difficulty maintaining focus, and depression. 
 
 There is currently only one approved product for the treatment of IH, XYWAV , developed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals. A second product, WAKIX , developed by Harmony Biosciences and originally approved for the treatment of EDS or cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy, but in October 2023, Harmony announced that the difference in outcome for EDS when comparing WAKIX and placebo in its Phase 3 trial with IH patients did not reach statistical significance. Prescribers also utilize narcolepsy medications and various stimulant products off-label to treat IH symptoms, with methylphenidate, a stimulant which has been classified by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance, being one of the most commonly used stimulants for treating IH. While each of these medications can help to address certain IH symptoms, there are also potential shortcomings, including dosing inconvenience, serious adverse events, such as elevated blood pressure and heart rate, and significant drug-to-drug interactions ("DDIs"), including with medications used to manage contraception and depression. In addition, patients have indicated that the effectiveness of their current medication was poor. 
 
 Narcolepsy is a rare, chronic, debilitating neurologic disorder of sleep-wake state instability that impacts up to 200,000 Americans and is primarily characterized by EDS and cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone while a person is awake) along with other manifestations of rapid eye movement ("REM"), sleep dysregulation, which intrude into wakefulness. In most patients, narcolepsy is caused by the loss of hypocretin, a neuropeptide in the brain that supports sleep-wake state stability. Typical symptom onset occurs in adolescence or young adulthood, but it can take up to a decade to be properly diagnosed. Although there are several approved medications for narcolepsy, we believe a treatment option based on serdexmethylphenidate SDX ), our proprietary prodrug of d-MPH which has previously been classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance, with superior exposure/duration characteristics and low abuse potential may be beneficial. 
 
 We reported top-line data from a Phase 1 proof-of-concept study of SDX in the fourth quarter of 2021 and final data for the Phase 1 proof-of-concept study of SDX in the first quarter of 2022. The proof-of-concept study was a dose-escalation study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic stimulant effects, and safety of single oral doses of SDX in subjects with a history of high-dose stimulant use. In the trial, 240 mg and 360 mg doses of SDX were observed to be well-tolerated and produced d-MPH exposure that appeared to increase proportionally with dose. Mean d-MPH plasma concentrations showed a gradual increase after SDX administration, reaching a broad peak from eight to twelve hours post-dose, followed by a shallow decline thereafter. Increased wakefulness, alertness, hypervigilance, and insomnia effects were reported by study participants, which we believe suggests that SDX produced targeted pharmacodynamic effects that have the potential to benefit patients with IH and other sleep disorders. In November 2022, we announced that the FDA has granted the orphan drug designation to SDX for the treatment of IH. 
 
 In January 2022, we announced that we had selected KP1077 for the treatment of IH and narcolepsy as our lead clinical development candidate. KP1077 utilizes SDX, our prodrug of d-MPH, as its API. During the first quarter of 2022, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial comparing the cardiovascular safety of SDX to immediate-release and long-acting formulations of RITALIN , a commonly prescribed central nervous system ("CNS") stimulant. In September 2022, we announced topline data from our exploratory Phase 1 clinical trial, which showed the potential for higher dose formulations of SDX to be safe and well tolerated while avoiding the potential for greater cardiovascular safety risk compared to immediate-release and long-acting formulations of Ritalin.

Based on the data, in December 2022, we announced the initiation of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, dose-optimizing, multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of KP1077 for the treatment of IH. The trial concluded in March 2024 and provided meaningful information of the optimal dose and dosing regimen to inform Phase 3 trial design. 
 
 We enrolled 48 adult patients with IH in more than 30 centers in the United States. Part 1 of the trial consisted of a five-week open-label titration phase during which patients were optimized to one of four doses of SDX (80, 160, 240, or 320 mg/day). Part 2 of the trial entailed a two-week randomized, double-blind, withdrawal phase, during which two-thirds of the trial participants will continue to receive their optimized dose while the remaining one-third will receive placebo. Participants were further assigned into two evenly divided cohorts. The first cohort received a single daily dose just before bedtime, and the second cohort received half the daily dose shortly after awakening and half the daily dose prior to bedtime. 
 
 Clinically meaningful improvements were observed across all studied endpoints. The trial was not powered for statistical significance, and this was not the primary endpoint. The exploratory endpoints of sleep inertia and brain fog performed in-line with expectations and were stable when compared across a variety of other endpoints. Symptom improvements in patients receiving KP1077 were similar after both once-per-day, and twice-per-day dosing. 
 
 In the Phase 2 trial, KP1077 was observed to be well-tolerated at all dose levels and both dosing regimens, with adverse events that are typical for stimulants and mostly mild in severity. These results are consistent with data from the Phase 1 trial with SDX that indicated no greater cardiovascular safety risk despite higher overall exposure levels when compared to both immediate and long-acting methylphenidate products currently used off-label for the treatment of IH. The trial concluded in March 2024 and provided meaningful information of the optimal dose and dosing regimen to inform Phase 3 trial design. On June 3, 2024, we announced final results from the Phase 2 Clinical Trial of KP1077 for IH. The proof-of-concept study was designed to demonstrate safety and tolerability and was not powered to demonstrate statistical significance. However, the trial included several important secondary and exploratory endpoints, such as the change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale ("ESS") total score, the IH Severity Scale ("IHSS"), the Sleep Inertia Visual Analog Scale ("SIVAS"), and a new scale to assess the symptoms and severity of brain fog. These da ta gathered from the secondary endpoints will help inform the study design for a potential Phase 3 clinical trial of KP1077. We held the end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in September 2024, to discuss the design of a pivotal Phase 3 trial to study KP1077 in IH. 
 
 Key Takeaways from Phase 2 Clinical Trial of KP 1077 for Idiopathic Hypersomnia include: 

KP1077 was well tolerated at all dose levels evaluated in the trial, including the highest dose of 320 mg daily, regardless of the dosing regimen: once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). 

o 
 Adverse events (AEs) were similar to other methylphenidate products 

o 
 Most common AEs included insomnia, headache, anxiety, decreased appetite, and nausea 

o 
 Most AEs occurred during the titration period, were mild, and did not lead to early discontinuation 

KP1077 produced clinically meaningful improvements in EDS as assessed by change from baseline in the ESS during both the 5-week open-label (OL) titration period which was maintained during the 2-week double-blind withdrawal period for both dosing regimens. 

o 
 Mean total ESS scores decreased by approximately 9 points after 5 weeks of OL treatment. 

At the end of 7 weeks of treatment, patients administered KP1077 showed clinically meaningful benefits in change from baseline for the ESS, IHSS, SIVAS, and Brain Fog Scale (BFS): 

o 
 Mean total ESS score decreased by 9.4 (QD) and 8.8 (BID) 

o 
 Mean total IHSS score decreased by 16.1 (QD) and 12.3 (BID) 

o 
 Mean SIVAS score decreased by 25.9 (QD) and 17.2 (BID) 

o 
 Mean total BFS symptom score decreased by 23.8 (QD) and 22.3 (BID) 

The study successfully fulfilled the objectives of providing key information for the design of a pivotal efficacy trial, and the results of the secondary efficacy endpoints were supportive of initiating a Phase 3 trial of KP1077. 

We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers to assess proposed dosing regimen for the narcolepsy indication. We are leveraging the data from the study and the IH program in evaluating the potential to initiate a Phase 3 trial in narcolepsy. 
 
 As discussed above, we recently completed an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA who indicated that a single pivotal study with appropriate confirmatory evidence will be sufficient to submit a new NDA. We are evaluating strategic alternatives to advance clinical development toward NDA submission and later, commercialization. 
 
 KP1077 is subject to the terms and conditions of the AZSTARYS License Agreement (as defined below) but is not currently licensed to Commave thereunder. 
 
 KP1077 Summary: 

No drug-to-drug interactions. We have not observed drug-to-drug interactions in clinical drug-drug interaction studies. 

Potential for reduced abuse potential as a Schedule IV controlled substance. All other methylphenidate-based products have been designated as Schedule II controlled substances, which indicates stricter control over the prescribing and use of such products. KP1077 is based on SDX, which has been designated a Schedule IV controlled substance. 

No currently approved generic equivalent product. KP1077 contains SDX, our proprietary prodrug of d-methylphenidate, also known as the new chemical name, serdexmethylphenidate, by the U.S. Adopted Names Council of the American Medical Association USAN ), which means that there may be no generic equivalent product for KP1077 in most U.S. states, making drug-equivalent substitution potentially difficult at the pharmacy. 

Orphan drug designation. Because small size of the IH patient population, the FDA has granted KP1077 orphan drug designation for the treatment of IH. We believe KP1077 may potentially be eligible for fast-track and breakthrough therapy designation, which may provide various regulatory benefits for the development program.

AZSTARYS (Partnered product) 
 
 AZSTARYS contains d-MPH and our prodrug of dexmethylphenidate, SDX. On March 2, 2021, the FDA approved AZSTARYS as a once-daily treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in patients age six years and older. AZSTARYS is currently being marketed in the U.S. under our September 2019 collaboration and license agreement, or the AZSTARYS License Agreement, with Commave. Under the AZSTARYS License Agreement, we granted to Commave an exclusive, worldwide license, to develop, manufacture, and commercialize AZSTARYS and any of our product candidates containing SDX and used to treat ADHD or any other CNS disease. In July 2020, we entered into the consulting agreement with Corium, Inc. ("Corium") (the Corium Consulting Agreement ), under which Corium and Commave, respectively, engaged us to guide the product development and regulatory activities for certain current and potential future products in their portfolio, as well as continue supporting preparation for the potential commercial launch of AZSTARYS. 
 
 Commave has tasked Corium, another affiliate of Gurnet Point Capital, L.P., to lead all commercialization activities for AZSTARYS in the U.S. Corium commercially launched AZSTARYS in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2021. In December 2021, Commave entered into a sublicense of commercialization rights for AZSTARYS in greater China to Shanghai Ark Biopharmaceutical Ltd. 
 
 Pursuant to the AZSTARYS License Agreement, Commave agreed to pay up to 63.0 million in milestone payments upon the occurrence of specified regulatory milestones related to AZSTARYS, including FDA approval and specified conditions with respect to the final approval label. In addition, Corium agreed to make additional payments upon the achievement of specified U.S. sales milestones of up to 420 million in the aggregate. Further, Commave will pay us quarterly, tiered royalty payments based on a percentage of net sales on a product-by-product basis. Corium also agreed to be responsible for and reimburse us for all of development, commercialization and regulatory expenses for any products or product candidates containing SDX, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the AZSTARYS License Agreement, including consultation fees to be paid to us for services provided to Corium in performing such activities. 
 
 In April 2021, we entered into the AZSTARYS Amendment. Pursuant to the AZSTARYS Amendment, we and Commave agreed to modify the compensation terms of the AZSTARYS License Agreement. Commave paid us 10.0 million in connection with the execution of the AZSTARYS Amendment following the FDA approval of AZSTARYS in the United States. Corium also paid us 10.0 million following the SDX scheduling determination by the DEA, which occurred on May 7, 2021. In addition, the AZSTARYS Amendment increased the total remaining future regulatory and sales milestone payments related to AZSTARYS up to an aggregate of 590.0 million. The AZSTARYS License Agreement will continue on a product-by-product basis (i) until expiration of the royalty term for the applicable product candidate in the United States and (ii) perpetually for all other countries. 
 
 In May 2021, we announced that SDX, our proprietary prodrug of d-MPH and the primary active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") in AZSTARYS, was classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the DEA. AZSTARYS is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance as its formulation includes a 70:30 mixture of SDX (Schedule IV) and d-MPH (Schedule II), respectively. 
 
 During the first half of 2023, annual net sales of AZSTARYS surpassed 25 million, triggering the first annual net sales milestone payment of 5.0 million under the AZSTARYS License Agreement, which was earned and recognized as revenue in the second quarter of 2023, and received after quarter-end. During the second half of 2023, annual net sales of AZSTARYS surpassed 50 million, triggering the second net sales milestone payment of 10.0 million under the AZSTARYS License Agreement, which was earned and recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expenses increased by 5.3 million, from 28.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , to 33.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . This increase was primarily driven by an increase in personnel-related costs and an increase in third-party research and development costs related to celiprolol, partially offset by a decrease in research and development costs related to a product for which the NDA was withdrawn during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 19.0 mill ion, from 19.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , to 38.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . T he period-over-period increase was primarily related to an increase in personnel costs and fees associated with our commercial and business development activities. 
 
 Other Income 
 
 Other income decreased by 6.5 million, fro m 8.3 million for t he nine months ended September 30, 2023 , to 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of 4.4 million, a decrease in interest and other income of 2.1 million, and a decrease in the fair value adjustment related to investments of 0.4 million, partially offset by an increase in fair value adjustment related to warrant and CVR liability o f 0.4 million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 Through September 30, 2024, we have funded our research and development and operating activities primarily through the issuance of debt and equity and from revenue received under the EAP, AZSTARYS License Agreement, OLPRUVA product sales and consulting arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of 95.5 millio n. 
 
 To date, we have generated revenue from the EAP, AZSTARYS License Agreement, reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party costs, the performance of consulting services, and sales of OLPRUVA. 
 
 We have had recurring negative net operating cash flows and we anticipate that we may continue to incur minimal positive net cash flows from operations or negative net cash flows from operations for at least the next several years. We expect that our sources of revenue will be through payments arising from our license agreement with Commave, the EAP, sales of OLPRUVA and MIPLYFFA and other potential consulting arrangements and any other future arrangements related to one of our product candidates. 
 
 We filed a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the sale of the shares of our common stock up to 350.0 million, 75.0 million of which was allocated to the sales of the shares of common stock issuable under the Equity Distribution Agreement (described below). The Form S-3 was declared effective on July 12, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, no shares had been issued or sold under the Equity Distribution Agreement and this registration statement under S-3 expired on Jul y 12, 20 24. 
 
 On June 4, 2024, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279941) (the "June 2024 Registration Statement") under which we may sell securities, including as may be issuable upon conversion, redemption, repurchase, exchange or exercise of securities, in one or more offerings up to a total aggregate offering price of 350.0 million, 75.0 million of which was allocated to the sales of the shares of common stock issuable under the 2024 ATM Agreement (as described further below). The registration statement was declared effective on June 13, 2024. 
 
 On August 8, 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement {the "Underwriting Agreement") with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and William Blair Company, L.L.C., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (collectively, the "Underwriters"), in connection with the August offering. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, we also granted the Underwriters an option exercisable for 30 days to purchase up to an additional 1,384,615 shares of our common stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions, which the Underwriters exercised in full on August 9, 2024 . The August 2024 Offering closed on August 12, 2024. Total shares issued were 10,615,385. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately 64.5 m illion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering to support the commercial launch activities for MIPLYFFA, continued commercial support for OLPRUVA and the continued development of celiprolol and KP1077 through potential NDA filings and other general corporate purposes. 
 
 We have incurred operating losses since our inception and, as of September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit o f 469.6 m illion. Our recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue operating as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to generate revenue from approved products or obtain product candidate regulatory approvals, which would generate revenue, milestones, and cash flow sufficient to support ongoing operations and the satisfaction of financial covenants. We are early in our commercialization effort for OLPRUVA and MIPLYFFA and do not yet have a substantial basis to project future earnings, and our other sources of revenue are not sufficient to sustain our present activities on their own. Accordingly, our ability to continue as a going concern may require us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations. The perception of our inability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, suppliers and employees. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt, the terms of these securities may restrict our ability to operate. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or altogether cease our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.

Equity Distribution Agreements 
 
 On July 12, 2024, we entered into an equity distribution agreement (the "2024 ATM Agreement") with Citizens JMP Securities LLC ("Citizens JMP") under which we may offer and sell, from time to time in our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 75.0 million through Citizens JMP as our sales agent. The issuance and sale, if any, of common stock by us under the 2024 ATM Agreement will be made pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. Citizens JMP may sell the common stock by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. Citizens JMP will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the common stock from time to time, based upon instructions from us (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose). We will pay Citizens JMP a commission equal to 3.0 in the aggregate of the gross sales proceeds of any common stock sold through Citizens JMP under the 2024 ATM Agreement. In connection with the 2024 ATM Agreement, we filed the June 2024 Registration Statement, the accompanying prospectus, and the related prospectus supplement dated July 12, 2024, covering the sale of the shares of our common stock up to 350.0 million, 75.0 million of which was allocated to the sales of the shares of common stock issuable under the 2024 ATM Agreement. 
 
 On July 2, 2021, we entered into an equity distribution agreement ("2021 ATM Agreement") with JMP Securities LLC ("JMP") and RBC Capital Markets, LLC ("RBCCM"), under which we had the ability to offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 75.0 million through JMP and RBCCM as our sales agents. The 2021 ATM Agreement expired on July 12, 2024. 
 
 Merger Transactions and Documents 
 
 On August 30, 2023, in connection with the Merger Agreement with Acer, the following transactions occurred prior to Closing: 

Bridge Loan Zevra and Acer entered into a bridge loan facility for up to 18.0 million ("Bridge Loan"), providing for Zevra to make the Bridge Loan to Acer up to an aggregate principal amount of 16.5 million. The Bridge Loan was provided to Acer to support its termination agreement with Relief and to provide Acer with working capital, including for payments of accounts payable to support the commercial launch of OLPRUVA and the development of celiprolol pending the Merger s closure. On October 31, 2023, the Company and Acer entered into an amendment to the Bridge Loan Agreement, which increased the aggregate principal amount available under the loan from 16.5 million to 18.0 million. 

Purchase of Acer s Term Loans Zevra purchased certain indebtedness of Acer held by Nantahala Capital Management, LLC ("NCM"). Under the loan purchase with Nantahala, certain of its affiliates and certain other parties (collectively with Nantahala, Nantahala Holders Zevra purchased (i) an original senior secured term loan facility made available to Acer in an aggregate amount of 6.5 million and funded on March 14, 2022, and (ii) an additional senior secured term loan made to Acer in an aggregate amount of 7.0 million in a single borrowing which funded on January 31, 2023 for (1) 12.0 million in cash (2) 98,683 shares of Zevra Common Stock and (3) a secured Promissory Note payable by Zevra to Nantahala in the original principal amount 5.0 million (the Nantahala Note ). These were recorded as receivables from Acer and were treated as a settlement of a preexisting relationship in connection with the closing of the transaction and recorded as a component of purchase consideration. In April 2024, the Nantahala Note was repaid in full and terminated. 

Purchase of Acer s Convertible Notes Marathon Convertible Notes Under the Note Purchase Agreement with the Nantahala Holders, Zevra purchased the Marathon Convertible Notes that Nantahala had acquired on June 16, 2023. Zevra acquired the Marathon Convertible Notes in exchange for the issuance of 2,171,038 shares of Zevra Common Stock at 5.0667 per share for a total purchase price of 11.0 million. 

Amendment to IP License Agreement and IP Termination Agreement: As a condition to entering into the Merger Agreement, Acer and Relief entered into the Exclusive License Agreement and the Termination Agreement terminating the collaboration and license agreement, dated March 19, 2021, by and between Acer and Relief. Pursuant to the Exclusive License Agreement, Relief holds exclusive development and commercialization rights for OLPRUVA in Geographical Europe. Acer has the right to receive a royalty of up to 10 of the net sales of OLPRUVA in Geographical Europe. In accordance with the terms of the Termination Agreement, Relief received an upfront payment from Acer of 10.0 million (which payment was funded with the Bridge Loan described above) with an additional payment of 1.5 million due on the first-year anniversary of the 10.0 million payment. Acer has also agreed to pay a 10 royalty on net sales of OLPRUVA worldwide, excluding Geographical Europe, and 20.0 of any value received by Acer from certain third parties relating to OLPRUVA licensing or divestment rights, all of the foregoing which are capped at 45.0 million, for total payments to Relief of up to 56.5 million. 

In connection with the closing of the Merger on November 17, 2023, each share of common stock of Acer was converted into the right to receive (i) 0.1210 fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of Zevra, par value 0.0001 per share, and (ii) one non-transferable CVR to be issued by Zevra, which will represent the right to receive one or more contingent payments up to an additional 76 million upon the achievement, if any, of certain commercial and regulatory milestones for Acer s OLPRUVA and celiprolol products within specified time periods. Certain additional cash payments are also possible pursuant to the CVRs with respect to milestones involving Acer s early-stage program ACER-2820 (emetine).

Registration Rights Agreement 
 
 Zevra and Nantahala concurrently entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement ), pursuant to which Zevra agreed to file a resale registration statement with respect to the resale of the Zevra common stock issuable under the Loan and Note Purchase Agreements and the Nantahala Note. On February 5, 2024, Zevra filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-276856) registering an aggregate of 2,269,721 shares of Zevra s common stock that were issued pursuant to the Loan and Note Purchase Agreements. On April 5, 2024, we filed an amendment to the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-250945) covering the issuance of the shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants issued in connection with the Merger and remaining unexercised as of the date of the amendment, which was declared effective on April 8, 2024. 
 
 Cancellation of Acer Warrant 
 
 On November 22, 2023, we sold an aggregate of 1,382,489 shares of our common stock and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 1,382,489 shares of our common stock at a price of 4.34 per share to a healthcare focused investment fund (the Investor for gross proceeds of approximately 6.0 million and an aggregate of 917,934 shares of our common stock to cancel a warrant held by the Investor to purchase 2,920,306 shares of common stock of Acer. The shares of common stock and warrants were offered and sold to the Investor in a registered direct offering without an underwriter or placement agent. 
 
 Line of Credit 
 
 On January 26, 2023, we and Wells Fargo, as lender, entered into a margin account agreement. Our investments were used as collateral for the loan and the amount we were able to borrow was limited to 80-90 of our outstanding investment balance held with Wells Fargo. The margin account bore interest at the Prime Rate minus 225 basis-points. This facility was paid off on April 5, 2024, and the margin capability was removed from the account. 
 
 Term Loans 

On April 5, 2024 (the "Term Loans Closing Date"), we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with HCR Stafford Fund II, L.P., HCR Potomac Fund II, L.P., and Perceptive Credit Holdings IV, LP (collectively, the Lenders ), and Alter Domus (US) LLC, as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent ).

Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Lenders provided a senior secured loan facility to us in the aggregate principal amount of 100.0 million, which is divided into three tranches as follows: (i) 60.0 million which was funded in full on the Term Loans Closing Date; (ii) 20.0 million which is available to us in up to two drawings, each in an amount not to exceed 10.0 million, at the Company s option until 18 months following the Term Loans Closing Date; and (iii) 20.0 million which is available to us upon approval by the FDA of the NDA for MIPLYFFA for the treatment of NPC, at our option until December 31, 2024 (collectively, the Term Loans ). 

The principal amount of the Term Loans outstanding (the Outstanding Principal Amount will bear interest at a rate equal to 3-Month Term SOFR
 plus 7.00 per annum. If the net product sales for the calendar year ending December 31, 2025, exceed 100.0 million, the Outstanding Principal Amount will bear interest at 3-Month Term SOFR
 plus 6.00 per annum. If the net product sales for the calendar year ending December 31, 2025, do not exceed 100.0 million, then for any subsequent period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or after March 31, 2026, in which net product sales exceed 125.0 million, the Outstanding Principal Amount will bear interest at 3-Month Term SOFR
 plus 6.50 per annum. In all cases, the 3-Month Term SOFR rate will be subject to a floor of 4.00 per annum. Interest will be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter. We have the option to pay up to 25 of the interest in-kind beginning on the Term Loans Closing Date, through and including June 30, 2026. The Term Loans will mature on the fifth anniversary of the Term Loans Closing Date. In connection with the Credit Agreement, we incurred approximately 2.
 2 million of costs, which primarily consisted of underwriting, legal and other professional fees, and are included as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related debt liability and are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the financing using the effective interest method.

The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants by us, which among other things, will require us to provide certain financial reports to the Lenders, meet certain minimum net product sales amounts, and limit our ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, engage in certain transactions, and effect a consolidation or merger without consent. In addition, as long as the line of credit remains active, we must maintain a minimum cash balance of 20.0 million to ensure that we can meet our immediate capital needs. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon customary events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest, fees and other amounts, covenant defaults, insolvency, material judgments, or inaccuracy of representations and warranties. The Term Loans are secured by a first priority perfected lien on, and security interest in, substantially all of our current and future assets. The proceeds of the Term Loans were used to refinance certain of our previously existing indebtedness. We will use the remaining proceeds to pay fees and expenses related to the debt financing and fund the development and commercialization of OLPRUVA and MIPLYFFA.

Future Funding Requirements 
 
 While under applicable accou nting principles factors exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, based on our current operating forecast and the net proceeds from the August 2024 Offering (as described above), we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2027, su bject to continuing compliance with our debt covenants. This estimate includes anticipated revenue from MIPLYFFA sales, reimbursements from the EAP, royalties under the AZSTARYS License Agreement, and accounts for continued investments into our development pipeline programs. This estimate does not include potential proceeds from a PRV sale. Certain of the milestones are associated with regulatory matters that are outside our control. In addition, we maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the event of a failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our business and financial position. 
 
 Potential near-term sources of additional funding include: 

any royalties or net sales milestone payments generated under the AZSTARYS License Agreement; 

any product sales under the EAP; 

any product sales of OLPRUVA; 

any product sales of MIPLYFFA; and 

any consulting services revenue generated under other potential consulting agreements; 

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient proceeds from any of these potential sources to fund our operating expenses. We anticipate that our expenses will fluctuate substantially as we: 

continue our ongo ing cli nical trials and our product development activities for our pipeline of product candidates; 

seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

continue research and development and clinical trials of our product candidates; 

seek to discover and develop additional product candidates either internally or in partnership with other pharmaceutical companies; 

adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products; 

maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and 

incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company. 

To date, we have generated revenue from the AZSTARYS License Agreement, reimbursements of out-of-pocket third-party costs, the performance of consulting services, OLPRUVA product sales, and product sales under the EAP. We expect that, for the foreseeable future, our only sources of revenues will be through payments arising from the AZSTARYS License Agreement, product sales of OLPRUVA and MIPLYFFA, through potential consulting arrangements and any other future arrangements related to one of our product candidates and product sales under the EAP. While we have entered into the AZSTARYS License Agreement to develop, manufacture and commercialize AZSTARYS, we cannot guarantee that this, or any strategy we adopt in the future, will be successful. For instance, we received milestone payments under the AZSTARYS License Agreement, but we cannot guarantee that we will earn any additional milestone or royalty payments under this agreement in the future. We also cannot guarantee that we will continue to generate revenue under the EAP or successfully commercialize OLPRUVA or MILYFFA. We also expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.

Table of Contents 

We have based our estimates of our cash needs and cash runway on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient proceeds from the AZSTARYS License Agreement, product reimbursements under the EAP, product sales of OLPRUVA and MILYFFA, potential consulting arrangements or other funding transactions to fund our operating expenses. To meet any additional cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible securities that may result in dilution to our stockholders, issue additional debt or seek other third-party funding, including potential strategic transactions, such as licensing or collaboration arrangements. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of product candidates and products, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the commercialization and development of our partnered product or product candidates, should they obtain regulatory approval. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 This management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Our critical accounting policies have not changed materially from those described in Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal y ear ended December 31, 2023 , filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 . Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 , our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
 OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
 Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may be involved in routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, which arise in the normal course of our business. In connection with the AZSTARYS License Agreement with Commave, a dispute has arisen with Commave concerning the interpretation of certain provisions under the AZSTARYS License Agreement. On September 4, 2024, Commave filed a complaint against Zevra in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (Case No. 2024-0920-LWW) alleging breach of contract and seeking injunctive relief, specific performance, declaratory relief, and damages regarding the parties' respective rights and obligations under the Agreement. 
 
 We strongly disagree with Commave's allegations and believe this lawsuit is without merit. We filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on October 7, 2024. Commave s opposition to the motion to dismiss is due November 21, 2024, and Zevra s reply in support of the motion to dismiss is due December 20, 2024. All discovery in the litigation has been stayed pending resolution of Zevra s motion to dismiss. 
 
 The litigation is in its early stages. While we intend to vigorously defend against Commave's claims, the outcome of this matter is inherently uncertain. We cannot predict with certainty the timing or ultimate outcome of this litigation or its potential impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. At this time, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with this matter. 
 
 The AZSTARYS License Agreement remains in effect during this litigation, and both parties continue to perform their respective obligations thereunder. However, there can be no assurance that this dispute will not have an adverse impact on our relationship with Commave or on Zevra s business. 
 
 We will continue to monitor developments in this matter and will assess the potential impact on our financial statements in future periods. We expect to incur significant legal expenses in connection with this litigation, which may materially affect our results of operations in future periods. 
 
 Other than disclosed herein, we believe there is no litigation pending that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 

Item 1A. 
 Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider all the risk factors and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, before investing in our common stock. Other than as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in that report. If any of those risks materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements because of the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and below, and the other factors described in in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 I f we experience additional material weaknesses or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or report them in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock. 
 
 Our management is required to report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We previously identified and disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This material weakness has since been remediated. 
 
 Our failure to certify the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures, or the identification of the material weakness, could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price. In the future, we may identify additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, and we may not be able to remediate them in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and, if and when such a report is required, receiving a favorable attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm. If we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our common stock price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
