units (the Units 
and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ). Each Unit
consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value per share (the Class A Common Stock ), and
one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (a Warrant ), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to
purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for per share. The Units were sold at a price of per Unit, generating gross
proceeds to the Company of . 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the sale of shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock (the Private
Shares at a price of per Private Share in a private placement to the Company s sponsor, Water by Nordic AB (the
 Sponsor ), byNordic Holdings LLC byNordic Holdings and byNordic Holdings II LLC byNordic Holdings
II ). Both byNordic Holdings and byNordic Holdings II are affiliates of the Sponsor. 

The
Company granted the underwriters a -day option to purchase up to additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the
IPO price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On February 18, 2022, the underwriters fully exercised their over-allotment
option by purchasing an additional Units, consisting of shares of Class A Common Stock and redeemable warrants
generating additional gross proceeds of to the Company and bringing the total gross proceeds of the IPO to .
In connection with the exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option in full, the Company completed the sale of an additional
 Private Shares to the Sponsor, byNordic Holdings and byNordic Holdings II at a price of per Private Share in a private
placement. 

Following
the closing of the IPO on February 11, 2022 and the exercise of the over-allotment option, an amount of per Unit)
from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Shares was placed in a trust account Trust
Account ). The proceeds in the Trust Account were invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section
2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, through an open-ended investment company that holds itself
out as a money market fund meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until
the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s
stockholders, as described below. 

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale
of the Private Shares, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business
Combination. The Company must complete its Business Combination with one or more target companies having an aggregate fair market value
of at least of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest
earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into a Business Combination. The Company anticipates structuring its
Business Combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which the holders of Public Shares will
own or acquire of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company
owns or acquires less than of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target
management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company
owns or acquires or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest
in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the voting securities of the target, the Company s
stockholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending
on valuations ascribed to the target and the Company in the Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be
able to successfully effect a Business Combination.

per Public Share, plus a pro rata share of any additional deposits made to the Trust Account in connection with extensions of the period
of time the Company has to complete a Business Combination and any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and
not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to public stockholders who
redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as
discussed in Note 6). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s
warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption are recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion
of the IPO in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity. 

The
Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company seeks stockholder approval and a majority of the shares voted are voted
in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder
vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.
If, however, stockholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business
or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not
pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s
Sponsor, byNordic Holdings, byNordic Holdings II, officers and directors and certain Anchor Investors (as defined herein) that purchased
Founder Shares in connection with the IPO (see Note 6) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) in favor of approving
a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote
for or against the proposed transaction. 

Notwithstanding
the above, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender
offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of
such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section
13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares
with respect to more than an aggregate of or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

Each
of the Sponsor, byNordic Holdings, byNordic Holdings II, and officers and directors of the Company that hold Founder Shares have agreed
(a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion
of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify
the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company s Business Combination
or to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision
relating to stockholders rights or pre-Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with
the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. Anchor Investors in the Company s IPO have
agreed that they have no claims to any funds in the Trust Account or other assets of the Company with respect to the Founder Shares they
purchased. 

The
Company had 15 months from the closing of the IPO to complete a Business Combination as such deadline may be extended for an additional
three month period for a total of up to 18 months to complete a Business Combination if the Company s Sponsor or any of its affiliates
or designees, upon five business days advance notice prior to the date of the deadline for completing the Company s Business
Combination, paid an additional per public share into the Trust Account in respect of such extension period on or prior to the
date of the deadline (in connection with which the Company s stockholders had no right to redeem their Public Shares), or by such
other further extended deadline that the Company may have to consummate a Business Combination beyond 18 months as a result of a stockholder
vote to amend the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (in connection with which the Company s stockholders
will have a right to redeem their Public Shares) (the Combination Period ). 

On
May 8, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors elected to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business
Combination from May 11, 2023 to August 11, 2023 (the Initial Extension and the Company s Sponsor subsequently deposited
 to the Trust Account with respect to the Initial Extension.

of net tangible assets following
the redemption of Public Shares in connection with a Business Combination, and (ii) to extend the Combination Period from August 11,
2023 to February 12, 2024, or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors, in its sole discretion, and
to allow the Company by resolution of the board without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Combination Period by one additional
month, for a total of six additional months, until August 12, 2024, unless the closing of a Business Combination shall have occurred
prior thereto. In connection with the amendments to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company notified stockholders
that the Company s Sponsor funded a deposit of into the Trust Account and that the Company would only exercise any monthly
extension after February 12, 2024 if the Sponsor or one of its affiliates or designees deposits into the Trust Account the lesser of
 or per outstanding Public Share with respect to each such extension. 

In
connection with the August 2023 amendments to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, of the
Public Shares were redeemed at a redemption price of approximately per share, or in the aggregate, and approximately
 remained in the Trust Account following such redemptions. 

Along with the redemptions of the Company s
Public Shares, the Company recorded a excise tax liability of on the balance sheet as of the redemption date. The liability
does not impact the condensed statements of operations and offsets against additional paid-in capital or accumulated deficit if additional
paid-in capital is not available. 

At
an annual meeting on August 7, 2024, the stockholders of the Company approved amendments (the August 2024 Amendments to
the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to permit the Board to extend the Combination Period by one month
each time from August 12, 2024 to August 12, 2025, or such earlier date as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by depositing
 for each such monthly extension to the Trust Account, unless the closing of a Business Combination shall have occurred prior
thereto. In connection with the August 2024 amendments to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 
of the Public Shares were tendered for redemption for or approximately per share. 

Along
with the redemptions of the Company s Public Shares, the Company recorded a excise tax liability of approximately on
the balance sheet as of the redemption date. The liability does not impact the condensed statements of operations and offsets against
additional paid-in capital or accumulated deficit if additional paid-in capital is not available. 

Further
in connection with the annual meeting, the stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the Company s Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to provide for the right of a stockholder of the Company s Class B common stock, par value 
per share, to convert into shares of the Company s Class A common stock, par value per share on a one-for-one basis at
any time, and from time to time, prior to the closing of a Business Combination at the election of the holder. 

Following
the August 10, 2024 special meeting, the Sponsor, byNordic Holdings and byNordic Holdings II converted an aggregate of of
their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis (the Conversion ).
Such converted shares of Class A common stock are not entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account through redemptions or otherwise
and will remain subject to the existing transfer restrictions. After giving effect to the redemptions in August 2024 and the Conversion,
the Company had shares of Class A common stock (including converted shares of Class B common
stock) and shares of Class B common stock outstanding.

(the Additional Extension
Loan in connection with the Sponsor s funding of an extension deposit to the Trust Account and a convertible promissory
note in the principal amount of (the Additional Working Capital Loan to provide the Company with additional working
capital, of which was funded on August 10, 2023 and is available for future borrowings. 

In
December 2023, the Company issued a promissory note in the principal amount of (the December 2023 Note to DDM
Debt AB (the DDM ), an affiliate of the Sponsor. The proceeds of the borrowing under the December 2023 Note were used to
provide the Company with general working capital. 

The
Company obtained additional loans from DDM in the amount of and , respectively, pursuant to promissory notes issued
in April 2024 (the April 2024 Note and June 2024 (the June 2024 Note ). (See Note 5). 

In
August and September 2024, the Company issued promissory notes in the principal amount of (the August 2024 Note and (the September 2024 Note ), respectively, to DDM. The proceeds of the borrowings under the August 2024 Note
and September 2024 Note will be used to provide the Company with general working capital. The notes are not convertible into securities
of the Company and are due upon the consummation of a Business Combination. 

Together,
the Initial Extension Loan, the Initial Working Capital Loan, the Additional Extension Loan, the Additional Working Capital Loan are
sometimes referred to herein, collectively, as the Convertible Promissory Notes. The December 2023 Note, the April 2024
Note, the June 2024 Note, the August 2024 Note, and the September 2024 Note are sometimes referred to herein, collectively, as the Non-convertible
Promissory Notes. 

Neither
the Convertible Promissory Notes or the Non-convertible Promissory Notes bear interest and are due upon consummation of a Business Combination.
If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would expect to repay the Convertible Promissory Notes and the Non-convertible
Promissory Notes from funds that are released to the Company from the Trust Account. At the option of the holder of the Convertible Promissory
Notes, the holder has the option to convert all or a portion of the Convertible Promissory Notes into Private Shares at a price of 
per Private Share, which Private Shares will be identical to the Private Shares described herein (Note 5). 

If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except
for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public
Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest
earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to 
of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject
to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s
remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s
obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

The
Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination
within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor or any of its respective affiliates acquire Public Shares after the IPO, such
Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination
within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note
6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and, in
such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption
of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for
distribution will be less than the redemption price per Public Share (following the Company s Initial Extension). 

In
order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims
by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed
entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share
following the exercise of the Company s Initial Extension) and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account
as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per share, due to reductions in the value of the Trust Account
assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business
who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will

Risks
and Uncertainties 

Geopolitical
events, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine , the Israel-Hamas war and increased hostilities in the Middle East, have had a material
adverse effect on financial and business conditions in Europe in a manner that could materially and adversely affect the business and
prospects of potential targets for our initial Business Combination. These circumstances could reduce the number of attractive targets
for our initial business combination, increase the cost of our initial Business Combination and delay or prevent us from completing our
initial Business Combination. 

On
February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation launched an invasion of Ukraine, and on October 7, 2023, Israel declared war against Hamas.
These conflicts have continued to escalate without any resolution foreseeable in the near future with the short and long-term impact
on financial and business conditions in Europe remaining highly uncertain. As a result of the invasion of Ukraine, the United States,
the European Union, Canada and other countries have imposed sanctions against the Russian Federation contributing to higher inflation
and disruptions to supply and distribution chains. The impact of the sanctions also includes disruptions to financial markets, an inability
to complete financial or banking transactions, restrictions on travel and an inability to service existing or new customers in a timely
manner in the affected areas of Europe. Many multinational corporations have exceeded what is required by the newer and stricter sanctions
in reducing or terminating their business ties to the Russian Federation. The Russian Federation could resort to cyberattacks and other
action that impact businesses across Europe including those without any direct business ties to the Russian Federation. The continuing
geopolitical uncertainty relating to the Israel-Hamas war, other conflicts in the Middle East, terrorist attacks or other hostile acts,
civil unrest, including demonstrations and protests, regionally, in Europe or the United States, could cause further damage or disruption
to international commerce and the global economy, and thus have a material adverse effect on the business, the cost and availability
of capital and prospects of technology companies in northern Europe which are the focus of the Company s search for a Business
Combination. The number of attractive targets for the Company s Business Combination could be reduced, the cost of a Business Combination
may be increased, and the Company could experience a delay of, or inability to complete a Business Combination. The condensed financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and
certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023 (the Excise Tax ).
The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount
of the Excise Tax is generally of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes
of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against
the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the Excise Tax. 

The
U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and
prevent the abuse or avoidance of, the excise tax; however, only limited guidance has been issued to date. On December 27, 2022,
the Treasury published Notice 2023-2 as interim guidance until the publication of forthcoming proposed regulations on the excise
tax. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether, and/or to what extent, the excise tax could apply to redemptions of the Company s
Class A Common Stock, including any redemptions in connection with a Business Combination, or in the event the Company does not consummate
a Business Combination. 

Whether
and to what extent the Company would be subject to the Excise Tax will depend on a number of factors, including (i) whether the
redemption is treated as a repurchase of stock for purposes of the Excise Tax, (ii) the fair market value of the redemptions treated
as repurchases in connection with a Business Combination, (iii) the structure of a Business Combination and whether any such transaction
closes, (iv) the nature and amount of any private investment in public equity PIPE or other equity issuances in
connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same
taxable year of a Business Combination), (v) whether we consummate a Business Combination, and (vi) the content of regulations and
other guidance issued by the Treasury. It is possible that the Company will be subject to the Excise Tax with respect to any subsequent
redemptions, including redemptions in connection with the Business Combination, that are treated as repurchases for this purpose (other
than, pursuant to recently issued guidance from the Treasury, redemptions in complete liquidation of the Company). As mentioned, the
Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not the stockholders from which stock is repurchased. The imposition of
the Excise Tax (including as a result of public stockholders electing to exercise their redemption rights in connection with an Business
Combination) could, however, reduce the amount of cash available to the Company to pay redemptions (or the cash contribution to the target
business in connection with our Business Combination, which could hinder the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination
or cause the other stockholders of the combined company to economically bear the impact of such Excise Tax). 

During
the second quarter, the IRS issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the excise tax. Pursuant to those regulations,
the Company would need to file a return and remit payment for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023 to December
31, 2023 on or before October 31, 2024. 

In
October 2024, the Company filed its excise tax return and paid arising from the redemption of Public Shares in August 2023. 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of not held in the Trust Account and a working capital deficit of . 

The
Company has entered into the Convertible Promissory Notes and Non-convertible Promissory Notes and as of September 30, 2024 borrowed
 to be used to extend the Combination Period to December 12, 2024 and for general working capital purposes (Note 5). 

Under the Company s Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors of the Company has the ability to extend the Business Combination period on a monthly
basis through August 12, 2025 by causing to be deposited to the Company s trust account with respect to each such extension.
The Company currently has until December 12, 2024 or the end of any further extension period to consummate a Business Combination. Any
extension beyond August 12, 2025 would require an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by December 12, 2024 or such later date to which the
Business Combination period may be extended. If a Business Combination is not consummated by December 12, 2024 or during any further extension
period, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution.

will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing
of the IPO. The warrants will expire after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The
Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation
to issue any shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act
with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current,
subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable, and the Company will
not be obligated to issue any shares of Class A Common Stock upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A Common Stock issuable upon such
warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered
holder of the warrants. 

The
Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 days, after the closing of a Business Combination, it will
use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Class
A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and thereafter will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the same to become
effective within 60 business days following the Business Combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class A Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement.
If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the
60 th business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective
registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise
warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. If that exemption,
or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. 

Once
the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the warrants: 

in whole and not in part; at a price of per warrant; upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Company s Class A common stock equals or exceeds per share for any trading days within a -trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to each warrant holder. 

If
the Company calls the warrants for redemption for cash, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise
the warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares
of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock
dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be
adjusted for issuance of Class A Common Stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required
to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company
liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants,
nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants.
Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We are not presently engaged
in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our business combination. We intend to effectuate our business combination
using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering, the private placement of the private shares, the private placement of the
forward purchase shares, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our business combination (pursuant to forward purchase
agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the closing of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued
to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We
have not selected any specific business combination target. 

The
issuance of additional shares in connection with a business combination to the owners of the target or other investors, including the
forward purchase shares: 

may
 significantly dilute the equity interest of our public stockholders, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions
 in the Class B common stock resulted in the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion
 of the Class B common stock; 

may
 subordinate the rights of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common
 stock; 

could
 cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things,
 our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers
 and directors; 

may
 have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person
 seeking to obtain control of us; and 

may
 adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock and/or warrants. 

22 

Similarly,
if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt to bank or other lenders or the owners of a target, it could result in: 

default
 and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 

acceleration
 of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants
 that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our
 immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 

our
 inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such
 financing while the debt security is outstanding; 

our
 inability to pay dividends on our common stock; 

using
 a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends
 on our common stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general
 corporate purposes; 

limitations
 on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased
 vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; 

limitations
 on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution
 of our strategy; and 

other
 disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from December 27, 2019 (inception) through
September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying
a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business
Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur
expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due
diligence expenses. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 206,146 which consisted of operating costs of 491,087 and federal income

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 1,934,857 not held in the Trust Account and a working capital deficit of 6,321,939. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 1,099,776. Net loss of 31,965 was affected by interest
earned on investments in the Trust Account of 1,528,554 and unrealized losses on investments in the Trust Account of 128,443. Changes
in operating assets and liabilities provided 332,300 of cash for operating activities. Cash provided by investing activities was 29,219,320
including 438,522 withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay taxes, 29,491,422 cash withdrawn from trust account in connection with redemption
partially offset by 710,624 of deposits to the Trust Account. Cash used in financing activities includes 1,000,000 of proceeds from
the promissory notes to related party partially offset by 29,491,422 redemption of common stock. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
cash used in operating activities was 2,827,468. Net income of 3,155,803 was affected by interest earned on cash and investments in
the Trust Account of 6,059,910 and unrealized loss on investments in the Trust Account of 436,910. Changes in operating assets and liabilities
used 360,271 of cash for operating activities. Cash provided by investing activities includes 145,584,637 withdrawn in connection
with redemption and 1,929,800 withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay taxes partially offset by 2,350,000 of funding for the Trust Account.
Cash used in financing activities includes 145,584,637 of redemption of common stock partially offset by 3,235,000 of proceeds from
promissory notes to related party. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 11,697,428 consisting of money market funds which are
invested primarily in U.S. Treasury securities. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have withdrawn 438,522 of interest earned on the Trust Account for the payment of franchise
and income taxes. 

We
intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust
Account (less taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or
in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 1,934,857 not held in the Trust Account and available for working capital purposes. 

26 

The
Company has entered into the Convertible Promissory Notes and Non-convertible Promissory Notes and as of September 30, 2024 borrowed
 5,935,000 to be used to extend the Combination Period to December 12, 2024 and for general working capital purposes. 

The
Company has until December 12, 2024 or the end of any further extension period to consummate a Business Combination beyond December 12,
2024 pursuant to an amendment of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. It is uncertain that the Company will be able
to consummate a Business Combination by December 12, 2024 or such later date to which the business combination period may be extended.
If a Business Combination is not consummated by December 12, 2024 if the Company elects to extend the Business Combination period and
makes required deposits to the Trust Account) or during any further extension period, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent
dissolution. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s
Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern, management has determined that (i) uncertainty with respect to the Company s ability to obtain the cash
needed to fund professional fees and other expenses related to its target search activities, SEC reports, tax returns, Nasdaq listing,
trust and stock transfer administration and other business and corporate activities, and trust deposits required for further extensions
to the Combination Period, and (ii) the mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution, should the Company be unable to complete a
Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate
after December 12, 2024 or at the end of any further extension period. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do
not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as
variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have
not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments
of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement
pay the Sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for administrative support services and outstanding promissory notes to the Sponsor and
its affiliates in the aggregate amount of 5,935,000 as of September 30, 2024. We began incurring the administrative support services
fees on February 8, 2022 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination
and our liquidation. 

The
underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting discount of 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO and exercise of the over-allotment
option, or 6,037,500, upon the completion of the Company s business combination. The Company s former legal counsel agreed
to defer legal fees in the amount of 175,000, which is payable (without interest) upon and concurrently with the completion of a business
combination. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

We
describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements
included in this report. Our audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our accounting
policies require that the Company s management apply significant judgments in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to
financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company s management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and
judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgments are based on historical
experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by
their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and, therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In
February 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on
the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the
period covered by this Report due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s
accounting for certain deferred contingent transaction costs. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure
that the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Management has implemented remediation steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically,
we expanded and improved our review process for accrued, deferred or contingent expenses and related accounting standards. We plan to
further improve this process by enhancing access to accounting literature, identifying third-party professionals with whom to consult
on complex questions regarding accounting for accrued, deferred or contingent expenses, and improving the processes for sharing, approving
and evaluating contractual arrangements and invoices related to accrued, deferred or contingent expenses. We believe that the actions
described above will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weakness and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than as described above and elsewhere in this Report, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
