stated value even though, per the Company s Articles of Incorporation, the common stock has no par value. Additionally, components of equity that should have been reflected within common stock were improperly reported within retained earnings. We have reviewed historical activity reflected in common stock and retained earnings and have identified adjustments to be made to correct the immaterial reporting error. The consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of stockholders equity have been corrected and have been updated for prior years within this Form 10-Q. 

We assessed the materiality of this error on prior periods' financial statements in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality , codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 250, Presentation of Financial Statements . We concluded that the error was not material to any prior annual or interim period and therefore, amendments of previously filed reports are not required. In accordance with ASC 250, we have corrected the reporting for all prior periods presented by revising the consolidated financial statements appearing herein. Periods not presented herein will be revised, as applicable, in future filings. The revisions had no impact on total assets, total liabilities, total shareholders' equity, net income or the cash flow statement. 

The impact of this revision on our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of stockholders equity as of September 30, 2023 was as follows: 

Retained Earnings 

Total Stockholders Equity 

Assets Held For Sale 

 We classify assets as held for sale when our management approves and commits to a formal plan of sale that is probable of being completed within one (1) year. Assets designated as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their current carrying value or their fair market value, less costs to sell, beginning in the period in which the assets meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Mexico facility for million. The Company received cash proceeds of million, with the remaining million deposited in an escrow account. The Company recognized a gain of million, included in operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The restricted stock units awarded to directors time vest over two years one -half one year from grant date and one -half two years from grant date) provided that the director is still a director of the Company at the vest date. Director restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture, except for termination of services as a result of retirement, death or disability, if on the vesting date the director no longer holds a position with the Company. The 2024 restricted stock units awarded to employees time vest over three years one -third one year from grant, one -third two years from grant and one -third three years from grant) provided that the employee continues to serve as an employee, director or consultant of the Company on the vesting date. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized stock based compensation expense of thousand and thousand, respectively, compared to stock based compensation expense of thousand and thousand for the same periods in the prior year. At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, there was thousand and thousand in unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock awards. The unrecognized compensation expense of unvested restricted stock awards not yet recognized as of September 30, 2024 is expected to be recognized over the weighted average period of years.

Gross-to-net sales adjustments We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the statement of operations. These adjustments are referred to as gross-to-net sales adjustments and primarily fall into one of three categories: returns, warranties and customer allowances. 

Returns The Company records an accrued liability and reduction in sales for estimated product returns based upon historical experience. An accrued liability and reduction in sales is also recorded for approved return authorizations that have been communicated by the customer. 

Warranties Limited warranties are provided on certain products for varying periods. We record an accrued liability and reduction in sales for estimated future warranty claims based upon historical experience and management s estimate of the level of future claims. Changes in the estimated amounts recognized in prior years are recorded as an adjustment to the accrued liability and sales in the current year. The accrued liability amount attributable to warranties was thousand as of September 30, 2024. There were no changes to the accrual due to a change in estimate during the current period. 

Customer Allowances Customer allowances are common practice in the industries in which the Company operates. These agreements are typically in the form of advertising subsidies, volume rebates and catalog allowances and are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales. The Company reviews such allowances on an ongoing basis and accruals are adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available. 

Contract Balances Amounts relating to returns and customer allowances create contract liabilities, which were thousand, thousand and thousand as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. 

Disaggregation of Revenue We generate revenue from the sale of widely recognized sporting goods brands in basketball goals, archery, indoor and outdoor game recreation and fitness products. These products are sold through multiple sales channels that include: mass merchants, specialty dealers, key on-line retailers E-commerce and international.

year to years. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not entered into any lease arrangements classified as a finance lease. 

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets, current operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The Company has elected an accounting policy to not recognize short-term leases (one year or less) on the balance sheet. The Company also elected the package of practical expedients which applies to leases that commenced before the adoption date. By electing the package of practical expedients, the Company did not need to reassess the following; whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for any existing leases and initial direct costs for any existing leases. 

ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. When the implicit rate of the lease is not provided or cannot be determined, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of future payments. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease and recognized in the presentation of the ROU assets and operating lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Components of lease expense and other information is as follows:

million (the Revolving Facility ), up from million, plus an accordion feature that would allow borrowings up to million under the Revolving Facility subject to certain terms and conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility was extended to January 21, 2027. The Company may prepay the Revolving Facility, in whole or in part, and reborrow prior to the revolving loan maturity date. The Restated Credit Agreement further extended the maturity date for the term loan facility to January 21, 2027. 

On July 18, 2022, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Restated Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the First Amendment, the Lender increased the maximum availability under the senior revolving credit facility from million to million pursuant to the accordion feature in the Restated Credit Agreement. The First Amendment also adjusted the funded debt to EBITDA ratio financial covenant to 3:00 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2022. 

On October 26, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment ("Second Amendment to the Restated Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Second Amendment, the Lender increased the maximum availability under the senior revolving credit facility from million to million pursuant to the accordion feature in the Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment adjusted the funded debt to EBITDA ratio financial covenant to 3:25 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2022 and 3:00 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Second Amendment also modified the EBITDA definition to permit add-backs of a) up to million for disposition related expenses; and b) up to million for unusual or non-recurring expenses which are incurred prior to the end of fiscal year 2023 and which are subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent. 

On May 8, 2023, the Company entered into the Third Amendment (the Third Amendment to the Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment adjusted the funded debt to EBITDA ratio financial covenant to 4:25 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s second fiscal quarter of 2023, 3:00 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s third fiscal quarter of 2023, and 2:75 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 and thereafter. The Third Amendment adjusted the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant to 1:10 to 1:00 commencing as of the Company s fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 and 1:25 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s first fiscal quarter of 2024 and thereafter. For the Company s second and third fiscal quarters in 2023, the Third Amendment suspended the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and added a minimum EBITDA covenant of million as of the end of each such fiscal quarter. Under the terms of the Third Amendment, the Company and the Lender also agreed to decrease the maximum availability under the senior revolving credit facility from million to million, upon the consummation of the sale of the Company s Mexican subsidiary and the dissolution of Escalade Insurance, Inc. The proceeds from such sale and dissolution, respectively, will be used to partially prepay the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As reflected in the Fourth Amendment to the Restated Credit Agreement effective September 1, 2023, the maximum availability of the senior revolving credit facility was reduced to million following the dissolution of Escalade Insurance, Inc. 

On October 11, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment (the Fifth Amendment to the Restated Credit Agreement. The Fifth Amendment eliminated the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and related provisions. The fixed charge ratio covenant was replaced by a new minimum interest coverage ratio covenant of to 1:00 effective September 30, 2024. Under the terms of the Fifth Amendment, the Company and the Lender also agreed to decrease the maximum availability under the senior revolving credit facility from million to million, but added an accordion feature that could increase the facility in an amount not to exceed million. The Fifth Amendment further revised the restricted payments covenant to provide that if at any time the Company s Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio would exceed to 1.0, then the aggregate combined total of cash dividends and Company share repurchases may not exceed million in any trailing twelve month period. 

The Company was in compliance with the debt covenants set forth in the Restated Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal amount of the term loan was million and total amount drawn under the Revolving Facility was million. 

compared to for the same three month period last year. The effective tax rate for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 was compared to for the same period last year. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2024 is primarily due to the recognition of gain on the sale of stock in Harvard Sports, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Escalade, Inc., which was completed during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Another factor causing an increase in rate from the prior year is the dissolution of the Company s captive insurance company. In prior years, the premiums paid to the captive were included in book income, but were non-taxable, resulting in a decrease in tax rate. With the dissolution of the captive in 2023, Escalade no longer has this non-taxable income to reduce its income tax rate.

Overview 

Escalade, Incorporated (Escalade, the Company, we, us or our) is focused on growing its Sporting Goods business through organic growth of existing categories, strategic acquisitions, and new product development. The Sporting Goods business competes in a variety of categories including basketball goals, archery, billiards, indoor and outdoor game recreation and fitness products. Strong brands and on-going investment in product development provide a solid foundation for building customer loyalty and continued growth. 

Within the sporting goods industry, the Company has successfully built a robust market presence in several niche markets. This strategy is heavily dependent on expanding our customer base, barriers to entry, strong brands, excellent customer service and a commitment to innovation. A key strategic advantage is the Company s established relationships with major customers that allow the Company to bring new products to market in a cost effective manner while maintaining a diversified portfolio of products to meet the demands of consumers. In addition to strategic customer relations, the Company has substantial manufacturing and import experience that enable it to be a low cost supplier. 

To enhance growth opportunities, the Company has focused on promoting new product innovation and development and brand marketing. In addition, the Company has embarked on a strategy of acquiring companies or product lines that complement or expand the Company's existing product lines or provide expansion into new or emerging categories in sporting goods. A key objective is the acquisition of product lines with barriers to entry that the Company can take to market through its established distribution channels or through new market channels. Significant synergies are achieved through assimilation of acquired product lines into the existing Company structure. 

15

Management believes that key indicators in measuring the success of these strategies are revenue growth, earnings growth, new product introductions, and the expansion of channels of distribution. 

As the most significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic appear to have waned, consumer demand for the Company s products has slowed but remains above pre-COVID-19 demand. General economic conditions, inflation, recessionary fears, rising interest rates, changes in the housing market and declining consumer confidence also may impact the Company adversely. Management cannot predict the full impact of these factors on the Company. Due to the above circumstances and as described generally in this Form 10-Q, the Company s results of operations for the period ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for fiscal year 2024.

Revenue and Gross Margin 

Total net sales declined 7.7 on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, due to soft consumer demand and inventory destocking in most categories, partly offset by growth in the archery, safety, and basketball categories. During the third quarter, sales declined across most of our sales channels, partly offset by growth in our international and e-commerce. Our e-commerce channel experienced growth driven by our owned e-commerce sales. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total net sales declined 5.3 compared to the same period in 2023 again due to soft consumer demand and channel destocking, partly offset by growth in the Company s table tennis, basketball, and archery categories. 

Gross margin increased to 24.8 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 24.7 for the same period in 2023 primarily driven by improved fixed cost absorption, partly offset by increased cost of goods sold of 1.8 million due to non-recurring expenses associated with strategic cost rationalization initiatives, including the closure and sale of its Mexico operations. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) were 11.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 11.1 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of 0.6 million or 5.5 . SG A as a percent of sales is 17.2 for the third quarter of 2024 compared with 15.1 for the same period in the prior year. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A were 32.4 million compared to 31.1 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of 1.3 million, or 4.2 . SG A as a percent of sales is 17.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 15.7 for the same period in the prior year. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.9 compared to 19.0 for the same period last year.

On January 21, 2022, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Indian Industries, Inc. Indian ), entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2022 Restated Credit Agreement with its issuing bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Chase ), and the other lenders identified in the Restated Credit Agreement (collectively, the Lenders ). The 2022 Restated Credit Agreement amended and restated the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of January 21, 2019, as amended, in its entirety, and continues the existing Company s credit facilities which have been in place since April 30, 2009. The Company s indebtedness under the 2022 Restated Credit Agreement continues to be collateralized by liens on all of the present and future equity of each of the Company s domestic subsidiaries and substantially all of the assets of the Company (excluding real estate). Under the terms of the 2022 Restated Credit Agreement, Old National Bank was added as a Lender. The Lenders made available to Escalade and Indian a senior revolving credit facility with increased maximum availability of 65.0 million (the Revolving Facility ), up from 50.0 million, plus an accordion feature that would allow borrowings up to 90.0 million under the Revolving Facility subject to certain terms and conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility was extended to January 21, 2027. The Company may prepay the Revolving Facility, in whole or in part, and reborrow prior to the revolving loan maturity date. The 2022 Restated Credit Agreement further extended the maturity date for the existing 50.0 million term loan facility to January 21, 2027. 

In addition to the increased borrowing amount and extended maturity date, the 2022 Restated Credit Agreement provided a 7.5 million swingline commitment by Chase, replaced LIBOR with the replacement benchmark secured overnight financing rate, and adjusted certain financial covenants relating to the fixed charge coverage ratio. 

On July 18, 2022, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the 2022 Restated Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the First Amendment, the Lender increased the maximum availability under the senior revolving credit facility from 65.0 million to 75.0 million pursuant to the accordion feature in the 2022 Restated Credit Agreement. The First Amendment also adjusted the funded debt to EBITDA ratio financial covenant to 3:00 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2022. 

On October 26, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment ("Second Amendment to the 2022 Restated Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Second Amendment, the Lender increased the maximum availability under the senior revolving credit facility from 75.0 million to 90.0 million pursuant to the accordion feature in the 2022 Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment adjusted the funded debt to EBITDA ratio financial covenant to 3:25 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2022 and 3:00 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Second Amendment also modified the EBITDA definition to permit add-backs of a) up to 2.0 million for disposition related expenses; and b) up to 2.0 million for unusual or non-recurring expenses which are incurred prior to the end of fiscal year 2023 and which are subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent. 

17

On May 8, 2023, the Company entered into the Third Amendment (the Third Amendment to the Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment adjusted the funded debt to EBITDA ratio financial covenant to 4:25 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s second fiscal quarter of 2023, 3:00 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s third fiscal quarter of 2023, and 2:75 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 and thereafter. The Third Amendment adjusted the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant to 1:10 to 1:00 commencing as of the Company s fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 and 1:25 to 1:00 as of the end of the Company s first fiscal quarter of 2024 and thereafter. For the Company s second and third fiscal quarters in 2023, the Third Amendment suspended the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and added a minimum EBITDA covenant of 22.5 million as of the end of each such fiscal quarter. Under the terms of the Third Amendment, the Company and the Lender also agreed to decrease the maximum availability under the senior revolving credit facility from 90.0 million to 75.0 million, upon the consummation of the sale of the Company s Mexican subsidiary and the dissolution of Escalade Insurance, Inc. The proceeds from such sale and dissolution, respectively, will be used to partially prepay the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As reflected in the Fourth Amendment to the Restated Credit Agreement effective September 1, 2023, the maximum availability of the senior revolving credit facility was reduced to 85.0 million following the dissolution of Escalade Insurance, Inc. 

On October 11, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment (the Fifth Amendment to the Restated Credit Agreement. The Fifth Amendment eliminated the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and related provisions. The fixed charge ratio covenant was replaced by a new minimum interest coverage ratio covenant of 3.50 to 1:00 effective September 30, 2024. Under the terms of the Fifth Amendment, the Company and the Lender also agreed to decrease the maximum availability under the senior revolving credit facility from 75.0 million to 60.0 million, but added an accordion feature that could increase the facility in an amount not to exceed 85.0 million. The Fifth Amendment further revised the restricted payments covenant to provide that if at any time the Company s Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio would exceed 1.75 to 1.0, then the aggregate combined total of cash dividends and Company share repurchases may not exceed 12.0 million in any trailing twelve month period. 

The Company was in compliance with the debt covenants set forth in the Restated Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal amount of the term loan was 27.4 million and total amount drawn under the Revolving Facility was 2.1 million. 

The Company funds working capital requirements and shareholder dividends through operating cash flows and revolving credit agreements with its Lenders. The Company expects that cash generated from its 2024 operations and its access to adequate levels of revolving credit will provide it with sufficient cash flows for its operations and to meet growth needs. 

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not Required. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Escalade maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, could provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

In connection with the preparation of the Company s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and identified material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

18

The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. The Company did not design and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures because of the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting: 

Information technology general controls particularly as such controls related to user access, program change management, and ineffective complementary user-organization controls, which limited management s ability to rely on technology dependent controls relevant to the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Controls over the period end close process, including the review and approval process of journal entries, account reconciliations, segregation of duties conflicts, and consolidation of intercompany entries. 

Documentation and design of controls related to various key financial statement accounts and assertions. 

The risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring components of the Company s internal control framework such that internal control weaknesses were not detected, communicated, addressed with mitigating control activities, or remediated. 

These material weaknesses did not result in a misstatement of the Company s financial statements; however, they could have resulted in misstatements of interim or annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement that would not be prevented or detected. 

Notwithstanding such material weaknesses, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s consolidated financial statements included in the Quarterly Report are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for each of the periods presented. 

Remediation Plan and Status 

The Company s management and the Company s Audit Committee are committed to achieving and maintaining a strong internal control environment. Management, with the Audit Committee s oversight, is actively engaged in the planning for, and implementation of, remediation efforts to address the above described material weaknesses. 

In response to the material weaknesses discussed above, we plan to continue efforts already underway to remediate internal control over financial reporting, including the following: 

We engaged with a third-party resource to support our internal control testing and remediation efforts. 

We have hired an Internal Auditor, a senior level position. 

We conducted a risk assessment over our internal control environment, and we prioritized individual control deficiencies for remediation, including those which aggregated to the above material weaknesses. 

We are in the process of documenting and executing remediation action items, including expansion of mitigating controls where appropriate. 

We are implementing tools to enhance and centralize general information technology components. 

Management and our Audit Committee will monitor these specific remedial measures and the effectiveness of our overall control environment. The identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting will only be considered remediated when the relevant controls have operated effectively for a sufficient period of time for management to conclude that they have been remediated. We can provide no assurance as to when the remediation of these material weaknesses will be completed to provide for an effective control environment. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management of the Company has evaluated, under the supervision of and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the third quarter of 2024. 

19

There have been no changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred since the beginning of the Company s first quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
