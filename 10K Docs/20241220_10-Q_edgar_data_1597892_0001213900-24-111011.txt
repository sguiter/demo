STATEMENTS 

Unpledged Interest; and 

Yongzhou JIT may not merge with or acquire any third parties, or make investment in any third parties. 

Power of Attorney. 

Under the Power of Attorney, Guangzhou JIE grants
to Laidian the authority to exercise all the powers given to Guangzhou JIE as a shareholder of Yongzhou JIT.

execution of the Management Agreements will be those of Yongzhou JIT and will be recorded at the carrying amount basis of Yongzhou JIT,

 , the recurring operating loss resulted in an accumulated deficit of as of September 30, 2024. The Company generated
cash outflow from its operating activities of and cash inflow of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
the fluctuation of cash flows resulted in a working capital deficit of and as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. Management
believes these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. 

The continuation of the Company as a going concern
through the next twelve months is dependent upon (1) the continued financial support from its external financing, including bank loans
and issuance of its shares to potential shareholders, and (2) further implement management s business plan to extend its operations
and generate sufficient revenue and cash flows to meet its obligations. Management believes that it can obtain additional bank loans
and the issuance of common shares of the Company is available if the Company decides to do so and believes that the Company s operation
can generate enough revenue and cash to meet its obligation in the normal course of business in future because the Company s operations
are on the upward trend. While the Company believes in its ability to raise additional funds and in the viability of its strategy to
increase sales volume and cash flows, there can be neither any assurances to that effect, nor any assurance that the Company will be
successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations. 

These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the
possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may
result from the outcome of these uncertainties. The Company is working to devote more efforts to improve its operation and generate more
profits and cash flow. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic
plan provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.

contract in the same terms. In May 2024, the Company terminated the lease of one of the five dormitories rooms. The lease contract continued
except that the monthly lease payment declined to RMB per month since May 2024. 

Short-term Lease 

 Generally, the Company enters into lease contracts
to rent a plant area for use of its product manufacturing, laboratory for research and development and production office Plant
Leases in May each year. Plant leases were renewed every year upon re-negotiation of the lease term with the lessor. Each Plant
Lease has a lease term of 12 months but with varying plant sizes and unit rental fees, determined in the circumstances. The Company can
determine whether it will continue to lease the plant from the lessor and the lease terms if it continue the lease at the commencement
date of each Plant lease. Each Plant Lease is treated as a separate lease agreement. The Company elected not to recognize a right-of-use
asset and lease liability requirement to these Plants Leases, because it has a lease term of 12 months or less. The Company recognized
the lease payments in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments in the period in which the
obligation for those payments is incurred.

(c) 
 Credit risk 

Financial instruments that are potentially subject
to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. The Company believes the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables
is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short collection terms. The Company does not generally
require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding
the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. 

(d) 
 Interest rate risk 

As the Company has no significant interest-bearing
assets, the Company s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. 

The Company s interest-rate risk arises
from bank loans. The Company manages interest rate risk by varying the borrowing and maturity dates of variable rate debt, limiting the
amount of variable rate debt, and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, all bank loans were at fixed rates.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. 

In addition to historical information, the discussion
in this section of this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ
materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those
discussed in this section and those discussed in Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K, which filed on
May 26, 2024. 

We caution readers not to place undue reliance
on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically
required by law and the rules of the SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or
in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results
will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 

OVERVIEW 

Company Structure 

JRSIS Health Care Corporation
(the Company or JRSIS was incorporated on November 20, 2013 under the laws of the State of Florida. Through
its 100 held subsidiary JRSIS Health Care Limited JRSIS-BVI ), a limited liability company registered in British Virgin
Island BVI ), it holds 100 shares of Runteng Medical Group Co., Ltd Runteng ), a limited liability company
registered in Hong Kong. On April 12, 2022, Runteng organized and owned 100 of the equity in Laidian Technology (Zhongshan) Co., Ltd Laidian ), a wholly foreign-owned enterprise WFOE subsidiary registered under the law of the People s
Republic of China the PRC in Zhongshan City, Guangdong Province. 

Until March 31, 2022, Runteng
also owned 70 of the equity in Harbin Jiarun Hospital Co., Ltd Jiarun ), a for-profit hospital incorporated in Harbin City
of Heilongjiang province of the PRC and was fully disposed of on April 1, 2022. 

On November 30, 2023, the Company, through its
subsidiary Laidian, completed an acquisition transaction that resulted that the Company obtained 85.53 variable interest in Yongzhou
Jumi Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. Yongzhou JIT ). For a detail description of our corporate structure and contractual
arrangements and its related risks, see ITEM 1 Business in PART I elsewhere in Form 10-K filed on May 26, 2024. The transaction
represents a Reverse Acquisition rather than a normal business combination in that Yongzhou JIT is deemed to be the accounting
acquirer in the transaction. 

Management s discussion and analysis in
this section was based on the historic financial information of Yongzhou JIT as accounting acquirer. The financial statements represent
the assets and liabilities and the operations that were reflected on the historical financial statements for periods prior to the Reverse
Acquisition of Yongzhou JIT and will be recorded at the carrying amount basis of Yongzhou JIT. The consolidated financial statements after
the Reverse Acquisition included the assets and liabilities of the Company and Yongzhou JIT, and the historical operations of Yongzhou
JIT and operations of the Combined Company from the date of the Reverse Acquisition. 

Technology and Innovation 

We, through Yongzhou JIT,
are committed to technological advancement and delivering cutting-edge smart machine and system solutions, especially for our One-stop
smart medicine distribution program and our new retail smart terminal solution to meet the evolving needs of our customers. The technicians
employed by Yongzhou JIT are committed to mastering intelligent algorithms and techniques, smart terminal technologies and moving communication-related
technology as needed to elevate our products to a market lead. 

33 

As of the date of this report, Yongzhou JIT owns
2 patents for invention, 16 patents for utility models, 7 design patents and 21 software copyrights in the PRC. In addition, there are
several invention patents in the process of undergoing substantive examination by government authorities. All the core patented technologies
and models of patents and copyright have been applied in the Company s products and services. The Company had established a research
and development team composed of 8 experts, representing approximately 22 of the total employees of Yongzhou JIT. After years of efforts,
the Company holds an outstanding position in the field of intelligent medicine products in the PRC. In addition, to promote research and
innovation in smart medicine areas, the Company actively collaborates with several prominent research institutions and universities, such
as Hunan Institute of Technology, to keep our smart techniques being updated and advanced. 

Products and Services, Customers 

Based on techniques we control
and the plants and equipment we operate in China, we can provide our customers with customized goods and services, such as cloud-based
smart hardware/equipment and the related application system/software, open platform of software as a service, cloud-based vending equipment,
one-stop cloud-based medicine equipment (including automated drug sales, remote consultations, unmanned pharmacies) and a series of remote
smart terminal products. We currently engage in the business of developing additional technology related to the medical industry and are
producing and selling equipment based on our technology. We also provide services to design, develop, install, and maintain cloud-based
systems for our customers. 

Currently, all our operations are conducted in
the PRC. Our customers include: a) governmental projects: such as local government s healthcare project to up-grate its smart medical
insurance, smart epidemic prevention measures, smart and system service on remote physical examination, health testing, remote consultation,
prescription, payments and medicine delivery etc.; b) Hospital projects: such as a smart application system in a hospital for collecting
drug information from each out-patient and directing the pharmacies in the hospital to prepare the dug for the out-patient and guide the
put-patient to the right window to take his/her medicine; c) pharmacies outside the hospital and d) entities in health industry, such
as the internet service platform; e) other entities providing smart health services based and depending on our technology. Our products
and services can be applied in more and more areas along with the development of Smart City and Smart Life project all over the PRC and
throughout the world. 

Recent Development 

With the popularity of China s mobile payment,
the update and development of cloud computing and the Internet of Things, coupled with the social demand for medical and pharmaceutical
services facilitation, personalization, privacy protection, and various convenient services launched by the government and social forces
in response to aging, vending and online services have a broad basis for development in most cities in China. Our smart products and services
will be widely used in this environment, which is also one of the infrastructures for building a healthy China. However, this will require
substantial investment from government and society. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially since this year, the enthusiasm
of the Chinese government and enterprises for such infrastructure investment has fluctuated with the changes in the macro economy, especially
the expectations of China s medium and long-term economic development. This kind of expected fluctuation has a great impact on the
market for our smart products. We need to overcome the difficulties brought by this fluctuation and seek greater development while continuously
improving the scientific and technological content of our products and services, which requires more effort and patience from us. 

GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. 

34 

As reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company incurred significant net losses of 509,680 and
 31,415. The recurring operating loss resulted in an accumulated deficit of 3,878,835 as of September 30, 2024. The Company generated
cash outflow from its operations activities of 826,061 and cash inflow from operations of 420,966 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023. The fluctuation of cash flows resulted in a working capital deficit of 512,474 as of September 30, 2024. Management
believes these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. 

The continuation of the Company as a going concern
through the next twelve months is dependent upon (1) the continued financial support from its external financing, including bank loans
and issuance of its shares to potential shareholders. Management believes that it can obtain additional bank loans and the issuance of
common shares of the Company is available if the Company elects to do so, and (2) further implementation of management s business
plan to extend its operations and generate sufficient revenue and cash flows to meet its obligations. The Company s operations are
on an upward trend, and management believes that the Company s operations can generate enough revenue and cash to meet its obligations
in the normal course of business. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to increase sales volume and in its ability
to raise additional funds, there can be neither any assurances to that effect, nor any assurance that the Company will be successful in
securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations. 

These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effect of the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from
the outcome of these uncertainties. The Company is working to improve its operations and generate more profits and cash flow. 

Management believes that the actions presently
being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plan provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going
concern. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including
those related to revenue recognition, receivable, inventory, leases, and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience,
known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in
which they become known. 

In connection with the preparation of our financial
statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no accounting estimate we made that was subject to a high
degree of uncertainty and was critical to our results. 

Please refer to our significant accounting policies
in NOTE 3 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We believe those accounting policies affect
our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue 

Total revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 222,922, a decrease of 274,439, or approximately 55 , as compared to total revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2023 of 497,361. Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,320,738, an increase of 8,988, or approximately
1 , as compared to total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 1,311,750. Currently, due to the bad economic environment,
without the support of the government s stimulus policies, Chinese society has grown increasingly cautious about investing in the
medical and health industry, resulting in a significant decline in the demand for our products and services. During the third quarter
of 2024, we did not acquire any new clients, resulting in our revenue being reduced by half compared to the same period in 2023. The revenue
decline in the third quarter of 2024 erased much of the growth achieved in the first two quarters of the year compared to 2023. 

36 

We have taken more aggressive measures in our
marketing and promotion efforts to improve our sales performance since the beginning of 2024. We initially expected that the demand for
our products and services in the market could be expected to grow rapidly. However, the macroeconomic and social demand in the PRC is
far less robust than it was expected in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Especially, since the third quarter of this year, the overall
economic vitality is relatively depressed, which has seriously affected the sales of the company s products and services. We have committed
to iterate and update continuously our products and services with our developing technology, and we expect that our revenue will continue
to grow along with our marketing effort and the upgrading of our products in the foreseeable future. However, the growth of our revenue
also depends on the microeconomic and social demand in the PRC. 

Currently, the Company s revenue derives
from two sources: 1) sales of smart terminal products, such as unmanned medicine vending machines, that the Company self-manufactures
and assembles in its plant, and 2) services rendered, such as installation and debugging of new equipment, maintenance of terminal systems
of smart equipment, design and development of application systems customized for our customers. Goods and services from which the Company
derived its revenue are all based on the Company s technology and manufacturing capacity. 

The Company derived its revenue from both third-party
customers and related party customers. During the periods presented in these financial statements, the Company derived its revenue from
its related parties mainly, with sales to Guangzhou JIE, Guangzhou JIT, Youzhou Jingmi Health Technology Co., Ltd. and Yaolian (Guangzhou)
Wulinwang Co., Ltd. (see Note 12 for relationship of these related parties). In general, those related parties purchase a machine from
Yongzhou JIT and resell it to their customers. In addition, Yongzhou JIT provided installation and maintenance services for its customers
and was paid case by case under a range of negotiated rates. End users of the Company s goods and services mainly include medical
service organizations, business entities and local governments. 

Cost of revenue 

Cost of revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 196,037, a decrease of 181,215, or approximately 48 , as compared to cost of revenue recorded for the three months ended
September 30, 2023 of 377,252. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,050,519, an increase of 49,881, or
approximately 5 , as compared to cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 1,000,638. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we provided less personalized services and fewer products to our customers, mainly the related parties of YZ JIT, generating lower revenue.,
This is the main reason that lead to lower cost of revenues. The increase of the cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 resulted from an increase in the cost of labor, especially the cost of revenue from our technology service mainly consists of labor
cost to fulfill our services obligations. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of the machine sold and incremental cost to fulfil
the contracts with customers. 

Gross profit 

Gross profit for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 26,885, a decrease of 93,224, or approximately 78 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 120,109.
The gross margin was 12 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased from 24 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 270,219, a decrease of 40,893, or approximately 13 , as compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 311,112. The gross margin was 20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased from
24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Generally, our services revenue contributes a
higher margin than revenue from the sale of goods. In addition, our margins fluctuated based on customized contracts made with various
factors, including customer background and special requirements of our products and services. Also, gross profit was affected by whether
the customer is a third party or a related party. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we encountered severe market challenges,
and in order to increase our sales, we made a lot of price concessions, resulting in a halving of the gross margin in the third quarter
of 2024 and the same period of 2023, Fortunately, some of our service revenues generated significant gross margins in the first half of
2024, which resulted in our gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 being essentially flat with the gross margin for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

37 

Operating expenses 

Operating expenses consist mainly of research
and development, employee salary, marketing and advertising, logistics, auditing and legal services, other professional service and listing
support fees, depreciation and amortization, office rental fees and utilities that are underlying but not associated with production,
and so are not recorded as cost of inventories. 

Operating expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 were 233,075, an increase of 163,977, or approximately 237 , as compared to 69,098 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our selling expenses increased 96,518, our general and administrative expenses
increased 74,821 and our research and development expenses decreased 7,362, as compared to the same period of 2023. 

Operating expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 were 756,033, an increase of 446,173, or approximately 144 , as compared to 309,860 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our selling expenses increased 289,925, our general and administrative expenses
increased 212,396 and our research and development expenses decreased 56,148, as compared to the same period of 2023. 

The Company reduced its research and development
expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by reorganizing and streamlining its research team to save costs without
compromising the efficiency of its activities. The Company is committed to an on-going reorganization to optimize its expenditures to
respond to its deficiency of working capital and to make profits. The Company expects to invest more capital in its research and development
activities as its financial condition gets better. The increase of selling expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024 as compared to the same period of prior year, mainly resulted from the increase of the marketing and advertising activities to promote
sales in the current period. The increase of the general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024 mainly resulted from the increasing of the professional services and related listing fees for public trading markets, and inventories
counting loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other income (expense), net 

Other income mainly consists of: 1) non-capitalized
interest expense accrued from bank loans used for working capital; 2) gain or loss on disposal of inventories, equipment and other assets;
and 3) government subsidy on tax exemption. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 the Company reported other net loss of 13,780,
an increase of 2,053, or approximately 18 of other net loss, as compared to other loss of 11,727 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company reported other net loss of 20,951, a decrease of other net loss of
 3,659, or approximately 15 , as compared to other net loss of 24,610 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The fluctuation in other expenses for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 mainly resulted in fluctuation of non-capitalized interest
expense due to the reduction of bank loans. YZ JIT repaid more bank loan during the third of 2023 which result in the accrual of interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is less than that in the same period of 2024. However, before repaying bank loan
in third quarter in 2023, total interest expense was accrued and recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which made other
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 greater than the same period of 2024. 

Net income (loss) 

We reported a net loss of 219,977 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net income of 39,407 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 259,384
at our net income, or approximately 658 . We reported a net loss of 509,680 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to net loss of 31,415 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 478,265 at our net loss or approximately 1522 . 

38 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate
funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. On September 30,
2024, we had cash of 1,372 and a working capital deficit of 512,474 as compared to cash of 741 and a working capital deficit of 404,105
on September 30, 2023. 

To date, we have financed our operating and investing
activities mainly through cash generated from our current operating activities, borrowings from financial institutions and contributions
from our shareholders. We had plans to issue our common shares to finance more cash to supplement our working capital. We also planned
to finance our business under our management measures and financing policy along with our current financing resources, such as accelerating
the collection of receivables and slow down the payment of payable. We did not identify any material capital expenditures requirements
at the date of this report, but we were not sure that our cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs for
general corporate purposes for at least the next 12 months. As management measures and financing policies, we will continue to delay payment
and accelerate collection in our operations, as well as optimize and reduce expenses to overcome cash deficits in our normal course of
business in the foreseeable future. Even though we may, however, need additional cash resources in the future if we experience changes
in business conditions or other developments. We may also need additional cash resources in the future if we find and wish to pursue opportunities
for investment, acquisition, capital expenditure or similar actions. If we determine that our cash requirements exceed the amount of cash
we have on hand, we may seek to issue equity or equity-linked securities or obtain debt financing including additional bank loans. The
issuance and sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result
in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing
will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 

The following is a summary of cash provided by
or used in each of the indicated types of activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in our operating activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 826,061, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 420,966 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable
to a net loss of 509,680 for the period and was primarily increased by non-cash items such as a reversal of a 138,497 inventory impairment
charge, and by a 578,004 increase in accounts receivable from related parties and amortization of 161,191 in advances from customers
as income was recognized from completion of prepaid contracts. Net operating cash inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
resulted primarily from the following factors: 1) accounts receivable decreased by 144,135 in cash collected from third parties; 2) advances
to suppliers decreased by 294,389 due to receipt of inventories from venders; and 3) a decrease of inventories by 233,745 due to increase

Net cash provided by our operating activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 420,966. This was attributable to net loss 31,415 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 and was primarily adjusted by non-cash items such as (1) an aggregate total of 3,340 from right-of used assets amortization
expenses and interest expenses accrual of lease liabilities of operating leases, (2) depreciation and amortization expenses of long-lived
assets of 41,179, (3) an aggregate gain of 24,206 from disposal of impaired inventories, and (4) deferred income tax decrease of 4,487
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net operating cash inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted primarily
from the following factors: 1) accounts receivable from both third parties and related parties decreased aggregately by 312,421 due to
more cash collected from customers; 2) accounts payable to related parties increased by 203,521 due to delay payment for the purchase
from related parties; Cash inflows were offset by the following cash outflows factors: 1) an increase of advance to suppliers of 1,845
due to more inventories order from venders; 2) inventories increased by 18,258 due to the preparation for future goods sold; 3) prepaid
expenses and other receivables increased by 1,938 and accounts payable to third parties decreased by 48,784 due to the Company make
more payments at September 30, 2023; 4) advances from customers decreased by 3,803 due to revenue recognized from those advances; 4)
Taxes payable decreased by 4,296 representing the payable of taxes both corporation income tax and VAT; 5) cash paid for operation lease
liabilities of 4,455. 6) other payable and accrued liabilities decreased by 4,982 due to the Company made much more payment for its
utility. 

Investing Activities 

There was 9,182 used in purchase of intangible assets for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. 

There was 249 used in purchase of equipment for the nine months ended
September 30 2023. 

Financing Activities 

Net Cash provided by our financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 720,030. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash inflows provided by financial
activities included: 1) received cash from issuance of common shares of 20,045; 2) proceeds from bank loans of 1,278,186, 3) capital
contribution from our VIE s legal owners of 419,578; Cash outflows in financial activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 included: 1) net cash used in financing purpose between the Company and its related parties amount of 15,823 and; 2) repayments

Net cash used in our financing activities from
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 576,242. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received cash in our financial
activities from proceeds of bank loan of amount 426,482 and net cash provided by financing purpose between the Company and its related

inflation over the past few years has not had a significant impact on our results of operations. 

IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

We do not expect the adoption of recently issued
accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K 
229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, 
as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

40 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company s management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of the Company s financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal
control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the Company s transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for
preparation of the Company s financial statements and that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with
management authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that
could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies and procedures may deteriorate. 

The Company s management is also required
to assess and report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Section 404 ). We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation and the identification of a material weakness in internal control over financial
reporting described below, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that as of the
end of the period covered by this report the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: 

The relatively small number of employees who are responsible
for accounting functions prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control system. The Company may engage more employees
when more financial resources are available. 

Our internal financial staff lack expertise in identifying
and addressing complex accounting issued under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Currently, we are relying on external consultants
to assist us complying with the US GAAP financial reporting process. 

We are trying to improve our documentation system concerning
our existing financial processes, risk assessment and internal controls so as to provide sufficient and adequate records for the preparation
and disclosure of financial reporting process. Currently, we are relying on external consultants to assist us complying with the financial
reporting process. 

We do not presently have an audit committee. JRSIS will set up
an audit committee when more financial resources are available. 

Management s Remediation plan 

While management believes that the Company s
financial statements previously filed in the Company s SEC reports have been properly recorded and disclosed in accordance with
US GAAP, based on the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified above, we have designed and plan to
implement, or in some cases have already implemented, the specific remediation initiatives described below: 

The Company is currently looking for an outside
consultant with considerable public company reporting experience and breadth of knowledge of US GAAP to provide more training in connection
with the preparation and review of its financial statements to the employees. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
