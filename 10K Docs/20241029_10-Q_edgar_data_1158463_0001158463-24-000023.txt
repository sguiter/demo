 Forward-Looking Information 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the "Report") contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Report are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as "expects," "plans," "intends," "anticipates," "indicates," "remains," "believes," "estimates," "forecast," "guidance," "outlook," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "goals," "targets" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Additionally, forward-looking statements include statements that do not relate solely to historical facts, such as statements which identify uncertainties or trends, discuss the possible future effects of current known trends or uncertainties, or which indicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed, or assured. Forward-looking statements contained in this Report include, without limitation, statements regarding our outlook and future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans for future operations, including our JetForward initiatives, our financing arrangements and potential implications thereof on our business, our sustainability initiatives, the impact of industry or other macroeconomic trends affecting our business, seasonality, and our expectations regarding the wind-down of our Northeast Alliance with American Airlines Group Inc. (the "NEA") and the related impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and are based on information currently available to us. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors, including, without limitation, the risk associated with the execution of our strategic operating plans in the near-term and long-term; our extremely competitive industry; risks related to the long-term nature of our fleet order book; volatility in fuel prices and availability of fuel; increased maintenance costs associated with fleet age; costs associated with salaries, wages and benefits; risks associated with a potential material reduction in the rate of interchange reimbursement fees; risks associated with doing business internationally; our reliance on high daily aircraft utilization; our dependence on the New York metropolitan market; risks associated with extended interruptions or disruptions in service at our focus cities; risks associated with airport expenses; risks associated with seasonality and weather; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers for our aircraft, engines, and our Fly-Fi product; risks related to new or increased tariffs imposed on commercial aircraft and related parts imported from outside the United States; the outcome of legal proceedings with respect to the NEA and our wind-down of the NEA; risks associated with cybersecurity and privacy, including information security breaches; heightened regulatory requirements concerning data security compliance; risks associated with reliance on, and potential failure of, automated systems to operate our business; our inability to attract and retain qualified crewmembers; our being subject to potential unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs; reputational and business risk from an accident or incident involving our aircraft; risks associated with damage to our reputation and the JetBlue brand name; our significant amount of fixed obligations and the ability to service such obligations; our substantial indebtedness and impact on our ability to meet future financing needs; financial risks associated with credit card processors; risks associated with seeking short-term additional financing liquidity; failure to realize the full value of intangible or long-lived assets, causing us to record impairments; risks associated with disease outbreaks or environmental disasters affecting travel behavior; compliance with environmental laws and regulations, which may cause us to incur substantial costs; the impacts of federal budget constraints or federally imposed furloughs; impact of global climate change and legal, regulatory or market response to such change; increasing attention to, and evolving expectations regarding, environmental, social and governance matters; changes in government regulations in our industry; acts of war or terrorism; and changes in global economic conditions or an economic downturn leading to a continuing or accelerated decrease in demand for air travel. It is routine for our internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year progresses, and therefore it should be clearly understood that the internal projections, beliefs, and assumptions upon which we base our expectations may change prior to the end of each quarter or year. 
 Given the risks and uncertainties surrounding forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. You should understand that many important factors, in addition to those discussed or incorporated by reference in this Report, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Further information concerning these and other factors is contained in JetBlue's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K"). In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events discussed in this Report might not occur. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Report. Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

 Total 
 (1) Deferred revenue is included within other accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized passenger rev enue o f billion and billion, respectively, which was included in passenger travel liability at the beginning of the respective periods. 
 The Company elected the practical expedient that allows entities to not disclose the amount of the remaining transaction price and its expected timing of recognition for passenger tickets if the contract has an original expected duration of one year or less or if certain other conditions are met. We elected to apply this practical expedient to our contract liabilities relating to passenger travel and ancillary services as our tickets or any related passenger credits expire generally one year from the date of booking. 
 TrueBlue points are combined into one homogeneous pool and are not separately identifiable. As such, the revenue is comprised of points that were part of the air traffic liability balance at the beginning of the period as well as points that were issued during the period.

billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2031 (the "TrueBlue Notes"). The TrueBlue Notes bear interest at a rate of per annum, in each case payable quarterly in arrears beginning in December 2024. The TrueBlue Notes are scheduled to mature in September 2031, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the TrueBlue Issuers. 
 
 The TrueBlue Notes were issued under an indenture (the "TrueBlue Indenture"), dated as of August 27, 2024, by and among the TrueBlue Issuers, the guarantors party thereto (the "Guarantors") and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The TrueBlue Notes were sold pursuant to a purchase agreement, dated August 13, 2024, by and among the TrueBlue Issuers, the Guarantors and Goldman Sachs Co. LLC and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of the several initial purchasers identified therein. 
 
 The TrueBlue Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by each of the Guarantors. The TrueBlue Notes and the TrueBlue Note guarantees are secured, together with all outstanding obligations under the TrueBlue Term Loan Facility (as defined below), by a first lien on certain collateral in connection with the Company s customer loyalty program, TrueBlue (the "Collateral"). 
 
 At any time prior to August 27, 2027, the TrueBlue Issuers may redeem the TrueBlue Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof, plus an applicable "make-whole" premium. On or after August 27, 2027, the TrueBlue Issuers may redeem the TrueBlue Notes, in whole or in part, at the applicable redemption prices described in the Indenture. No sinking fund is provided for the TrueBlue Notes, which means the TrueBlue Issuers are not required to set aside funds periodically for redemption or retirement of the TrueBlue Notes. Upon the occurrence of certain circumstances, the TrueBlue Issuers will prepay a pro rata portion of the TrueBlue Notes. 
 
 The TrueBlue Indenture contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants including compliance with certain debt service coverage ratios and minimum liquidity requirements as well as events of default. In the case of an event of default with respect to the TrueBlue Issuers and/or the Guarantors arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding TrueBlue Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. 
 TrueBlue Senior Secured Term Loan Facility 
 In August 2024, the Company and Loyalty LP entered into a new senior secured term loan credit and guaranty agreement among the Company and Loyalty LP, as co-borrowers, the Guarantors, the lenders party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as collateral administrator, for a million senior secured term loan facility (the "TrueBlue Term Loan Facility") due 2029. The TrueBlue Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured, on a pari passu basis with the TrueBlue Notes, by the Collateral. The loans under the TrueBlue Term Loan Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to Term SOFR plus an applicable margin (subject to a Term SOFR floor), or another index rate plus an applicable margin. The TrueBlue Term Loan Facility is subject to quarterly amortization payments beginning in December 2024.

Convertible Senior Notes, Due through 2029 
 In August 2024, we issued million of convertible senior notes due in September 2029, consisting of an initial million offering and a subsequent million option, under an indenture, dated as of August 16, 2024 with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears in March and September of each year, beginning in March 2025. The notes are general unsecured senior obligations and will rank equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to our existing and future subordinated debt. The notes will effectively rank junior in right of payment to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. 
 Holders of the notes may convert them into shares of our common stock subsequent to December 31, 2024 but prior to June 1, 2029 only under certain enumerated circumstances, such as upon the satisfaction of the sale price condition, the satisfaction of the trading price condition, notice of redemption, or specified corporate events, and thereafter at any time upon conversion, the notes will be settled in cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and, at our election, in shares of our common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation. 
 The initial conversion rate of 163.3987 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of notes, corresponds to an initial conversion price of approximately per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including, but not limited to, the issuance of certain stock dividends on common stock, the issuance of certain rights or warrants, subdivisions, combinations, distributions of capital stock, indebtedness or assets, cash dividends and certain issuer tender or exchange offers. 
 We are not required to redeem or retire the notes periodically. We may, at our option, redeem any of the notes for cash at a redemption price of of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after September 1, 2027 until the 45th scheduled trading day before the maturity date, under certain circumstances. Additionally, holders may under specified conditions, have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the notes for a cash price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. 
 We have evaluated the conversion feature of this note offering for embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and ASC 470, Debt. Based on our assessment, separate accounting for the conversion feature of this note offering is not required. 
 Of the million convertible senior notes issued, we incurred million in issuance costs, which resulted in net proceeds of million. We used the net proceeds of the initial offering to retire million of our existing convertible senior notes, due 2026. As a result of this retirement, we recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of million, in the third quarter of 2024. This gain was included within other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, million (net of unamortized issuance costs) remains outstanding on these convertible notes.

 We utilize several credit card processors to process our ticket sales. Our agreements with these processors do not contain covenants, but do generally allow the processor to withhold cash reserves to protect the processor from potential liability for tickets purchased, but not yet used for travel. While we currently do not have any collateral requirements related to our credit card processors, we may be required to issue collateral to our credit card processors, or other key business partners, in the future.

of our full-time equivalent crewmembers were represented by labor unions. The pilot group, which represents of our full-time equivalent crewmembers, is covered by a collective bargaining agreement ("CBA"). Negotiations for an amended CBA began in May 2024. Our pilots are represented by ALPA. Our inflight crewmembers and flight instructors are represented by the Transport Workers Union of America ("TWU"); our other frontline crewmembers do not have third party representation. 
 ALPA 
 In January 2023, JetBlue pilots ratified a contract extension effective March 1, 2023, which included a ratification payment and adjustments to paid-time-off accruals resulting from the pay rate increases of million. JetBlue pilots received an additional pay rate increase in August 2024 from this ratification, which resulted in an adjustment to paid time-off accruals of million. These expenses are included within special items. 
 TWU 
 On July 14, 2022, TWU filed a representation application with the National Mediation Board ("NMB") seeking an election among the pilot instructors (called "Flight Instructors"). JetBlue disputed TWU s application alleging that "Flight Instructors" do not constitute a craft or class. On October 26, 2023, the NMB notified the participants that it rejected JetBlue s argument and ordered an election. The Flight Instructors voted for TWU representation. Contract negotiations for an initial CBA are ongoing and began in April 2024. 
 Non-Unionized Crewmembers 
 We enter into individual employment agreements with each of our non-unionized FAA-licensed crewmembers, which include dispatchers, technicians, inspectors, and air traffic controllers. Each employment agreement is for a term of and automatically renews for an additional unless either the crewmember or we elect not to renew it by giving at least days' notice before the end of the relevant term. Pursuant to these agreements, these crewmembers can only be terminated for cause. In the event of a downturn in our business that would require a reduction in work hours, we are obligated to pay these crewmembers a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits if they do not obtain other aviation employment. 
 Legal Matters 
 Occasionally, we are involved in various claims, lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, and other legal matters involving suppliers, crewmembers, customers, and governmental agencies, arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain. The Company believes it has valid defenses to the legal matters currently pending against it, is defending itself vigorously, and has recorded accruals determined in accordance with GAAP, where appropriate. In making a determination regarding accruals, using available information, we evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party and record a loss contingency when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These subjective determinations are based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultation with legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may materially differ from our current estimates. It is possible that resolution of one or more of the legal matters currently pending or threatened could result in losses material to our condensed consolidated results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition. 
 To date, none of these types of litigation matters, most of which are typically covered by insurance, has had a material impact on our operations or financial condition. We have insured and continue to insure against most of these types of claims. A judgment on any claim not covered by, or in excess of, our insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our condensed consolidated results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition. 
 As previously disclosed, in July 2020, JetBlue and American Airlines Group Inc. ("American") entered into the Northeast Alliance (the "NEA"), which was designed to optimize our respective networks at JFK Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and Boston Logan International Airport. On September 21, 2021, the United States Department of Justice, along with the Attorneys General of six states and the District of Columbia filed suit against JetBlue and American seeking to enjoin the NEA, alleging that it violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The court issued a decision on May 19, 2023, permanently enjoining the NEA, and shortly thereafter we initiated a wind down of the NEA. On July 28, 2023, the court issued its Final Judgement and Order Entering Permanent Injunction, which took effect on August 18, 2023 (the "Final Injunction"). The wind down of the NEA is substantially complete, but remaining impacts could require us to incur additional costs and

putative class actions lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York ("EDNY") and the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, respectively, alleging that the NEA violates Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Among other things, plaintiffs seek monetary damages on behalf of a putative class of direct purchasers of airline tickets from JetBlue and American and, depending on the specific case, other airlines on flights to or from NEA airports from July 16, 2020 through the present. Plaintiffs in these actions also seek to enjoin the NEA. JetBlue moved to dismiss the claims. In September 2024, the court issued its Decision and Order denying JetBlue s motion to dismiss the consolidated NEA civil class action cases pending in the EDNY. We continue to believe these lawsuits are without merit.

 Any outstanding derivative instrument exposes us to credit loss in connection with our fuel contracts in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our agreements; however, we do not expect that any of our counterparties will fail to meet their obligations. The amount of such credit exposure is generally the fair value of our outstanding contracts for which we are in a receivable position. To manage credit risks we select counterparties based on credit assessments, limit our overall exposure to any single counterparty, and monitor the market position with each counterparty. Some of our agreements require cash deposits from either JetBlue or our counterparty if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount. 
 We have master netting arrangements with our counterparties allowing us the right of offset to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. The financial derivative instrument agreements we have with our counterparties may require us to fund all, or a portion of, outstanding loss positions related to these contracts prior to their scheduled maturities. The amount of collateral posted, if any, is periodically adjusted based on the fair value of the hedge contracts. Our policy is to offset the liabilities represented by these contracts with any cash collateral paid to the counterparties. 
 There were offsetting derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Part I, Item 2 of this Report should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2023 Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties.

 OVERVIEW 
 Third Quarter 2024 Results 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we incurred 60 million in net loss, compared to a net loss of 153 million for the same period in 2023. We continued to progress on our revenue initiatives in the third quarter. W e saw revenue strength in our premium product offerings, with Even More Space, preferred seating, and Mint performing well. Also, our Blue Basic carry-on bag changes implemented this quarter, helped bolster our revenue results. In addition, improvements in our operational metrics resulted in greater cost efficiencies. Fuel prices declined over the quarter and we continued to make progress on our cost savings programs, allowing us to maintain low costs for the quarter. 
 Our third quarter 2024 highlights include the following: 
 Third quarter 2024 system available seat miles ("ASMs" or "capacity") decreased by 3.6 compared to the third quarter of 2023 . 
 Systemwide on-time performance for the third quarter 2024 was 70.7 compared to 58.5 for the same period in 2023. 
 Completion factor increased to 98.1 in the third quarter of 2024 from 96.3 in the same period in 2023.

 Operating expense per available seat mile ("CASM") for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 0.7 year-over-year to 14.35 cents compared to the third quarter of 2023 . 
 Our operating expense for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 included the effects of special items. Excluding aircraft fuel, special items, and operating expenses related to our non-airline businesses, our operating expense (1) was 1.8 billion , an increase of 1.1 year-over-year. 
 Excluding fuel, special items, and operating expenses related to our non-airline businesses, our cost per available seat mile ("CASM ex-fuel") (1) increased by 4.8 to 10.62 cents in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 . 
 For the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, our reported loss per share was 0.17 and 0.46, respectively. Excluding special items, our adjusted loss per share (1) for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 0.16 and 0.39, respectively. 
 Recent Developments 
 JetForward 
 In July 2024, JetBlue announced JetForward, our strategic framework focused on four priority moves: delivering reliable and caring service, building the best east coast leisure network, offering products and perks customers value, and providing a secure financial future. Our JetForward plan, which is designed to support our long-term profitability goals, reflects various assumptions regarding factors that may impact our operational and financial performance. For further information on potential factors that could affect the success of our strategic initiatives, including JetForward, see our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Network 
 We are committed to refocusing our network in 2024 to high-performing leisure, visiting-friends-and-relatives and transcontinental routes in core geographies like New York, New England, Florida, and Puerto Rico. 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we announced a number of network changes, which included 15 station closures and over 50 route exits. 
 During the quarter, we redeployed aircraft to leisure-focused routes originating from Northeast airports, such as Rhode Island's T.F. Green International Airport and Connecticut's Bradley International Airport. 
 Customer Experience and Products 
 During the quarter, we continued to make enhancements to our customer experience by increasing the value of our product offerings and customer experience. 
 We announced plans for the opening of airport lounges at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) Terminal 5 and Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) Terminal C. The JFK lounge is expected to open in late 2025, with the BOS lounge expected to follow shortly thereafter. 
 We implemented a baggage policy update to the Blue Basic fare, which now includes a free carry-on bag. We also expanded the co-brand portfolio with the announcement of a premium co-branded credit card. Furthermore, we announced plans to improve the Even More Space bo oking process and onboard soft product experience. 
 Sustainability 
 We signed a new commercial agreement to purchase, during the initial 12-month period, approximately 3.3 million gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel (with an option to purchase up to an additional 13.3 million gallons). 
 Liquidity 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 4.1 billion in liquidity, which included unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and long-term marketable securities. In addition, we had a 600 million Citibank line of credit. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed the following financing transactions: 
 raised approximately 2.8 billion in proceeds through the issuance of 9.875 senior secured notes due 2031 ("TrueBlue Notes") and borrowings under a new senior secured term loan facility due 2029 (the "TrueBlue Term Loan Facility", collectively the "TrueBlue Financings"); 
 issued 460 million of 2.50 convertible senior notes; 
 issued 350 million in floating rate equipment notes; 
 entered into 607 million of sale-leaseback transactions; and 
 repaid 631 million on our outstanding debt and finance lease obligations, including the early retirement of 425 million related to our existing 0.50 convertible senior notes. 
 Refer to Note 3 to our condensed consoli dated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information on these financing transactions. 
 Pratt Whitney 
 In July 2023, Pratt Whitney, a division of RTX Corporation, announced the requirement, mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (" FAA" ), for removal of certain engines for inspection due to a rare condition in powdered metal used to manufacture certain engine parts on the PW1100G and PW1500G engine types. These engines power our Airbus A220 and Airbus A321neo fleets. The rare condition powdered metal affects engines manufactured between October 2015 and September 2021. Engines are now required to be inspected after they have reached a reduced number of cycles dependent on the fleet type. As a result of these required inspections and other engine reliability deficiencies, as of September 30, 2024, we had 11 aircraft

 grounded due to lack of engine availability. The Company currently expects each removed engine to take up to 360 days to complete a shop visit and return to a serviceable condition. For the full year ended December 31, 2024, the Company expects an average of 11 aircraft grounded. We currently expect aircraft out of service in 2025 to average in the mid-to-high teens. 
 Given that we expect to have a certain number of aircraft groundings into 2024 and beyond, we will continue to assess the resulting impact on our future capacity plans. We are currently working with Pratt Whitney on compensation arrangements. 
 While we are working with Pratt Whitney to secure compensation for 2024, the full impact of the removal and any potential remediation steps remains uncertain. The effect of aircraft groundings due to lack of engine availability, including but not limited to a reduction in capacity, could adversely impact our operations and financial results.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Overview 
 We reported net loss of 60 million , operating loss of 38 million and an operating margin of (1.6) for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This compares to net loss of 153 million, an operating loss of 156 million and an operating margin of (6.6) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our loss per share was 0.17 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a loss per share of 0.46 for the same period in 2023. Net loss decreased 93 million year-over-year primarily due to lower fuel costs. 
 Our reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included the effects of special items. Adjusting for these one-time items, our adjusted net loss (1) was 54 million, adjusted operating loss (1) was 11 million, adjusted operating margin (1) was (0.4) , and adjusted loss per share (1) was 0.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included the effects of special items. Adjusting for these one-time items, our adjusted net loss (1) was 129 million, adjusted operating loss (1) was 123 million, adjusted operating margin (1) was (5.2) , and adjusted loss per share (1) was 0.39 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 On-time performance, as defined by the DOT, is arrival within 14 minutes of scheduled arrival time. In the third quarter of 2024, our systemwide on-time performance was 70.7 compared to 58.5 for the same period in 2023. Our completion factor increased to 98.1 in the third quarter of 2024 from 96.3 in the same period in 2023. 
 Operating Revenues 
 (Revenues in millions; percent changes based on unrounded numbers) Three Months Ended September 30, Year-over-Year Change 2024 2023 Passenger revenue 2,198 2,201 (3) (0.1) Other revenue 167 152 15 9.8 Total operating revenues 2,365 2,353 12 0.5 Average fare 207.46 201.73 5.73 2.8 Yield per passenger mile (cents) 15.17 14.89 0.28 1.9 Passenger revenue per ASM (cents) 13.13 12.68 0.45 3.6 Operating revenue per ASM (cents) 14.13 13.55 0.58 4.3 Average stage length (miles) 1,298 1,253 45 3.6 Revenue passengers (thousands) 10,596 10,911 (315) (2.9) Revenue passenger miles (millions) 14,491 14,777 (286) (1.9) Available seat miles (ASMs) (millions) 16,740 17,362 (622) (3.6) Load factor 86.6 85.1 1.5 pts. 
 Passenger revenue is our primary source of revenue, which includes seat revenue and baggage fees, as well as revenue from our ancillary product offerings such as Even More Space. Passenger revenue was flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 . This was mainly driven by a 3.6 reduction in capacity, offset by a 1.9 increase yield per passenger mile. 
 Other revenue is primarily comprised of the marketing component of the sales of our TrueBlue points. It also includes revenue from the sale of vacation packages, airport concessions and advertising revenue. The year-over-year increase in other revenue of 15 million, or 9.8 , was principally driven by an increase in TrueBlue marketing revenue due to higher customer spend as well as an increase in vacation bookings.

These increases were partially offset by commitment fees incurred in 2023 related to the 3.5 billion Senior Secured Bridge Facility, but canceled in March 2024 in connection with the termination of the merger with Spirit. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased by 11 million, or 55.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in short term investments due to the proceeds received from the TrueBlue Financings. 
 Gain on Debt Extinguishments 
 Gain on debt extinguishments increased by 22 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This gain was due to the early retirement on a portion of our 0.50 convertible senior notes, due 2026 .

 (2) Includes aircraft temporarily removed from service, including aircraft impacted by the Pratt Whitney engine groundings and lack of engine availability. 
 We expect our operating results to significantly fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter in the future due to factors such as economic conditions, weather events, cost of aircraft fuel, and various other factors, many of which are outside of our control. As an example, air traffic controller shortages in the Northeast and Florida continue to cause disruptions in the industry, resulting in the FAA waiving the minimum usage requirement and permitting us to voluntarily turn in up to 10 of our slots in the New York area to help protect our operations. Even with a reduced number of flights, we experienced and continue to expect challenges in the operating environment. Consequently, we believe quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful; you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance. Except for uncertainty related to the cost of aircraft fuel, we expect our expenses to continue to increase as we acquire additional aircraft and as our fleet ages. 
 Operational challenges have impacted our business in 2024 and may impact our business in the future. Additionally, reliability challenges with some of our aircraft engines using new technology have led to grounded aircraft events. These challenges have resulted - and are expected to continue to result - in flight delays and cancellations. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The airline business is capital intensive. Our ability to successfully execute our growth plans is largely dependent on the continued availability of capital on attractive terms. In addition, our ability to successfully operate our business depends on maintaining sufficient liquidity. We believe we have adequate resources from a combination of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities on hand, and available lines of credit. Additionally, our unencumbered assets could be an additional source of liquidity, if necessary.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 In July 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the Facility ), dated July 29, 2024, among JetBlue, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (the "Second Amendment"), which modifies the Facility to, among other things, (i) extend the final maturity of the Facility to October 21, 2029; (ii) adjust the margin and the minimum liquidity requirements of the Company; (iii) replace the sustainability adjustment mechanism; (iv) allow for certain additions of eligible collateral; and (v) remove provisions relating to the terminated merger agreement with Spirit. 
 In August 2024, we raised approximately 2.8 billion in proceeds through the issuance of the TrueBlue Financings, which in each case are secured by collateral consisting of assets related to our TrueBlue loyalty program. We also raised 460 million in proceeds through the issuance of 2.50 convertible senior notes, due 2029. The initial net proceeds from the 2.50 convertible senior notes were used to retire a portion of our existing 0.50 convertible senior notes, due 2026. Refer to Note 3 to our condensed consoli dated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information on these financing transactions. 
 In the future, we may decide to seek additional financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing shares of our capital stock, offering debt or other equity securities or refinancing outstanding debt or securities. Issuing additional shares of our capital stock, other equity securities or additional securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders, reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Our debt agreements contain various affirmative, negative and financial covenants and complying with certain of these covenants, or entering into agreements with additional covenants, may restrict our ability to pursue our strategy or otherwise constrain our operations. Failure to comply with these covenants could lead to an event of default under the agreements, which may result in, among other things, an acceleration of outstanding obligations under such agreements. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the availability, amount, timing, or nature of our future offerings. As a result, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their percentage ownership. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and long-term marketable securities of 4.1 billion, which we believe will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of this Report, and we expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with our projected cash from operations, available lines of credit and debt financing. 
 We believe a healthy liquidity position is a crucial element of our ability to weather any part of the economic cycle while continuing to execute on our plans for profitable growth and increased returns. Our goal is to continue to be diligent with our liquidity, maintain financial flexibility, and be prudent with capital spending. 
 
 Analysis of Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities 
 We rely primarily on operating cash flows to provide working capital for current and future operations. Cash flows from operating activities were 161 million and 486 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flow is driven by the change in working capital and Spirit merger termination. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, flight equipment capital expenditures included 992 million related to the purchase of aircraft and spare engines as well as aircraft interior modifications. Flight capital expenditures also included 65 million in spare part purchases. Other property and equipment capital expenditures included ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements for 70 million. Investing activities for the current year period also included 942 million in net purchases of investment securities, 75 million in aircraft pre-delivery deposit payments and 22 million in Spirit shareholder payments. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, flight equipment capital expenditures included 618 million related to the purchase of aircraft and spare engines as well as aircraft interior modifications.

 Financing Activities 
 Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of 2.8 billion in proceeds from the TrueBlue Financings, 460 million from the issuance of the 2.50 convertible senior notes, 607 million in proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions, and 350 million in proceeds from the issuance of equipment notes to finance certain aircraft. Additionally, we issued 31 million of common stock relating to our crewmember stock purchase plan. These proceeds were partially offset by 631 million in payments on our outstanding debt and finance lease obligations, which includes the retirement of a portion of our existing 0.50 convertible senior notes. 
 Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions of 523 million, issuance of 78 million in equipment notes to finance certain aircraft and issuance of common stock of 31 million related to our crewmember stock purchase plan. These proceeds were partially offset by 254 million in payments on our outstanding debt and finance lease obligations. 
 Working Capital 
 We had working capital of 800 million and a working capital deficit of 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our working capital increased by 2.3 billion primarily due to an increase in cash and investment securities from raising 2.8 billion in proceeds from the TrueBlue Financings and raising 460 million in proceeds from the issuance of the 2.50 convertible senior notes. These increases were offset in part by 631 million in payments on our outstanding debt and finance lease obligations, which included an early retirement of a portion of our 0.50 convertible senior notes. 
 We expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash, investment securities, and internally generated funds, supplemented, as necessary, by financing activities which may be available to us. However, we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from future developments related to the extremely competitive environment in which we operate, or from events beyond our control, such as volatile fuel prices, economic conditions, weather-related disruptions, airport infrastructure challenges, the spread of infectious diseases, the impact of other airline bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, U.S. or international military actions, acts of terrorism, or other external geopolitical events and conditions. We believe there is sufficient liquidity available to us to meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.

 The amounts stated above do not include additional obligations incurred as a result of financing activities executed after September 30, 2024. 
 (1) Includes actual interest and estimated interest for floating-rate debt. Estimated floating rate is equal to Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus a margin based on September 30, 2024 rates. 
 (2) Amounts represent obligations based on the current delivery schedule set forth in our Airbus order book as of September 30, 2024. 
 (3) Amounts primarily include non-cancelable commitments for flight equipment maintenance, construction and information technology. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the material covenants of our debt and lease agreements.

 In August 2024, JetBlue co-issued with JetBlue Loyalty, LP, the TrueBlue Notes and TrueBlue Term Loan Facility. The agreements governing the TrueBlue Notes and TrueBlue Term Loan Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants including compliance with certain debt service coverage ratios and minimum liquidity requirements. These agreements also contain events of default, including a cross-default to other material indebtedness. 
 We have approximately 59 million of restricted cash pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain leases that will expire at the end of the related lease terms. Approximately 63 of our owned property and equipment and intangible assets at net book value were pledged or committed to be pledged as security under various loan agreements.

All aircraft temporarily removed from service are expected to return to operation in the future. 
 (2) Embraer E190 excludes 13 permanently parked owned aircraft and 8 parked aircraft awaiting lease return. 
 Of our operating fleet, 259 are owned by us, 28 are leased under operating leases, and none are leased under finance leases. Our owned aircraft include aircraft associated with sale-leaseback transactions that did not qualify as sales for accounting purposes. As of September 30, 2024, the average age of our operating fleet wa s 12.0 years.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Committed expenditures for our aircraft and spare engines include estimated amounts for contractual price escalations and pre-delivery deposits. We expect to meet our pre-delivery deposit requirements for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short-term borrowing facilities for deposits generally required six to 24 months prior to delivery. Any pre-delivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft. 
 Depending on market conditions, we anticipate using a mix of cash and debt financing for aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2024. Although we believe debt and/or lease financing should be available to us, we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to secure financing on attractive terms, if at all. To the extent we cannot secure financing on terms we deem attractive, we may be required to pay in cash, further modify our aircraft acquisition plans, or incur higher than anticipated financing costs.

 REGULATION G RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures in this Report. Non-GAAP financial measures are financial measures that are derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements, but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they provide useful supplemental information that enables a meaningful comparison of our results to others in the airline industry and our prior year results. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The information below provides an explanation of each non-GAAP financial measure presented in this Report and shows a reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 Operating Expenses, excluding Fuel, Other Non-Airline Operating Expenses, and Special Items ("Operating Expenses ex-fuel") and Operating Expense ex-fuel per Available Seat Mile ("CASM ex-fuel") 
 Operating Expense per Available Seat Mile ("CASM") is a common metric used in the airline industry. Our CASM for the relevant periods are summarized in the table below. We exclude aircraft fuel, operating expenses related to other non-airline businesses, such as JetBlue Technology Ventures and JetBlue Travel Products, and special items from total operating expenses to determine Operating Expenses ex-fuel, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and we exclude the same items from CASM to determine CASM ex-fuel, which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the impact of these special items distorts our overall trends and that our metrics are more comparable with the presentation of our results excluding such impact. 
 We believe Operating Expenses ex-fuel and CASM ex-fuel are useful for investors because they provide investors the ability to measure our financial performance excluding items that are beyond our control, such as fuel costs, which are subject to many economic and political factors, as well as items that are not related to the generation of an available seat mile, such as operating expense related to certain non-airline businesses and special items. We believe these non-GAAP measures are more indicative of our ability to manage airline costs and are more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, special items included union contract costs and voluntary opt-out costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, special items included Spirit-related costs, union contract costs, voluntary opt-out costs, and Embraer E190 fleet transition costs . 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, special items included Spirit-related costs and union contract costs. 
 The table below provides a reconciliation of our total operating expenses (GAAP measure) to Operating Expenses ex-fuel, and our CASM to CASM ex-fuel for the periods presented.

 Operating Expense, Operating Loss, Adjusted Operating Margin, Pre-tax Loss, Adjusted Pre-tax Margin, Net Loss and Loss per Share, excluding Special Items, Gain (Loss) on Investments and Gain on Debt Extinguishments 
 Our GAAP results in the applicable periods were impacted by credits and charges that were deemed special items. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, special items included union contract costs and voluntary opt-out costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, special items included Spirit-related costs, union contract costs, voluntary opt-out costs, and Embraer E190 fleet transition costs . 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 special items included Spirit-related costs and union contract costs. 
 Certain net gains and losses on our investments and the gain on debt extinguishments were also excluded from our September 30, 2024 and 2023 non-GAAP results. 
 We believe the impact of these items distort our overall trends and that our metrics are more comparable with the presentation of our results excluding the impact of these items. The table below provides a reconciliation of our GAAP reported amounts to the non-GAAP amounts excluding the impact of these items for the periods presented.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Except as described below, there have been no material changes in market risks from the information provided in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Aircraft Fuel 
 Our results of operations are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10 increase in the September 30, 2024 cost per gallon of fuel. Based on projected fuel consumption for the next 12 months, including the impact of our hedging position, such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately 211 million. As of September 30, 2024, we have hedged approximately 20 for the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Interest 
 Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable-rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances. The interest rate is fixed for 6.8 billion of our debt and finance lease obligations, with the remaining 1.4 billion having floating interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, if interest rates were on average 100 basis points higher year-over-year, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 15 million. This amount is determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on our variable rate debt. 
 If interest rates were to average 100 basis points lower in 2024 than they were during 2023, our interest income from cash and investment balances would decrease by approximately 11 million. This amount is determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the balances of our money market funds and short-term, interest-bearing investments for the trailing twelve-month period. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), and our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The Notes Reserve Account shall be subject at all times to an Account Control Agreement. So long as the Collateral Custodian has not been notified by the Trustee or any Issuer that an Event of Default exists, then the Collateral Custodian shall, at the written direction of either Issuer from time to time cause the funds held in the Notes Reserve Account, from time to time, to be invested in one or more Cash Equivalents selected by such Issuer (which Cash Equivalents shall at all times be subject to the Lien created under this Indenture) provided that in no event shall the Collateral Custodian (i) have any responsibility whatsoever as to the validity or quality of any Cash Equivalent (or for determining whether any investment made qualifies under the definition of Cash Equivalent ), (ii) be liable for the selection of Cash Equivalents or for investment losses incurred thereon or in respect of losses incurred as a result of the liquidation of any Cash Equivalent before its stated maturity pursuant to this Section 4.17 or the failure of an Issuer to provide timely written

investment direction or (iii) have any obligation to invest or reinvest any such amounts in the absence of such investment direction. Following the Collateral Custodian s receipt of written notice from the Trustee or from an Issuer that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Collateral Custodian shall, unless directed by the Trustee (acting at the direction of the Permitted Noteholders) cease making or renewing such Investments, and the funds held in the Notes Reserve Account shall remain univested for so long as such Event of Default is continuing. The Collateral Custodian shall not have any obligation to invest or reinvest the funds held in the Notes Reserve Account on any day to the extent that the Collateral Custodian has not received investment instruction on or prior to 11 00 a.m. (New York City time) on such day. Notwithstanding anything else in this Indenture to the contrary, in no event shall any Issuer direct any investment in any such Cash Equivalent that will mature later than the Business Day before the next occurring Payment Date.

All income from such Cash Equivalents shall be retained in the Notes Reserve Account, subject to release as permitted by this Indenture. All investments in such Cash Equivalents shall be at the risk of Loyalty LP. All income from Cash Equivalents in the Notes Reserve Account shall be taxable to Loyalty LP (or its regarded parent entity), and the Collateral Custodian shall prepare and timely distribute to each of the Issuers, as required, Form 1099 or other appropriate U.S. federal tax forms with respect to such income.

Such forms shall, to the extent necessary, be updated as required by the Internal Revenue Service, and provided to the Collateral Custodian. The Collateral Custodian shall be entitled to rely on an opinion of legal counsel (which may be counsel to JetBlue) in connection with the reporting of any earnings with respect hereto provided , however, it is understood that the Collateral Custodian shall only be responsible for U.S. federal and state income reporting with respect to income earned on the Notes Reserve Account. In no event shall the Collateral Custodian be liable or responsible for the payment of taxes on any income earned on the Notes Reserve Account. JetBlue shall pay or reimburse the Collateral Custodian upon request for any transfer taxes or other similar taxes relating to the Notes Reserve Account actually incurred in connection herewith and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Collateral Custodian in respect of any amounts that the Collateral Custodian has paid in the way of such taxes. The Collateral Custodian does not have any interest in the funds held in the Notes Reserve Account deposited hereunder but is serving as bank and securities intermediary only and having only possession thereof. This paragraph shall

In such circumstances, the Trustee shall promptly direct the Collateral Custodian to wire such excess amounts from the Notes Reserve Account to the Notes Payment Account. 
 (e) If, on any Determination Date, Available Funds for the related Payment Date will not be sufficient to pay in full the amounts due pursuant to clauses (a) , (b) and (c) of Section 4.01 on the related Payment Date, Loyalty LP shall request by notice in writing (which may be the Payment Date Statement) to the Trustee that the Trustee, on or prior to the related Payment Date, transfer amounts in the Notes Reserve Account to the Notes Payment Account to the extent necessary so that Available Funds on the related Payment Date will be sufficient to pay such amounts on the related Payment Date. In such circumstances, the Trustee shall promptly direct the Collateral Custodian to wire such amounts from the Notes Reserve Account to the Notes Payment Account.

 (f) The Borrowers shall not be required to make payments under this Section 2.14 to any Lender if (i) a claim hereunder arises solely through circumstances peculiar to such Lender and which do not affect commercial banks in the jurisdiction of organization of such Lender generally, (ii) the claim arises out of a voluntary relocation by such Lender of its applicable lending office (it being understood that any such relocation effected pursuant to Section 2.18 is not voluntary ), or (iii) such Lender is not seeking similar compensation for such costs to which it is entitled from its borrowers generally in commercial loans of a similar size. 
 (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, regulations, requests, rules, guidelines or directives implemented after the Closing Date pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act shall be deemed to be a Change in Law provided that any determination by a Lender of amounts owed pursuant to this Section 2.14 to such Lender due to any such Change in Law shall be made in good faith in a manner generally consistent with such Lender s standard practice. 
 Section 2.15 Break Funding Payments . In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any SOFR Term Loan other than on a Payment Date (including as a result of the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default), (b) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any SOFR Term Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) the assignment (or reallocation) of any SOFR Term Loan other than on a Payment Date as a result of a request by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.18 or Section 10.08(d) , then, in any such event, at the request of such Lender, the Borrowers shall compensate such Lender for the loss, cost and expense sustained by such Lender attributable to such event provided that in no case shall this Section 2.15 apply to any payment pursuant to Section 2.10(b) . Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount reasonably determined in good faith by such 
 77 

Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Term Loan had such event not occurred, at the applicable rate of interest for such Term Loan (excluding, however the Applicable Margin included therein, if any), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Term Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts (and the basis for requesting such amount or amounts) that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be prima facie evidence of the amount due. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount due within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such certificate. 
 Section 2.16 Taxes . 
 (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any Obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes provided that if any Taxes are required by applicable law to be deducted or withheld from any amounts payable to any Recipient, as determined in good faith by the applicable Withholding Agent, then (i) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions or withholdings for such Indemnified Taxes (including deductions or withholdings for any Indemnified Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.16 ), the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes been made, (ii) the applicable Withholding Agent shall make such deductions or withholdings and (iii) the applicable Withholding Agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
 (b) In addition (and without duplication of any payments pursuant to clause (a) ), the Borrowers, shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
 (c) Without duplication of amounts payable pursuant to clause (a) or (b) , the Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify each Agent and each Lender, within thirty (30) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes paid by or on behalf of or withheld or deducted from payments owing to such Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any Obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16 and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. After an Agent or a Lender, as the case may be, learns of the imposition of Indemnified Taxes, such party will act in good faith to notify the Borrowers promptly of its obligation thereunder. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the 
 78 

Borrowers by a Lender, by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, or by the Collateral Administrator or the Master Collateral Agent on its own behalf, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrowers to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.16 , the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment to the extent available, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
 (e) Each Lender shall, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Administrator and the Master Collateral Agent (to the extent the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Administrator or the Master Collateral Agent has not been reimbursed by the Borrowers) for the full amount of any Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority that are attributable to such Lender and that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Administrator or the Master Collateral Agent, together with all interest, penalties, reasonable costs and expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, as determined by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Administrator or the Master Collateral Agent, respectively in good faith. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Administrator or the Master Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (f) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which any of the Borrowers is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law and as reasonably requested by the Borrowers, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or requested by the Borrowers as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, such Lender shall not be required to deliver any documentation pursuant to this clause (f) that such Lender is not legally able to deliver. 
 (g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter when the previously delivered certificates and or forms expire, or upon request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent) whichever of the following is applicable

 80 

(h) Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter when the previously delivered certificates and or forms expire, or upon request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), two (2) copies of IRS Form W-9 (or any successor form), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, certifying that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding. 
 (i) If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement or any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (i) , FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
 (j) If an Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, reasonably exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by one or more Loan Parties or with respect to which one or more Loan Parties has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16 , it shall pay over an amount equal to such refund to the applicable Loan Parties (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Parties under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent or such Lender incurred in obtaining such refund (including Taxes imposed with respect to such refund) and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund) provided that such Loan Parties, upon the request of such Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Parties (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Agent or such Lender in the event such Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (j) , in no event will any Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrowers pursuant to this clause (j) if, and then only to the extent, the payment of such amount would place such Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Agent or such Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This clause (j) shall not be construed to require any Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrowers or any other Person. 
 (k) Each of the Agents shall provide the Borrowers with two (2) properly completed and duly executed copies of, if it is a U.S. Person, IRS Form W-9 certifying that it is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding, and, if it is not a U.S. Person, (i) IRS Form W-8ECI with respect to payments to be received by it as a beneficial owner and (ii) IRS Form

 (m) Each party s obligations under this Section 2.16 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Term Loans and Term Loan Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations under any Loan Document. 
 Section 2.17 Payments Generally Pro Rata Treatment . 
 (a) The Borrowers shall make each payment or prepayment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14 or 2.15 , or otherwise) prior to 3 00 p.m. (New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 745 7th Avenue, New York, New York 10019, pursuant to wire instructions to be provided by the Administrative Agent, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14 , 2.15 and 10.04 shall be made directly by the Borrowers to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in U.S. Dollars. 
 (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
 (c) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04 , 8.04 , 8.07 or 10.04(d) , then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter 
 82 

received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. 
 (d) Pro Rata Treatment . 
 (i) Each payment by the Borrowers in respect of the Term Loans shall be applied to the amounts of such obligations owing to the Lenders pro rata according to the respective amounts then due and owing to the Lenders.

 Section 2.18 Mitigation Obligations Replacement of Lenders . 
 (a) If the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount or indemnification payment to any Lender under Section 2.14 or to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Term Loans hereunder, to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, to file any certificate or document reasonably requested by the Borrowers or to take other reasonable measures, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation, assignment, filing or other measures (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16 , as the case may be, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense (other than immaterial costs and expenses) and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby, jointly and severally, agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
 (b) If, after the date hereof, any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14 or if the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 , or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, Non-Extending Lender or Non-Consenting Lender then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, (i) prepay such Lender s outstanding Term Loans (on a non-pro rata basis), or (ii) require such Lender to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.02 ), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), in any case as of a Business Day specified in such notice from the Borrowers provided that (i) such terminated or assigning Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Term Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts due, owing and payable to it hereunder at the time of such termination or assignment, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees in the case of an assignment) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (ii) in the case of an assignment due to payments required to be made 
 83 

pursuant to Section 2.16 , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter. 
 Section 2.19 Certain Fees . The Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, pay (a) to the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arrangers, the fees to which each is respectively entitled as set forth in the fee letter, dated as of or about the date hereof (the Administrative Agent Fee Letter ), among the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, and the fee letter in respect of each Lead Arranger, dated as of or about the date hereof (each, a Lender Fee Letter ), between such Lead Arranger and the Borrowers, as applicable, and (ii) to the Collateral Administrator and the Master Collateral Agent the fees set forth in the fee letter, dated as of or about the date hereof (the Collateral Administrator and Master Collateral Agent Fee Letter and, together with the Administrative Agent Fee Letter and each Lender Fee Letter, the Fee Letters ), among the Collateral Administrator, the Master Collateral Agent and the Borrowers, in each case at the times set forth therein. Other than the amounts to be paid on the Closing Date, all amounts due and owing pursuant to the Fee Letters shall be subject to the payment priorities set forth in Section 2.10(b) . 
 Section 2.20 Erroneous Payments . 
 (a) If the Administrative Agent (x) notifies a Lender or other Secured Party, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender or other Secured Party (any such Lender, Secured Party or other recipient (and each of their respective successors and assigns), a Payment Recipient that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not after receipt of any notice under immediately succeeding clause (b)) that any funds (as set forth in such notice from the Administrative Agent) received by such Payment Recipient from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously or mistakenly transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Lender, other Secured Party or other Payment Recipient on its behalf) (any such funds, whether transmitted or received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise, individually and collectively, an Erroneous Payment and (y) demands in writing the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the Administrative Agent pending its return or repayment as contemplated below in this Section 2.20 and held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, and such Lender or other Secured Party shall (or, with respect to any Payment Recipient who received such funds on its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient to) promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter (or such later date as the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, specify in writing), return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same day funds (in the currency so received). A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Payment Recipient under this clause (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (b) Without limiting immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender, other Secured Party or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender or other Secured Party (and each of their respective successors and assigns), agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of 
 84 

principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in this Agreement or in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or (z) that such Lender, other Secured Party or other such recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part), then in each such case 
 (i) it acknowledges and agrees that (A) in the case of immediately preceding clauses (x) or (y), an error and mistake shall be presumed to have been made (absent written confirmation from the Administrative Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error and mistake has been made (in the case of immediately preceding clause (z)), in each case, with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment and 
 (ii) such Lender or other Secured Party shall (and shall cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of the occurrence of any of the circumstances described in immediately preceding clauses (x), (y) and (z)) notify the Administrative Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 8.11(b). 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to deliver a notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.20(b) shall not have any effect on a Payment Recipient s obligations pursuant to Section 2.20(a) or on whether or not an Erroneous Payment has been made. 
 (c) Each Lender or other Secured Party hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or other Secured Party under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender or other Secured Party under any Loan Document with respect to any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, against any amount that the Administrative Agent has demanded to be returned under immediately preceding clause (a). 
 (d) The parties hereto agree that (x) irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent may be equitably subrogated, in the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Payment Recipient that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights and interests of such Payment Recipient (and, in the case of any Payment Recipient who has received funds on behalf of a Lender or other Secured Party, to the rights and interests of such Lender or other Secured Party, as the case may be) under the Loan Documents with respect to such amount (the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights and (y) an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower provided that this Section 2.20 shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the Obligations of the Borrower relative to the amount (and or timing for payment) of the Obligations that would have been payable had such Erroneous Payment not been made by the Administrative Agent provided, 
 85 

further, that for the avoidance of doubt, immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y) shall not apply to the extent any such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from, or on behalf of (including through the exercise of remedies under any Loan Document), the Borrower for the purpose of a payment on the Obligations. 
 (e) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including, without limitation, any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine. 
 Each party s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 2.20 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender or other Secured Party, the termination of the Term Loan Commitments and or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document. 
 Section 2.21 Premium . Upon the occurrence of an Applicable Trigger Event, the Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of each Lender that holds an applicable Term Loan 
 (a) if such Applicable Trigger Event occurs prior to the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, 1.0 of the amount prepaid or repaid (or deemed prepaid or repaid) and 
 (b) if such Applicable Trigger Event occurs on or after the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, 0.0 of the amount prepaid or repaid (or deemed prepaid or repaid). 
 Any amounts payable in accordance with this Section 2.21 shall be presumed to be equal to the liquidated damages sustained by the Lenders as the result of the occurrence of the Applicable Trigger Event, and the Borrowers agree that it is reasonable under the circumstances currently existing. The Loan Parties expressly agree that (i) the premium is reasonable and is the product of an arm s length transaction between sophisticated business people, ably represented by counsel, (ii) the premium shall be payable notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at the time payment is made, (iii) there has been a course of conduct between Lenders and the Borrowers giving specific consideration in the transaction for such agreement to pay the premium, (iv) the Loan Parties shall be estopped hereafter from claiming differently than as agreed to in this Section 2.21 and Sections 2.12 and 2.13 , (v) the agreement to pay the premium is a material inducement to the Lenders to make the Term Loans, and (vi) the premium represents a good faith, reasonable estimate and calculation of the lost profits or damages of the Lenders and that it would be impractical and extremely difficult to ascertain the actual amount of damages to the Lenders or profits lost by the Lenders as a result of such Applicable Trigger Event. 
 86 

THE PREMIUM IS DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, AND THE PARTIES HERETO (OTHER THAN THE COLLATERAL ADMINISTRATOR) EACH ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SUCH DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE AND THAT THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT IS INTENDED TO BE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOT A PENALTY. 
 Section 2.22 Nature of Fees . Except as otherwise specified in the Fee Letter or the Collateral Administrator and Master Collateral Agent Fee Letter, as applicable, all Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, (a) to the Administrative Agent, as provided herein and in the Administrative Agent Fee Letter or (b) to the Collateral Administrator or the Master Collateral Agent, as applicable, as provided in the Collateral Administrator and Master Collateral Agent Fee Letter. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances. 
 Section 2.23 Right of Set-Off . Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default pursuant to Section 7.01(b) , the Administrative Agent, the Master Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Collateral Custodian and each Lender (and their respective banking Affiliates) are hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final but excluding the Escrow Accounts) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by the Administrative Agent, the Master Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Collateral Custodian and each Lender (or any of such banking Affiliates) to or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party against any and all of any such overdue amounts owing to such Person under the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent, the Master Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Collateral Custodian or such Lender shall have made any demand under any Loan Document provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender exercises any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so set off will be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.26(d) and, pending such payment, will be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (b) the Defaulting Lender will provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. Each Lender, the Master Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Collateral Custodian and the Administrative Agent agree promptly to notify the Loan Parties after any such set-off and application made by such Lender, the Master Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Collateral Custodian or the Administrative Agent (or any of such banking Affiliates), as the case may be, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender, the Master Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Collateral Custodian and the Administrative Agent under this Section 2.23 are in addition to other rights and remedies which such Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Master Collateral Agent, the Collateral Custodian and the Collateral Administrator may have upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default.

Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Master Collateral Agent to act on its behalf as the Master Collateral Agent under the Collateral Documents and authorizes the Master Collateral Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such rights, powers, authorities and privileges as are expressly delegated to the Master Collateral Agent by the terms hereof and the other Collateral Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

For any Act of Required Debtholders under the Collateral Agency and Accounts Agreement, the Collateral Administrator shall take instruction from the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Required Lenders) hereunder (which such instruction shall include a certification by the Administrative Agent as to the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans represented by such instruction). 
 (b) Each of the Lenders hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Administrator and the Master Collateral Agent, as applicable 
 (i) to execute (or direct the execution of) any documents or instruments or take any other actions reasonably requested by the Loan Parties to release a Lien granted to the Master Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, on any asset that is part of the Collateral of the Loan Parties (A) upon the payment in full of all Obligations (except for contingent obligations in respect of which a claim has not yet been made), (B) that is sold or to be sold or transferred as part of or in connection with any sale or other transfer permitted by the terms of this Agreement or under any other Loan Document to a Person that is

If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders with the consent of the Borrowers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)) (the Resignation Effective Date ), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), in consultation with the Borrowers, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above.

In the event no successor Collateral Administrator shall have been appointed within thirty (30) days after the giving of notice of such resignation, the Collateral Administrator may, at the expense of the Borrowers, petition any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor Collateral Administrator. The Administrative Agent upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Collateral Administrator and the Borrowers, may with or without cause remove and discharge the Collateral Administrator or any successor Collateral Administrator thereafter appointed from the performance of its duties under this Agreement. Promptly after giving notice of removal of the Collateral Administrator, the Administrative Agent shall appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a successor Collateral Administrator (which successor Collateral Administrator shall be reasonably acceptable to the Required Lenders and, so long as no Event of Default under Sections 7.01(b) , (f) , (g) , or (o) has occurred and is continuing, the Borrowers). Any such appointment shall be accomplished by written instrument and a copy shall be delivered to the Collateral Administrator and the successor Collateral Administrator, the Borrowers and the Master Collateral Agent. After the Collateral Administrator s resignation or removal hereunder, the retiring Collateral Administrator shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and the provisions of this Article 8 and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Collateral Administrator, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Collateral Administrator was acting as the Collateral Administrator.

 (d) In the event that the Collateral Custodian shall no longer have the deposit rating necessary for the Payment Account and Reserve Account to be Eligible Deposit Accounts, Loyalty LP shall be permitted to and, if requested by the Administrative Agent, shall promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days (as such deadline may be extended by the Administrative Agent) of (A) a Responsible Officer of JetBlue or Loyalty LP obtaining knowledge of such ratings change or (B) receipt by a Borrower of notice from the Administrative Agent of such ratings change, move the Payment Account and the Reserve Account, as applicable, to a depository institution (i) selected by Loyalty LP that that has the deposit rating necessary for the Payment Account and Reserve Account to be Eligible Deposit Accounts or (ii) that is otherwise approved by the Administrative Agent, and will, to the extent that such depository institution is 
 145 

not the same institution as the Collateral Administrator, cause such depository institution to execute an Account Control Agreement. 
 (e) Any entity into which any Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Agent shall be a party, or any entity to which substantially all of the business of such Agent may be transferred, shall be the Agent under this Agreement without further action. 
 Section 8.6 Independent Lenders . Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Master Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrowers, the value of and title to any Collateral, and all applicable laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement, and to extend credit to the Borrowers hereunder. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Master Collateral Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
 Section 8.7 Advances and Payments . 
 (a) On the date of each Term Loan, the Administrative Agent shall be authorized (but not obligated) to advance, for the account of each of the Lenders, the amount of the Term Loan to be made by it in accordance with its Term Loan Commitment hereunder. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Term Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith upon written demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to, but excluding, the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, the Interest Rate otherwise applicable to such Term Loan. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then (x) such amount shall constitute such Lender s Term Loan included in such Term Loan and the Borrowers shall not be obligated to repay such amount pursuant to the preceding sentence if not previously repaid and (y) if such amount was previously repaid by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent shall promptly make a corresponding amount available to the Borrowers. 
 (b) Any amounts received by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement (other than amounts to which the Administrative Agent is entitled pursuant to 
 146 

Sections 2.19 , 8.04 and 10.04 ), the application of which is not otherwise provided for in this Agreement, shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.10(b) . All amounts to be paid to a Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be credited to that Lender, after collection by the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds either by wire transfer or deposit in that Lender s correspondent account with the Administrative Agent, as such Lender and the Administrative Agent shall from time to time agree. 
 Section 8.8 Sharing of Setoffs . Each Lender agrees that, except to the extent this Agreement expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender, if it shall, through the exercise either by it or any of its banking Affiliates of a right of banker s lien, setoff or counterclaim against a Borrower or a Guarantor, including, but not limited to, a secured claim under Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim and received by such Lender (or any of its banking Affiliates) under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of its Term Loans as a result of which the unpaid portion of its Term Loans is proportionately less than the unpaid portion of the Term Loans of any other Lender (a) it shall promptly purchase at par (and shall be deemed to have thereupon purchased) from such other Lender a participation in the Term Loans of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of each Lender s Term Loans and its participation in Term Loans of the other Lenders shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Term Loans then outstanding as the principal amount of its Term Loans prior to the obtaining of such payment was to the principal amount of all Term Loans outstanding prior to the obtaining of such payment and (b) such other adjustments shall be made from time to time as shall be equitable to ensure that the Lenders share such payment pro-rata, provided that if any such non-pro-rata payment is thereafter recovered or otherwise set aside, such purchase of participations shall be rescinded (without interest). Each Loan Party expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that any Lender holding (or deemed to be holding) a participation in a Term Loan acquired pursuant to this Section or any of its banking Affiliates may exercise any and all rights of banker s lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by a Loan Party to such Lender as fully as if such Lender was the original obligee thereon, in the amount of such participation.

Each of the Guarantors further agrees that its guaranty hereunder is a primary obligation of such Guarantor and not merely a contract of surety. 
 (b) To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Guarantors waives presentation to, demand for payment from and protest to the Borrowers or any other Guarantor, 
 149 

and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment.

 (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Guarantors hereby waives any defense that it might have based on a failure to remain informed of the financial condition of the Borrowers and of any other Guarantor and any circumstances affecting the ability of the Borrowers to perform under this Agreement. 
 (e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor s guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or any other instrument evidencing any Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, or extent of any collateral therefor or by any other circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to this guaranty (other than payment in full in cash of the Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (other than those that constitute unasserted contingent indemnification obligations)). None of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Master Collateral Agent, the Collateral Custodian or any of the Lenders makes any representation or warranty in respect to any such circumstances or shall have any duty or responsibility whatsoever to any Guarantor in respect of the management and maintenance of the Obligations.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of the Loan Parties hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation or impairment for any reason, including, without limitation, any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, other than pursuant to a written agreement in compliance with Section 10.08 and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, netting, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations. To the extent permitted by applicable law, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of any Loan Party hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Master Collateral Agent, the Collateral Custodian or a Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Agreement or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision hereof or thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Loan Party or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Loan Party as a matter of law. 
 Section 9.3 Continuation and Reinstatement, Etc . Each Guarantor further agrees that its guaranty hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Secured Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of a Borrower or a Guarantor, or otherwise. 
 Section 9.4 Subrogation Fraudulent Conveyance .

If any amount shall be paid to such Guarantor for the account of the Borrowers relating to the Obligations prior to payment in full of the Obligations, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Master Collateral Agent, the Collateral Custodian and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Master Collateral Agent, the Collateral Custodian, the Depositary and the Lenders to be credited and applied to the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. Each Loan Party hereby agrees that (1) all Indebtedness and other payment obligations owed to JetBlue or any Guarantor by Loyalty LP or any other SPV Party shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to (and not subject to setoff, netting or recoupment prior to) the prior payment in full of all the Obligations (including interest accruing on and after the filing of any petition in bankruptcy or of reorganization of an obligor whether or not post filing interest is allowed in such proceeding) provided that, in the case of clause (1) above, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and neither the Required Lenders nor the Administrative Agent has provided written direction to cease such payments, any payments in 
 151 

respect of such Indebtedness and other payment obligations shall not be prohibited (to the extent not otherwise prohibited under any Loan Document) and (2) all Indebtedness and other payment obligations owed by JetBlue or any Guarantor to Loyalty LP or any other SPV Party shall not be subordinated or junior in right of payment to, and shall rank pari passu with, any other senior unsubordinated indebtedness or payment obligations of JetBlue or such Guarantor, as the case may be (for the avoidance of doubt, except for payment obligations that have priority solely as a matter of law). Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, in no event will setoff or netting apply with respect to amounts due from any Loan Party to Loyalty LP (or any other SPV Party pursuant to any Intercompany Agreement, the JetBlue Intercompany Note or any IP Agreement or with respect to funds such Loan Party has received pursuant to any TrueBlue Agreement or any Earn and Burn Agreement. 
 (b) Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of this Agreement, the Master Collateral Agent and each other Secured Party, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such Persons that this Agreement and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign, federal or state law to the extent applicable to the guaranties hereunder and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Master Collateral Agent, the other Secured Parties and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of each Guarantor under the guaranties hereunder at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the Obligations of such Guarantor under this guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
