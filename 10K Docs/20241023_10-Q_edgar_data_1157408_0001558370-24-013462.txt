 of annual revenue or less, which may vary from quarter to quarter. Each state and/or school district has variations in the school funding formulas and methodologies that it uses to estimate funding for revenue recognition at its respective schools. As the Company estimates funding for each school, it takes into account the state definition for count dates on which reported enrollment numbers will be used for per pupil funding. The parameters the Company considers in estimating funding for revenue recognition purposes include school district count definitions, withdrawal rates, new registrations, average daily attendance, special needs enrollment, academic progress, historical completion, student location, funding caps and other state specified categorical program funding. Under the contracts where the Company provides products and services to schools, the Company is responsible for substantially all of the expenses incurred by the school and has generally agreed to absorb any operating losses of the schools in a given school year. These school operating losses represent the excess of costs incurred over revenues earned by the virtual or blended public school (the school s expected funding), as reflected in its respective financial statements, including Company charges to the schools. To the extent a school does not receive sufficient funding for each student enrolled in the school, the school would still incur costs associated with serving the unfunded enrollment. If losses due to unfunded enrollments result in a net operating loss for the year that loss is reflected as a reduction in the revenues and net receivables that the Company collects from the school. A school net operating loss in one year does not necessarily mean the Company anticipates losing money on the entire contract with the school. However, a school s net operating loss may reduce the Company s ability to collect its management fees in full and recognized revenues are constrained to reflect the expected cash collections from such schools. The Company records the school s estimated net operating loss against revenues based upon the percentage of actual revenues in the period to total estimated revenues for the fiscal year. Actual school net operating losses may vary from these estimates or revisions, and the impact of these differences could have a material impact on results of operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s revenues included a reduction for net school operating losses at the schools of million and million, respectively. Because the Company has agreed to absorb any operating losses of the schools, the Company records the expenses incurred by the school as both revenue and expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Amounts recorded as revenues and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million and million, respectively. Subscription-based Contracts The Company provides certain online curriculum and services to schools and school districts under subscription agreements. Revenues from the licensing of curriculum under subscription arrangements are recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period. Revenues from professional consulting, training and support services are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period. In addition, the Company contracts with individual customers who have access for one to to company-provided online curriculum and generally prepay for services to be received. Adult learners enroll in courses that provide specialized training in a specific industry. Each of these contracts are considered to be one performance obligation. The Company recognizes these revenues pro rata over the maximum term of the customer contract based on the defined contract price.

 and , respectively, of the Company s General Education revenues, and and , respectively, of the Company s Middle High School Career Learning revenues, were from funding-based contracts. The following table presents the Company s revenues disaggregated based on its lines of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Career Learning Middle - High School Adult Total Career Learning Total Revenues Concentration of Customers During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had contracts that represented greater than 10 of total revenues. Contract Balances The timing of revenue recognition, invoicing, and cash collection results in accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (a contract asset) and deferred revenue (a contract liability) in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Accounts receivable are recorded when there is an executed customer contract and the customer is billed. An allowance is recorded to reflect expected losses at the time the receivable is recorded. The collectability of outstanding receivables is evaluated regularly by the Company to determine if additional allowances are needed. Unbilled receivables are created when revenue is earned prior to the customer being billed. Deferred revenue is recorded when customers are billed or cash is collected in advance of services being provided.

Table of Contents STRIDE, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 
 Unbilled receivables (included in accounts receivable) Deferred revenue Deferred revenue, long-term (included in other long-term liabilities) The difference between the opening and closing balance of the accounts receivable and unbilled receivables relates to the timing of the Company s billing in relation to month end and contractual agreements. The difference between the opening and closing balance of the deferred revenue relates to the timing difference between billings to customers and the service periods under the contract, as well as changes in the estimates of variable consideration. Typically, each of these balances are at their highest during the first quarter of the fiscal year and lowest at the end of the fiscal year. The amount of revenue recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 that was included in the previous July 1 st deferred revenue balance was million and million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded revenues of million and million, respectively, related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. Performance Obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For the majority of its contracts, the Company s performance obligations are satisfied over time, as the Company delivers, and the customer receives the services, over the service period of the contract. The Company s payment terms are generally net 30 or net 45 , but can vary depending on the customer or when the school receives its funding from the state. The Company has elected, as a practical expedient, not to report the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with customers that have an expected duration of one year or less. The amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with customers which extend beyond year as of September 30, 2024 was million. Significant Judgments The Company determined that the majority of its contracts with customers contain one performance obligation. The Company markets the products and services as an integrated package building off its curriculum offerings. It does not market distinct products or services to be sold independently from the curriculum offering. The Company provides the significant service of integrating the goods and services into the operation of the school and education of its students, for which the customer has contracted. The Company has determined that the time elapsed method is the most appropriate measure of progress towards the satisfaction of the performance obligation. Generally, the Company delivers the integrated products and services package over the course of the Company s fiscal year. This package includes enrollment, marketing, teacher training, etc. in addition to the core curriculum and instruction. All of these activities are necessary and contribute to the overall education of its students, which occurs evenly throughout the year. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis. The Company determined that the expected value method is the most appropriate method to account for variable consideration and the Company s forecasting method is an estimation process that uses probability to determine expected funding. On a monthly basis, the Company estimates the total funds each school will receive in a particular school year and the amount of full-year school revenues and operating expenses to determine the amount of revenue the Company will

Certain leases include renewal options, usually based upon current market rates, as well as termination rights.

Discount Rate The present value of the lease payments is calculated using either the rate implicit in the lease, or the lessee s incremental borrowing rate, over the lease term. For the majority of the Company s finance and operating leases, the stated rate is not defined within the lease terms. Therefore, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The level of performance determines the number of PSUs earned, and is generally measured against threshold, target and outperform achievement levels of the award. Each PSU represents the right to receive share of the Company s common stock, or at the option of the Company, an equivalent amount of cash, and is classified as an equity or liability award. When the grant is a fixed monetary amount, and the number of shares is not determined until achievement and the value of the Company s stock on that day, the PSU is a liability-classified award. Each PSU vests pursuant to the vesting schedule found in the respective PSU agreement. In addition to the performance conditions of the PSUs, there is a service vesting condition which is dependent upon continuing service by the grantee as an employee of the Company, unless the grantee is eligible for earlier vesting upon a change in control and qualifying termination, as defined by the PSU agreement. PSUs are generally subject to graduated vesting schedules and stock-based compensation expense is computed by tranche and recognized on a straight-line basis over the tranches applicable vesting period based on the expected achievement level.

Executive Summary We are a technology company providing an educational platform to deliver online learning to students throughout the U.S. Our platform hosts products and services to attract, enroll, educate, track progress, and support students.

 Our platform addresses two markets in the K-12 space: General Education and Career Learning. General Education Products and services for the General Education market are predominantly focused on core subjects, including math, English, science and history, for kindergarten through twelfth grade students to help build a common foundation of knowledge. These programs provide an alternative to traditional school options and address a range of student needs. Products and services are delivered as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering for schools or as stand-alone products and services. A student enrolled in a school that offers Stride s General Education program may elect to take career courses, but that student and the associated revenue is reported as a General Education enrollment and General Education revenue. Career Learning Career Learning products and services are focused on developing skills to enter and succeed in careers in high-growth, in-demand industries including information technology, healthcare and general business. We provide middle and high school students with Career Learning programs that complement their core general education coursework. Stride offers multiple career pathways through a diverse catalog of courses. The middle school program exposes students to a variety of career options and introduces career skill development. In high school, students may engage in industry content pathway courses, project-based learning in virtual teams, and career development services. High school students have the opportunity to progress toward certifications, connect with industry professionals, earn college credits while in high school, and participate in job shadowing and/or work-based learning experiences that facilitate success in today s digital, tech-enabled economy. A student is reported as a Career Learning enrollment and associated Career Learning revenue only if the student is enrolled in a Career Learning program. Like General Education products and services, the products and services for Career Learning are sold as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering or as stand-alone products and services. We also provide focused post-secondary career learning programs to adult learners, for the software engineering, healthcare, and medical fields. These programs are sold directly to consumers, employers and government agencies. For both the General Education and Career Learning markets, the majority of revenue is derived from our comprehensive school-as-a-service offering which includes an integrated package of curriculum, technology systems, instruction, and support services that we administer on behalf of our customers. The average duration of the agreements for our school-as-a-service offering is greater than five years, and most provide for automatic renewals absent a customer notification of non-renewal. For the 2024-2025 school year, we provide our school-as-a-service offering to 89 schools in 31 states and the District of Columbia in the General Education market, and 56 schools or programs in 27 states and the District of Columbia in the Career Learning market. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of curriculum, administration support and technology services to virtual and blended public schools. The amount of revenue generated from these contracts is impacted largely by the number of enrollments, the mix of enrollments across grades and states, state or district per student funding levels and attendance requirement, among other items. The average duration of the agreements for our school-as-a-service offering is greater than five years, and most provide for automatic renewals absent a customer notification within a negotiated time frame. The two key financial metrics that we use to assess financial performance are revenues and operating income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues increased to 551.1 million from 480.2 million in the prior year, an increase of 14.8 . Over the same period, operating income increased to 47.3 million from 3.3 million in the prior year. The increase in operating income was driven by revenue growth and an increase in gross margin. Additionally, we use the non-financial metric of total enrollments to assess performance, as enrollment is a key driver of our revenues. Total enrollments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 222.6 thousand, an increase of 34.7 thousand, or 18.5 , over the prior year. Our revenues are subject to annual school district financial audits, which incorporate enrollment counts, funding and other routine financial audit considerations. The results from these audits and other routine changes in funding estimates are incorporated into the Company s monthly funding estimates for the current and prior periods. Historically, aggregate funding estimates have differed from actual reimbursements, generally in the range of 2 of annual revenue or less, which may vary from quarter to quarter.

 Environmental, Social and Governance As overseers of risk and stewards of long-term enterprise value, Stride s Board of Directors play a vital role in assessing our organization s environmental and social impacts. They are also responsible for understanding the potential impact and related risks of environmental, social and governance ESG issues on the organization s operating model. Our Board and management aim to identify those ESG issues most likely to impact business operations and growth. We craft policies that are appropriate for our industry and that are of concern to our employees, investors, customers and other key stakeholders. Our Board helps ensure that the Company s leaders have ample opportunity to leverage ESG for the long-term good of the organization, its stakeholders, and society. Each Committee of the Board monitors ESG efforts in their respective areas, with the Nominating and Governance Committee coordinating across all Committees. Since our inception more than 20 years ago, we have removed barriers that impact academic equity. We provide high-quality education for anyone particularly those in underserved communities as a means to foster economic empowerment and address societal inequities from kindergarten all the way through college and career readiness. We reinforced our commitment in this area by launching several initiatives including initially offering scholarships to advance education and career opportunities for students in underserved communities, expanding career pathways in socially responsible law enforcement and increasing employment of teachers in underserved communities at Stride-powered schools. We developed interactive, modular courses focused on racial equity and social justice that are being made available for free to every public school. Among the many ESG issues we support within the Company, we endeavor to promote diversity and inclusion across every aspect of the organization. We sponsor employee resource groups to provide support for female, minority, differently abled, LGBTQ+, and veteran employees and support employee volunteer efforts. Our commitment is evident in the make-up of our leadership team. We have more minorities in executive management and more women in executive management than the representative population. Importantly, our Board of Directors is also diverse with female, Hispanic, and black or African American members. Our commitment to ESG initiatives is an endeavor both the Board and management undertake for the general betterment of those both inside and outside of our Company. The nature of our business supports environmental sustainability. Most of our employees work from home and most students at Stride-powered schools attend virtual classes, even prior to the COVID-19 crisis, reducing the carbon output from commuting in cars or buses. Our online curriculum reduces the need for paper. Our meetings are most often held virtually using digital first presentations rather than paper. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies and estimates are disclosed in our Annual Report. There have been no significant updates to our critical accounting estimates disclosed in our Annual Report. Results of Operations Lines of Revenue We operate in one operating and reportable business segment as a technology company providing an educational platform to deliver proprietary and third-party curriculum, software systems and educational services designed to facilitate individualized learning. The Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates profitability based on consolidated results. We have two lines of revenue: (i) General Education and (ii) Career Learning.

Financial Information The following table sets forth statements of operations data and the amounts as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Revenues 551,084 100.0 480,181 100.0 Instructional costs and services 335,231 60.8 307,293 64.0 Gross margin 215,853 39.2 172,888 36.0 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 168,509 30.6 169,568 35.3 Income from operations 47,344 8.6 3,320 0.7 Interest expense, net (2,353) (0.4) (2,068) (0.4) Other income, net 8,778 1.6 5,165 1.1 Income before income taxes and loss from equity method investments 53,769 9.8 6,417 1.3 Income tax expense (11,277) (2.0) (1,536) (0.3) Loss from equity method investments (1,610) (0.3) (3) (0.0) Net income attributable to common stockholders 40,882 7.4 4,878 1.0 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenues. Our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 551.1 million, representing an increase of 70.9 million, or 14.8 , from 480.2 million for the same period in the prior year. General Education revenues increased 30.1 million, or 10.0 , year over year. The increase in General Education revenues was primarily due to the 11.3 increase in enrollments, and school mix (distribution of enrollments by school). Career Learning revenues increased 40.8 million, or 22.6 , primarily due to a 30.4 increase in enrollments and school mix. Instructional costs and services expenses. Instructional costs and services expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 335.2 million, representing an increase of 27.9 million, or 9.1 , from 307.3 million for the 

 35 

Table of Contents 
 same period in the prior year. This increase in expense was due to hiring of personnel in growth states and salary increases. Instructional costs and services expenses were 60.8 of revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from 64.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 168.5 million, representing a decrease of 1.1 million, or 0.6 from 169.6 million for the same period in the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 30.6 of revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from 35.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income (expense), net. Net interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.4 million as compared to 2.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to our finance leases. Other income (expense), net. Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.8 million as compared to 5.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in other income, net was primarily due to the increase in our investments in marketable securities and the returns on those investments year over year. Income tax expense. Income tax expense was 11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, or 21.6 of income before income taxes, as compared to an expense of 1.5 million, or 23.9 of income before income taxes for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the excess tax benefit of stock-based compensation, which was partially offset by the tax impact of non-deductible compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had net working capital, or current assets minus current liabilities, of 1,060.7 million. Our working capital includes cash and cash equivalents of 317.8 million and accounts receivable of 675.7 million. Our working capital provides a significant source of liquidity for our normal operating needs. Our accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the fiscal year based on the timing of customer billings and collections and tends to be highest in our first fiscal quarter as we begin billing for students. In addition, our cash and accounts receivable were significantly in excess of our accounts payable and short-term accrued liabilities at September 30, 2024. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we issued 420.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.125 Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 Notes ). The Notes are governed by an indenture (the Indenture between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes were approximately 408.6 million after deducting the underwriting fees and other expenses paid by the Company. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.125 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 st and September 1 st of each year, beginning on March 1, 2021. The Notes will mature on September 1, 2027. In connection with the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the Capped Call Transactions with certain counterparties. The Capped Call Transactions are expected to cover the aggregate number of shares of the Company s common stock that initially underlie the Notes, and are expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company s common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes. The upper strike price of the Capped Call Transactions is 86.174 per share. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was 60.4 million and was recorded within additional paid-in capital. Before June 1, 2027, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. After June 1, 2027, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until two days prior to the maturity date. We will settle conversions by paying cash up to the outstanding principal amount, and at our election, will settle the conversion spread by paying or delivering cash or shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The initial conversion rate is 18.9109 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately 52.88 per share of common stock. The Notes will be redeemable at our option at any time after September 6, 2024 at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, subject to certain stock price hurdles as discussed in the Indenture. On January 27, 2020, we entered into a 100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility Credit Facility to be used for general corporate operating purposes with PNC Capital Markets LLC. The Credit Facility has a five-year term and incorporates customary financial and other covenants, including but not limited to a maximum leverage ratio and a

Table of Contents 
 minimum interest coverage ratio. The majority of our borrowings under the Credit Facility were at LIBOR plus an additional rate ranging from 0.875 - 1.50 based on our leverage ratio as defined in the agreement. The Credit Facility is secured by our assets. The Credit Facility agreement allows for an amendment to establish a new benchmark interest rate when LIBOR is discontinued during the five-year term. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants. As part of the proceeds received from the Notes, we repaid our 100.0 million outstanding balance and as of September 30, 2024, we had no amounts outstanding on the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility also includes a 200.0 million accordion feature. We are a lessee under finance lease obligations for student computers and peripherals under loan agreements with Banc of America Leasing Capital, LLC BALC and CSI Leasing, Inc. CSI Leasing ). As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the finance lease liability was 90.1 million and 55.6 million, respectively, with lease interest rates ranging from 2.25 to 6.72 . We entered into an agreement with BALC in April 2020 for 25.0 million (increased to 41.0 million in July 2020) to provide financing for our leases through March 2021 at varying rates. We entered into additional agreements during fiscal year 2021 to provide financing of 54.0 million for our student computers and peripherals leases through October 2022 at varying rates. Individual leases with BALC include 36-month payment terms, fixed rates ranging from 2.25 to 6.72 , and a 1 purchase option at the end of each lease term. We pledged the assets financed to secure the outstanding leases. We entered into an agreement with CSI Leasing in August 2022 to provide financing for our leases. Individual leases under the agreement with CSI Leasing include 36-month payment terms, but do not include a stated interest rate. We use our incremental borrowing rate as the implied interest rate and the total lease payments to calculate our lease liability. Our cash requirements consist primarily of day-to-day operating expenses, capital expenditures and contractual obligations with respect to interest on our Notes, office facility leases, capital equipment leases and other operating leases. We expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations. We believe that the combination of funds to be generated from operations, borrowing on our Credit Facility and net working capital on hand will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations on a short-term (the next 12 months) and long-term (beyond the next 12 months) basis. In addition, we continue to explore acquisitions, strategic investments and joint ventures related to our business that we may acquire using cash, stock, debt, contribution of assets or a combination thereof. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 142.0 million compared to 135.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 6.7 million increase in cash used for operations was primarily due to changes in working capital resulting from seasonal fluctuations in accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation and benefits, and accrued liabilities partially offset by higher net income in the current period as compared to the prior year quarter. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.9 million compared to 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 13.8 million. The increase was primarily due to higher net purchases of marketable securities of 15.0 million partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures year over year of 1.3 million. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.0 million compared to 13.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 6.2 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the repurchase of restricted stock for income tax withholding of 9.1 million partially offset by a decrease in the repayment of finance lease obligations incurred for the acquisition of student computers of 3.0 million.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Inflation Risk Current inflation has resulted in higher personnel costs, marketing expenses and supply chain expenses. There can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse or material impact on our operating results and financial condition. Interest Rate Risk As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 317.8 million and 500.6 million, respectively. Our excess cash has been invested in money market funds, government securities, corporate debt securities and similar investments. At September 30, 2024, a 1 gross increase in interest rates for our variable-interest instruments would result in a 3.2 million annualized increase in interest income. Additionally, the fair value of our investment portfolio is subject to changes in market interest rates. Our short-term debt obligations under our Credit Facility are subject to interest rate exposure. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding balance on our Credit Facility. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We currently operate in several foreign countries, but we do not transact a material amount of business in a foreign currency. If we enter into any material transactions in a foreign currency or establish or acquire any subsidiaries that measure and record their financial condition and results of operations in a foreign currency, we will be exposed to currency transaction risk and/or currency translation risk. Exchange rates between U.S. dollars and many foreign currencies have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and may continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, we may decide in the future to undertake hedging strategies to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on our financial condition and results of operations. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We carried out an evaluation, required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this review, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
