billion of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024 , there was billion available for repurchases under our stock repurchase plan. Our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased depends on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, shares withheld for taxes associated with the vesting of equity incentive awards and other corporate considerations. The current stock repurchase plan will expire on . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we repurchased an aggregate of shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share, including shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for certain employees upon the vesting of equity incentive awards.

million of deferred revenue in the remainder of 2024 , million in 2025 , and million thereafter . Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain and Costs to Fulfill Revenue Contracts We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if we expect the amortization period to be longer than one year. We also recognize an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if such costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. We have determined that substantially all costs related to implementation activities are administrative in nature and also meet the capitalization criteria under ASC 340-40. These capitalized costs to fulfill principally relate to upfront direct costs that are expected to be recovered through margin and that enhance our ability to satisfy future performance obligations. The assets related to both costs to obtain, and costs to fulfill, contracts with clients are accounted for utilizing a portfolio approach and are capitalized and amortized ratably over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be the estimated life of the client relationship of 10 years. The expected period of benefit has been determined to be the estimated life of the client relationship primarily because we incur no new costs to obtain, or costs to fulfill, a contract upon renewal. Additional commission costs may be incurred when an existing client purchases additional applications; however, these commission costs relate solely to the additional applications purchased and are not related to contract renewal. Furthermore, additional fulfillment costs associated with existing clients purchasing additional applications are minimized by our seamless single-database platform. These assets are presented as deferred contract costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense related to costs to obtain and costs to fulfill a contract is included in sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

We capitalize software development costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with ASC 350-40. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we capitalized million and million, respectively, of software development costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we capitalized million and million, respectively, of software development costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use. Rental clocks included in property and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheets, represent time clocks issued to clients under month-to-month operating leases. As such, these items are transferred from inventory to property and equipment and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Prior to the repayment of our debt on November 21, 2023, we capitalized interest costs incurred for indebtedness related to construction in progress. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred interest costs of million and

 of which was capitalized. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we incurred interest costs of million and million, respectively, of which we capitalized million and million, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. 

 million. We have selected June 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date. We performed a qualitative impairment test of our goodwill and concluded that, as of June 30, 2024 , it was more likely than not that the fair value exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, goodwill was t impaired. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no indicators of impairment. In connection with our marketing initiatives, we purchased the naming rights to the downtown Oklahoma City arena that is home to the Oklahoma City Thunder National Basketball Association franchise. Under the terms of the naming rights agreement, we committed to make payments escalating annually from million in 2021 to million in 2035. We also made a million one-time payment in July 2021 to cover sponsorship rights leading up to the 2021-2022 season. Upon the conclusion of the initial term, the agreement may be extended upon the mutual agreement of both parties for an additional five-year period. The cost of the naming rights has been recorded as an intangible asset with an offsetting liability as of the date of the contract. The intangible asset is being amortized over the life of the agreement on a straight-line basis that commenced in June 2021. The difference between the present value of the offsetting liability and actual cash payments is being relieved through sales and marketing expense using the effective interest method over the life of the agreement.

Unamortized debt issuance costs of million as of September 30, 2024 are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. On the Facility Closing Date, we borrowed million under the Revolving Credit Facility to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our prior credit facility, along with accrued interest, expenses and fees. The loan bore interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined below) for the interest period in effect plus . On , the Loan Parties entered into Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement with the Lenders, pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the aggregate revolving commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility were increased from million to billion, (ii) the Term Loan Facility was terminated and (iii) the Credit Agreement was amended in contemplation of the formation and future operating activities of the Paycom Client Trust (the Client Trust and Paycom National Trust Bank, NA (the Trust Bank ). The Company intends to form the Client Trust to hold client payroll and related funds and the Trust Bank to serve as trustee of the Client Trust. We did t make any draws under the Term Loan Facility prior to its termination on . At the time of termination, unamortized debt issuance costs totaling million were written off and recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt, which was included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. On November 21, 2023, we fully repaid the outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 , there was debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Alternate Base Rate ABR plus an applicable margin ABR Loans or (ii) (x) the term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus (the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or (y) the daily SOFR plus 0.10 , in each case plus an applicable margin SOFR Rate Loans ). ABR is calculated as the highest of (i) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal in the United States as the prime rate in effect, (ii) the federal funds rate plus and (iii) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for a one-month interest period plus ; provided that, if the ABR as determined pursuant to the foregoing would be less than 1.00 , such rate shall be deemed to be 1.00 . The applicable margin for ABR Loans is (i) if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.0 to 1.0; (ii) if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0 but less than 2.0 to 1.0; (iii) if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 but less than 3.0 to 1.0; or (iv) if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0. The applicable margin for SOFR Rate Loans is (i) if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.0 to 1.0; (ii) if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0 but less than 2.0 to 1.0; (iii) if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 but less than 3.0 to 1.0; or (iv) if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow under the Revolving Credit Facility and terminate or reduce the Lenders commitments at any time prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date. We are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the daily amount of the undrawn portion of the revolving commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate per annum of (i) if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.0 to 1.0; (ii) if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0 but less than 2.0 to 1.0; (iii) if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 but less than 3.0 to 1.0; or (iv) if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0. Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0 and a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0, stepping down to 3.25 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2024 and 3.0 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2025, and thereafter. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, grant liens, incur debt, effect certain mergers, make investments, dispose of assets, enter into certain transactions, including swap agreements and sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock, and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to customary exceptions. As of September 30, 2024 , we were in compliance with these covenants. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a senior security interest in all personal property of the Loan Parties.

 Overview 
 We are a leading provider of a comprehensive, cloud-based human capital management HCM solution delivered as Software-as-a-Service. We provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle, from recruitment to retirement. Our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all HCM functions, including payroll, talent acquisition, talent management, human resources management and time and labor management applications. Our user-friendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees, enabling self-management of their HCM activities in the cloud, which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity. 
 We generate revenues from (i) fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed and (ii) fixed amounts charged per billing period. Our billing period varies by client based on when each client pays its employees, which may be weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly. We serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry. None of our payroll and HCM clients constituted more than one-half of one percent of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives who sell new applications to existing clients. 
 Our continued growth depends on attracting new clients through further penetration of our existing markets and geographic expansion into new markets, targeting a high degree of client employee usage across our solution, and introducing new applications to our existing client base. We believe our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future, and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth. We plan to open additional sales offices in the future to further expand our market presence. 
 Our principal marketing efforts include national and local advertising campaigns, email campaigns, social and digital media campaigns, search engine marketing methods, sponsorships, tradeshows, print advertising and outbound marketing including personalized direct mail campaigns. In addition, we generate leads and build recognition of our brand and thought leadership with relevant and informative content, such as white papers, blogs, podcast episodes and webinars. 
 Throughout our history, we have built strong relationships with our clients. As the HCM needs of our clients evolve, we believe that we are well-positioned to expand the HCM spending of our clients, and we believe this opportunity is significant. To be successful, we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution, as well as effectively hire, train, motivate and retain qualified personnel. 
 21 

Growth Outlook, Opportunities and Challenges 
 As a result of our significant revenue growth and geographic expansion, we are presented with a variety of opportunities and challenges. Our payroll application is the foundation of our solution, and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications. Consequently, we have historically generated the majority of our revenues from our payroll applications, although our revenue mix has evolved and will continue to evolve as we develop and add new non-payroll applications to our solution. We believe our strategy of focusing on automation and employee usage is an important differentiator for attracting new clients and is also key to long-term client satisfaction and client retention. For example, our industry-first Beti technology automates and streamlines the payroll process by empowering employees to do their own payroll. Client adoption of new applications and, historically, client employee usage of both new and existing applications have been significant factors in our revenue growth. Nonetheless, because Beti is designed to eliminate payroll errors that lead to billable corrections and unscheduled payroll runs, we have experienced a reduction in these activities that historically would otherwise generate additional revenue for us. 
 In order to increase revenues and continue to improve our operating results, we must also attract new clients. We intend to obtain new clients by continuing to leverage our sales force productivity, further penetrating markets where we currently have existing sales offices, and expanding into new markets. 
 The market for HCM software is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented. We expect competition to continue to intensify as new market entrants and disruptive technologies emerge and increasingly aggressive pricing and client retention strategies persist. These market pressures directly affect our revenue growth and our ability to attract and retain clients. Our revenue growth rate and annual revenue retention rate declined in 2023 and have remained under pressure throughout 2024. While these trends may continue in the near-term, our long-term focused investments in automation, client ROI achievement, and world-class service are designed to counteract these recent negative trends. 
 Historically, our target client size range has been organizations with 50 to 10,000 employees. In 2023, we expanded our target client size range to include organizations with more than 10,000 employees. While we continue to serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees, the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer. We believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase our revenues per client, with limited incremental cost to us. Furthermore, with the launch of our Global HCM solution and expansion of payroll services into certain international markets, we expect that our ability to serve organizations with international employees makes our solution more attractive to larger companies, many of which have a global presence. Because we charge our clients on a per employee basis for certain services we provide, any increase or decrease in the number of employees of our clients will have a positive or negative impact, respectively, on our results of operations. A multitude of macroeconomic pressures, such as inflation and changes in interest rates, impact our clients hiring practices to varying degrees and, in turn, impact our revenues. Generally, we expect that changes in certain factors affecting our performance will correlate with improvement or deterioration in the labor market. For example, the performance of our pre-employment services offerings is sensitive to changes in hiring trends, and we believe it will reflect any slowdown in hiring among U.S. employers. 
 We collect funds from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services. Those collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt, with some funds being held for up to 120 days. We typically invest funds held for clients in money market funds, demand deposit accounts, U.S. treasury securities, certificates of deposit and commercial paper until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. As we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients, we expect our average funds held for clients balance and, accordingly, interest earned on funds held for clients, will increase; however, the amount of interest we earn can be positively or negatively impacted by changes in interest rates. 
 Growing our business has resulted in, and will continue to result in, substantial investments in sales professionals, operating expenses, system development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses, which have increased and will continue to increase our expenses. Specifically, our revenue growth and geographic expansion drive increases in our employee headcount, which in turn precipitates increases in (i) salaries and benefits, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and (iii) facility costs related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters and operations facilities and additional sales office leases. Furthermore, execution of our international expansion strategy requires considerable investment. As a result of the factors described above, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience pressure on our margins as we hire to support growth. 
 We believe the challenges of managing the ever-changing complexity of payroll and human resources will continue to drive companies to turn to outsourced providers for help with their HCM needs. The HCM industry historically has been driven, in part, by legislation and regulatory action, including COBRA, changes to the minimum wage laws or overtime rules, and legislation from federal, state or municipal taxation authorities. 
 Our revenues are seasonal in nature. Generally, we expect our first and fourth quarter recurring revenues to be higher than other quarters during the year because payroll tax filing forms and Affordable Care Act forms are typically processed in the first quarter, and unscheduled payroll runs (such as bonuses) for our clients are typically concentrated in the fourth quarter. In addition, these seasonal fluctuations in recurring revenues impact operating income.

Revenues 
 The increase in recurring revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was the result of the addition of new clients in our target market range, increased revenue per client attributable to the realization of pricing strategies and the impact of new product and service offerings, and increased interest earned on funds held for clients. We believe that a decrease in the sale of additional applications to existing clients adversely affected the magnitude of the period-over-period increase in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in interest earned on funds held for clients was due to higher interest rates and a higher average funds held for clients balance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The average daily balance of funds held for clients was 2.4 billion and 2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Implementation and other revenues are composed primarily of non-refundable upfront conversion fees, which are collected from new clients and are deferred and recognized ratably over the 10-year estimated life of our clients. The net decrease in implementation and other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to decreases in historic client access fees and revenues from the sale of time clocks, offsetting an increase in non-refundable upfront conversion fees recognized during the period. The increase in implementation and other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily the result of an increase in non-refundable upfront conversion fees recognized during the period. 
 23 

Expenses 
 Cost of Revenues 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses increased from the comparable prior year period by 15.2 million, primarily due to an 8.9 million increase in employee-related expenses attributable to growth in the number of operating personnel, a 4.8 million increase in shipping and supplies fees and a 0.4 million increase in banking fees. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 4.2 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to the development of additional technology, purchases of other related fixed assets, and the impact of our corporate headquarters expansion that was placed into service in April 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses increased from the comparable prior year period by 38.6 million, primarily due to a 25.6 million increase in employee-related expenses attributable to growth in the number of operating personnel, a 7.3 million increase in shipping and supplies fees and a 3.0 million increase in banking fees. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 10.6 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to the development of additional technology, purchases of other related fixed assets, and the impact of our corporate headquarters expansion that was not in service in the prior year period. 
 Administrative Expenses 
 Sales and Marketing 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses increased from the comparable prior year period by 3.3 million due to a 3.2 million increase in employee-related expenses, including commissions and bonuses and a 0.1 million increase in marketing and advertising expense. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses increased from the comparable prior year period by 15.7 million due to a 21.6 million increase in employee-related expenses, including commissions and bonuses, which was partially offset by a 5.9 million decrease in marketing and advertising expense. 
 Research and Development 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses increased from the comparable prior year periods due to increases in employee-related expenses of 11.2 million and 32.3 million, respectively. 
 As we continue the ongoing development of our platform and product offerings, we generally expect research and development expenses (exclusive of stock-based compensation) to continue to increase, particularly as we hire more personnel to support our growth. While we expect this trend to continue on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of total revenues, we also anticipate the rate of increase to decline over time as we leverage our growth and realize additional economies of scale. As is customary for our business, we also expect fluctuations in research and development expense as a percentage of revenue on a quarter-to-quarter basis due to seasonal revenue trends, the introduction of new products, the amount and timing of research and development costs that may be capitalized and the timing of onboarding new hires and restricted stock vesting events. 
 Expenditures for software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a three-year period on a straight-line basis. The nature of the development projects underway during a particular period directly impacts the timing and extent of these capitalized expenditures and can affect the amount of research and development expenses in such period. The table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

General and Administrative 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.2 million from the comparable prior year period due to a decrease in employee-related expenses of 1.5 million, which was partially offset by a 0.3 million increase in accounting and legal expenses. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased 120.8 million from the comparable prior year period due to a 117.5 million reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense related to the forfeiture of a restricted stock award (the 2020 CEO Performance Award upon Chad Richison s transition to Co-Chief Executive Officer, a 1.9 million decrease in other employee-related expenses and a 1.4 million decrease in accounting and legal expenses.

Depreciation and Amortization 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the comparable prior year periods primarily due to the development of additional technology, purchases of other related fixed assets, and the impact of our corporate headquarters expansion that was placed into service in April 2024. 
 Interest Expense 
 The increases in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year periods, were primarily due to the timing of our expansion project at our corporate headquarters, which resulted in a higher capitalization rate of interest in the comparable prior year periods. 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 The decreases in other income (expense), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year periods, were primarily attributable to decreases in interest earned on our corporate funds due to lower cash balances. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we earned interest on our corporate funds of 4.2 million and 13.3 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we earned interest on our corporate funds of 6.5 million and 17.9 million, respectively. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes is based on a current estimate of the annual effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the impact of discrete items. Our effective income tax rate was 21.9 and 28.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the tax benefit related to the forfeiture of the 2020 CEO Performance Award in February 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of capital and liquidity are our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposit accounts and money market funds. Additionally, we maintain a 1.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ), which can be accessed as needed to supplement our operating cash flow and cash balances. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 We have historically funded our operations from cash flows generated from operations, cash from the sale of equity securities and debt financing. We are funding our ongoing capital expenditures from available cash. Further, to date, all cash dividends and purchases under our stock repurchase plan have been funded from available cash. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to maintain operations, make necessary capital expenditures, pay dividends and opportunistically repurchase shares for at least the next 12 months. In addition, based on our strong 
 25 

profitability and continued growth, we expect to meet our longer-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and, as needed, financing arrangements. 
 Credit Agreement . On July 29, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as a lender, swingline lender and issuing bank, the lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Lenders ), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides for the Revolving Credit Facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to 1.0 billion. All loans under the Credit Agreement will mature on July 29, 2027 (the Scheduled Maturity Date ). Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow under the Revolving Credit Facility and terminate or reduce the Lenders commitments at any time prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date. 
 We are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the daily amount of the undrawn portion of the revolving commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate per annum of (i) 0.20 if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.0 to 1.0; (ii) 0.225 if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0 but less than 2.0 to 1.0; (iii) 0.25 if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 but less than 3.0 to 1.0; or (iv) 0.275 if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0. 
 Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0 and a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0, stepping down to 3.25 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2024 and 3.0 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2025 and thereafter. 
 Stock Repurchase Plan and Withholding Shares to Cover Taxes. In May 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan allowing for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 programs. Since the initial authorization of the stock repurchase plan, our Board of Directors has amended and extended and authorized new stock repurchase plans from time to time. In August 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1.1 billion of our common stock over a two-year period expiring on August 15, 2024. On July 29, 2024, our Board of Directors increased and extended the stock repurchase plan, such that 1.5 billion is available for repurchases through August 15, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, there was 1.49 billion available for repurchases under our stock repurchase plan. Our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased depends on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, shares withheld for taxes associated with the vesting of equity incentive awards and other corporate considerations. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 892,669 shares of our common stock at an average cost of 153.70 per share, including 80,464 shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for certain employees upon the vesting of equity incentive awards. Our payment of the taxes on behalf of those employees resulted in an aggregate cash expenditure of 14.4 million and, as such, we generally subtract the amounts attributable to such withheld shares from the aggregate amount available for future purchases under our stock repurchase plan. 
 Dividends on Common Stock. In May 2023, our Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy under which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. 
 The following table summarizes dividend activity during 2024.

(1) All unvested equity incentive awards currently outstanding are entitled to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, provided that such dividends or dividend equivalents are withheld by the Company and distributed to the applicable holder upon vesting of the award. Dividends declared, as reported in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity, includes dividends and dividend equivalents payable to holders of unvested equity incentive awards and, as a result, exceeds the amount of total cash dividends paid presented in this column. 

On October 28, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.375 per share of common stock payable on December 9, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 25, 2024. 
 The declaration, timing and amount of each quarterly cash dividend are subject to the approval of the Board of Directors, including a determination that the dividend policy and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with applicable law. The Board of Directors retains the power to modify, suspend, or cancel the dividend policy in any manner and at any time that it may deem necessary or appropriate.

Cash Flow Analysis 
 Our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability, implementation revenues received but deferred, our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth, and research and development. Our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations. Failure to generate sufficient revenues and related cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives. 
 As our business grows, we expect our capital expenditures related to research and development and other strategic expansion activities to continue to increase. We completed an expansion of our corporate headquarters, which was placed into service in the second quarter of 2024. We anticipate that our capital expenditures in 2024 will be generally consistent with the prior year on a total dollar basis. Depending on certain growth opportunities, we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing, acquisitions, technology and services. Actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our future revenues, cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business. In addition, we purchased the naming rights to the downtown Oklahoma City arena that is home to the Oklahoma City Thunder National Basketball Association franchise. Under the terms of the naming rights agreement, we committed to make payments escalating annually from 4.0 million in 2021 to 6.1 million in 2035. The payments are due in the fourth quarter of each year. Upon the conclusion of the initial term, the agreement may be extended upon the mutual agreement of both parties for an additional five-year period. 
 As part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services, we collect funds from our clients for employment taxes, which we remit to the appropriate tax agencies. We typically invest these funds in money market funds, demand deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and U.S. treasury securities from which we earn interest income during the period between receipt and disbursement of such funds. 
 Our cash flows from investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients payroll calendars and, therefore, such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing of each payroll cycle. 
 Our cash flows from financing activities are also affected by the extent to which we use available cash to purchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan as well as equity incentive award vesting events that result in net share settlements and the Company paying withholding taxes on behalf of certain employees. Additionally, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend, subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 
 The following table summarizes the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of payments received from our clients and interest earned on funds held for clients. Cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of personnel-related expenditures to support the growth and infrastructure of our business. These payments included costs of operations, advertising and other sales and marketing efforts, IT infrastructure development, product research and development and security and administrative costs. Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were positively impacted by changes in working capital. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable prior year period due to a 175.0 million increase in proceeds from investments from funds held for clients and a 0.1 million decrease in purchases of investments from funds held for clients, which were partially offset by a 5.8 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and a 0.1 million decrease in proceeds from sale of property and equipment. 
 27 

Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable prior year period due to the impact of a 582.4 million change related to the client funds obligation, which is due to the timing of receipts from our clients and payments made to our clients employees and applicable taxing authorities on their behalf, a 47.8 million increase in repurchases of common stock, a 20.3 million increase in dividends paid and a 1.8 million increase in withholding taxes paid related to net share settlements. The increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a 0.6 million decrease in payment of debt issuance costs. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Our principal commitments primarily consist of leases for office space and the naming rights agreement. For additional information regarding our naming rights agreement, leases, and our commitments and contingencies, see Note 4. Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net , Note 5. Leases and Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies in the Form 10-K and Note 5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net and Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions to ensure that management believes them to be reasonable under the then-current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions. 
 Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates, and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position, are discussed in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Form 10-K. 
 28 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Management uses adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income as supplemental measures to review and assess the performance of our core business operations and for planning purposes. We define (i) adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations (if any) and any loss on the extinguishment of debt and (ii) non-GAAP net income as net income plus non-cash stock-based compensation expense, certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations (if any) and any loss on the extinguishment of debt, all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are metrics that provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. We believe these metrics are useful to investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a consistent basis, as well as comparisons with the results of peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement results under U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted EBITDA is a measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for reinvestment in our business, paying dividends, repurchasing common stock and other purposes. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in this Form 10-Q, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are not measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP net income in isolation, or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated statements of comprehensive income data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do. 
 The following tables reconcile net income to adjusted EBITDA, net income to non-GAAP net income and earnings per share to non-GAAP net income per share on a basic and diluted basis:

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had corporate cash and cash equivalents totaling 325.8 million and funds held for clients cash and cash equivalents totaling 1.4 billion. These amounts are invested primarily in demand deposit accounts and money market funds. We consider all highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or less and SEC-registered money market mutual funds to be cash equivalents. Additionally, we had available-for-sale securities totaling 24.9 million included within funds held for clients on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. Our available-for-sale securities consisted of a U.S. treasury security with an original maturity of two years. The primary objectives of our investing activities are capital preservation, meeting our liquidity needs and, with respect to investing client funds, generating interest income while maintaining the safety of principal. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Our investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. The market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. We classify all debt securities as available-for-sale and, as a result, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates until such securities are sold or decreases in fair value are determined to be nonrecoverable. To date, we have not recorded any credit impairment losses on our portfolio. 
 As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an approximately 22.9 million increase or decrease, respectively, in interest earned on funds held for clients over the ensuing 12-month period. Interest earned on funds held for clients is included in recurring revenues in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. There are no incremental costs of revenue associated with changes in interest earned on funds held for clients. 
 An immediate increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in a 0.1 million reduction in the aggregate market value of our U.S. treasury security as of September 30, 2024. An immediate decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in a 0.1 million increase in the aggregate market value of our U.S. treasury security as of September 30, 2024. These estimates are based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of September 30, 2024, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in this Form 10-Q is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 We believe, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
 OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are involved in various disputes, claims, suits, investigations and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings of the Form 10-K includes a discussion of legal proceedings. There have been no material changes from the information set forth in Item 3. Legal Proceedings of the Form 10-K. We believe that the resolution of current pending legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Nonetheless, we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, as legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision shall not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee s recommendation or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation.

 16

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, have reasonable cause to believe that the person s conduct was unlawful. 
 Section 6.02. Actions by or in the Right of the Corporation . The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, indemnify and hold harmless any person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer, against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys fees and related disbursements, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties under ERISA, and any other penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. 
 Section 6.03. Indemnification Against Expenses . To the extent that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 6.01 and 6.02 hereof, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.

Any indemnification under Sections 6.01 and 6.02 hereof (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director or officer is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 6.01 and 6.02 hereof. Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination: (a) by a majority vote of the directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum; (b) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum; (c) if there are no such disinterested directors, by independent counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors; or (d) by the stockholders.

Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an officer or director of the Corporation or, subject to Section 6.08 hereof, by an employee or agent of the Corporation, in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized by law or in this Section. Such expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents of the Corporation or persons 
 17 

serving at the request of the Corporation as directors, officers, employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate.

 Section 6.08. Other Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses . The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors or by the Chief Executive Officer, grant rights to indemnification and rights to advancement of expenses to any current or former employee or agent of the Corporation with the same or lesser scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, current and former directors and officers of the Corporation.

For purposes of this Article VI, (a) references to the Corporation shall include, in addition to the Corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VI with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued; (b) references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; (c) references to serving at the request of the Corporation shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to any employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and (d) a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation.
