 Executive Summary 
 
 Overview. The Bank s financial condition and results of operations are influenced by global and national economies, local economies within its three-state district, and the conditions in the financial, housing and credit markets, all of which impact the interest rate environment. 
 
 The interest rate environment significantly impacts the Bank s profitability. Net interest income is affected by several external factors, including market interest rate levels and volatility, credit spreads and the general state of the economy. To 
 1 

manage interest rate risk in connection with advances and debt, the Bank executes interest-rate derivatives. Short-term interest rates also directly affect the Bank s earnings on invested capital. Finally, the Bank s mortgage-related assets make it sensitive to changes in mortgage rates. The Bank earns relatively narrow spreads between yields on assets (particularly advances, its largest asset) and the rates paid on corresponding liabilities. 
 
 The Bank s earnings are affected not only by rising or falling interest rates but also by the particular path and volatility of changes in market interest rates and the prevailing shape of the yield curve. The flattening of the yield curve tends to compress the Bank s net interest margin, while steepening of the curve offers better opportunities to purchase assets with wider net interest spreads. The performance of the Bank s mortgage asset portfolios is particularly affected by shifts in the 10-year maturity range of the yield curve, which is the point that heavily influences mortgage rates and potential refinancings. Yield curve shape can also influence the pace at which borrowers refinance or prepay their existing loans, as borrowers may select shorter-duration mortgage products. 
 
 U.S. Treasury yields declined across all term points in the third quarter due to weaker economic data and a continued decline in inflation, causing the Federal Reserve to adjust policy. After holding the target range for federal funds constant at its July meeting, the Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds target range from 5.25-5.50 to 4.75-5.00 in September, a relatively sizeable decrease. Uncertainty surrounding the size and pace of rate cuts will continue to be a dominant theme, but certain Federal Reserve officials have signaled that additional rate decreases may be appropriate in 2024. The speed and degree of future decreases, if any, could negatively impact the Bank s results of operations particularly if the yield curve also flattens resulting in compressions to net interest margin. FHLBank debt remained relatively close to the U.S. Treasury yields during the quarter. 
 
 Results of Operations . The Bank s net income for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 134.4 million, compared to 156.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The 21.7 million decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noninterest income. The decrease in noninterest income was due primarily to valuation changes in the Bank s derivative and trading securities portfolios resulting from declining interest rates in the third quarter of 2024 compared to interest rate increases in the same prior year period, partially offset by higher letter of credit fees earned. The net interest margin was 69 basis points in the third quarter of 2024, unchanged from the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank s net income totaled 437.6 million, compared to 455.1 million for the same prior-year period. The 17.5 million decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noninterest income. The decrease in noninterest income was due primarily to valuation changes in the Bank s derivative and trading securities portfolio s resulting from declining interest rates in the third quarter of 2024, compared to interest rate increases in the same prior year period, partially offset by higher letter of credit fees earned. The net interest margin was 71 basis points for the first nine months of 2024 and 66 basis points for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to higher net interest spreads with higher spread MBS comprising a larger portion of the Bank s total assets as well as the impact that the higher year to date average short-term interest rates had on non-interest bearing funds. 
 
 In addition to statutory Affordable Housing Program (AHP) assessments under the FHLBank Act, the FHLBanks have stated in their public comment letter to the Finance Agency that they are either already making or will make voluntary contributions of 5 of earnings in support of community investment activities. In 2024, the Bank will continue to make voluntary contributions equal to 5 of prior year s pre-assessment net income to its increasing suite of voluntary community investment products. For additional information on the Bank s Community Investment Products, refer to Community Investment Products in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Financial Condition. Advances. Advances totaled 79.3 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 78.4 billion at December 31, 2023. In addition, the par value of advances that had a remaining maturity of more than one year decreased to 25 at September 30, 2024 compared to 41 at December 31, 2023. Member demand for advances continues to be primarily driven by members liquidity management practices and sustained competition for deposits. Although advance levels remained relatively flat, it is not uncommon for FHLBank to experience fluctuations in the overall advance portfolio driven primarily by changes in member needs. 
 
 The ability to grow and/or maintain the advance portfolio is affected by, among other things, the following: (1) the liquidity demands of the Bank s borrowers; (2) the composition of the Bank s membership; (3) members regulatory requirements; (4) current and future credit market conditions; (5) housing market trends; (6) the shape of the yield curve; and (7) advance pricing. 
 
 Liquidity Investments. The Bank maintains liquidity to meet member borrowing needs and regulatory standards. The liquidity investment portfolio is comprised of cash, interest-bearing deposits, Federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and U.S. Treasury obligations classified as trading or available-for-sale (AFS). At September 30, 2024, the 
 2 

Bank held 15.6 billion of liquid assets compared to 15.3 billion at December 31, 2023. Liquid assets stayed relatively flat as a result of normal portfolio management and liquidity needs. 
 
 Investments. The Bank s investment portfolio, excluding those investments included in the liquidity portfolio, is comprised of trading, AFS and held-to-maturity (HTM) investments. The investments must meet the Bank s risk guidelines and certain other requirements, such as yield . The Bank s investment portfolio totaled 15.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and 12.7 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 2.6 billion. During the first nine months of 2024, the Bank was able to grow its MBS portfolio due to continued capacity under regulatory requirements and attractive mortgage spreads. 
 
 Consolidated Obligations. The Bank s consolidated obligations totaled 108.3 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.8 billion from December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, bonds represented 91 of the Bank s consolidated obligations, compared with 87 at December 31, 2023. Discount notes represented 9 of the Bank s consolidated obligations at September 30, 2024 compared with 13 at year-end 2023. The overall increase in consolidated obligations outstanding is consistent with the increase in asset balances. The funding mix shifted towards floating rate bonds that replaced maturing discount notes and fixed rate bonds. 
 
 Capital Position and Regulatory Requirements . Total capital at September 30, 2024 was 6.0 billion, compared to 5.7 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher retained earnings. Total retained earnings at September 30, 2024 were 2.0 billion, compared with 1.8 billion at December 31, 2023. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) was (5.1) million at September 30, 2024, compared with (72.5) million at December 31, 2023. The change was driven by increases in the fair values of securities within the AFS portfolio. 
 
 In October 2024, the Bank paid quarterly dividends of 9.00 annualized on activity stock and 5.60 annualized on membership stock. These dividends are calculated on stockholders average balances for the third quarter of 2024. For additional information on quarterly dividends, see Note 7 - Capital in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 The dividend rates demonstrate that the Bank continues to return value to its member shareholders. Looking forward, market and business conditions, including strategic initiatives, can impact the Bank s overall performance, as well as the levels of future dividends. The Bank s intent is to continue to provide meaningful shareholder return; future dividend rates may not correspond directly with the pace or direction of interest rate changes. 
 
 The Bank met all of its capital requirements as of September 30, 2024, and in the Finance Agency s most recent determination, as of June 30, 2024, the Bank was deemed "adequately capitalized." 

Earnings Performance 
 
 The following is a summary of the Bank s earnings performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which should be read in conjunction with the Bank s unaudited interim financial statements included in this Form 10-Q as well as the audited financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 

Summary of Financial Results 
 
 Net Income and Return on Average Equity. 
 
 The Bank s net income totaled 134.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 156.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The 21.7 million decrease in net income was driven primarily by the following: 
 Net interest income was 195.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 6.0 million from 189.3 million during the same prior-year period. 
 Interest income was 1,586.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1,500.3 million in the same prior-year period. This increase was driven by higher earnings on MBS due to growth in the portfolio and higher short-term interest rates. 
 Interest expense was 1,391.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1,311.0 million in the same prior-year period. This increase was the result of higher short-term interest rates and higher average consolidated obligations. 
 3 

Noninterest income (loss) was (3.7) million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 14.0 million in the same prior-year period. This 17.7 million decrease was due primarily to valuation changes in the Bank s derivative and trading securities portfolios resulting from declining interest rates in the third quarter of 2024, compared to interest rate increases in the same prior-year period, partially offset by higher letter of credit fees earned. 
 Other expenses, excluding voluntary contributions, was 32.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 27.9 million in the same prior-year period, an increase of 4.7 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits from higher headcount, higher costs associated with technology and other strategic initiatives, and higher assessed expenses from the Finance Agency and the Office of Finance. 
 Voluntary contributions, in support of the Bank s commitment to contribute 5 of prior year s earnings to community investment products, were 10.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to none in the same prior-year period. This increase was driven by the timing of the contributions to voluntary community investment products. 
 The Bank allocated 15.0 million to statutory AHP as a result of third quarter 2024 performance. 
 
 The Bank s net income totaled 437.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 455.1 million for the same prior-year period. The 17.5 million decrease in net income was driven primarily by the following: 
 Net interest income was 588.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 41.4 million from 546.7 million during the same prior-year period. 
 Interest income was 4,641.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4,295.6 million in the same prior-year period. This increase was driven by higher earnings on MBS due to growth in the portfolio and higher short-term interest rates. 
 Interest expense was 4,053.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,748.9 million in the same prior-year period. This increase was the result of higher short-term interest rates. 
 Noninterest income was 21.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 44.8 million in the same prior-year period. This 23.1 million decrease was due primarily to valuation changes in the Bank s derivative and trading securities portfolios resulting from declining interest rates in the third quarter of 2024, compared to interest rate increases in the same prior-year period, partially offset by higher letter of credit fees earned. 
 Other expenses, excluding voluntary contributions, was 94.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 81.6 million in the same prior-year period, an increase of 13.2 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits from higher headcount and market value changes of deferred compensation agreements, costs associated with technology and other strategic initiatives, and higher assessed expenses from the Finance Agency and the Office of Finance. 
 Voluntary contributions, in support of the Bank s commitment to contribute 5 of prior year s earnings to community investment products, were 27.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to none in the same prior-year period. This increase was driven by the timing of the contributions to voluntary community investment products. 
 The Bank allocated 48.8 million to statutory AHP as a result of performance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Bank s return on average equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.41 and 10.47 . The Bank s return on average equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 11.44 and 11.14 .

 Notes: 
 (1) Average balances of deposits (assets and liabilities) include cash collateral received from/paid to counterparties which is reflected in the Statements of Condition as derivative assets/liabilities. 
 (2) Investment securities include trading, AFS and HTM securities. The average balances of AFS and HTM are reflected at amortized cost. 
 (3) Interest on Advances includes prepayment fees, net of 6.5 million and 0.1 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 (4) Nonaccrual mortgage loans are included in average balances in determining the average rate. 
 (5) Net interest margin is net interest income before provision (reversal) for credit losses as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. 
 
 The Bank s business model is designed to protect the net interest spread earned by the Bank and withstand fluctuations in both the level of interest rates and volume of business. Net interest spread increased in the third quarter of 2024 to 41 basis points compared to 39 basis points over the same prior year period. This was primarily due to the Bank s increased investment in comparatively higher net spread MBS now making up a larger portion of total assets accompanied with lower average advance balances. 
 
 Net interest spread also increased in the first nine months of 2024 to 41 basis points compared to 38 basis points over the same prior year period. Higher net spread MBS now comprise a larger percentage of the balance sheet due to growth in the portfolio and a reduction in average advances from the same prior year period. 
 
 Overall, net interest margin was consistent at 69 basis points for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 69 basis points in the third quarter of 2023. The Bank s net interest margin increased by 5 basis points to 71 basis points during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 66 basis points during first nine months of 2023. The increases were due to increased net interest spread and increased earnings on capital from higher average short-term interest rates.

 Notes: 
 (1) Volume changes are calculated as the change in volume multiplied by the prior year rate. 
 (2) Rate changes are calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the prior year average balance. 
 (3) Changes that are not identifiable as either volume-related or rate-related, but rather are equally attributable to both volumes and rates, have been allocated to the volume and rate categories based upon the proportion of the absolute value of the volume and rate changes. 
 
 Interest income increased in both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter comparisons. The increase was driven by higher yields earned on all asset classes from an increase in short-term interest rates and higher earnings on MBS due to growth in the portfolio. 
 
 Interest expense increased in both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter comparisons, driven by higher rates paid on consolidated obligations brought on by increases in short-term interest rates and, in the case of the quarter-over-quarter comparison, higher average consolidated obligations.

Derivative Effects on Net Interest Income. The following tables quantify the effects of the Bank s derivative activities on net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions) Advances Investments Mortgage Loans Bonds Discount Notes Total Amortization/accretion of hedging activities in net interest income 0.1 (0.1) Gains (losses) on designated fair value hedges (2.9) 0.2 (2.7) Other - price alignment amount on cleared derivatives

 The Bank generally uses interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of fixed rate assets and fixed rate bonds which convert the interest rates on those instruments from a fixed rate to a variable rate. The purpose of this strategy is to protect the net interest spread against adverse interest rate changes. Using derivatives to convert interest rates from fixed to variable can increase or decrease net interest income. The variances in the derivative impacts from period to period are driven by the change in the average variable rate, the timing of interest rate resets and the average hedged portfolio balances outstanding during any given 
 8 

period. The Bank uses derivatives to hedge the fair market value changes attributable to the change in the benchmark interest rates. 
 
 In addition, the Bank uses many different funding and hedging strategies. These strategies involve closely match-funding bullet advances with bullet debt. This is designed in part to avoid the use of derivatives where prudent and reduce the Bank s reliance on short-term funding. 
 
 Provision (reversal) for Credit Losses. The provision (reversal) for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 was (0.8) million compared with a provision of 1.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses was 1.1 million and 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The reversal for the third quarter of 2024 was driven by higher market values on the Bank s private label MBS classified as AFS. The provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by private label MBS classified as AFS due to slower actual prepayment speeds and a decline in market values. The provisions for both the third quarter of 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were driven by private label MBS classified as AFS due to declines in market values. 

Noninterest Income 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net gains (losses) on investment securities 4.3 (2.4) 3.3 (1.1) Net gains (losses) on derivatives (17.9) 7.3 (10.6) 21.2 Standby letters of credit fees 8.8 8.1 25.7 22.2 Other, net 1.1 1.0 3.3 2.5 Total noninterest income (loss) (3.7) 14.0 21.7 44.8 
 
 The Bank s change in total noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period was due primarily to valuation changes in the Bank s derivative and trading securities portfolios resulting from declining interest rates in the third quarter of 2024, compared to interest rate increases in the same prior year period, partially offset by higher letter of credit fees earned. 

Derivatives and Hedging Activities. The Bank enters into interest rate swaps, to-be-announced MBS (TBAs), interest rate caps and floors and swaption agreements, all of which are referred to as derivatives transactions. The Bank enters into derivatives transactions to offset all or portions of the financial risk exposures inherent in its member lending, investment and funding activities. Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in derivatives fair values are recorded in the Statements of Income. 
 
 Economic hedges address specific risks inherent in the Bank s balance sheet, but either they do not qualify for hedge accounting or the Bank does not elect to apply hedge accounting. As a result, income recognition on the derivatives in economic hedges may vary considerably compared to the timing of income recognition on the underlying asset or liability. The Bank does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes nor does it have any cash flow hedges. 
 
 Regardless of the hedge strategy employed, the Bank s predominant hedging instrument is an interest rate swap. At the time of inception, the fair market value of an interest rate swap generally equals or is close to zero. Notwithstanding the exchange of interest payments made during the life of the swap, which are recorded as either interest income/expense or as a gain (loss) on derivatives, depending upon the accounting classification of the hedging instrument, the fair value of an interest rate swap returns to zero at the end of its contractual term. Therefore, although the fair value of an interest rate swap is likely to change over the course of its full term, upon maturity any unrealized gains and losses generally net to zero.

The following tables detail the net effect of economic derivatives on noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024

 Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting. For derivatives not receiving hedge accounting (i.e., economic hedges and mortgage delivery commitments), the Bank includes the net interest settlements and the fair value changes in the Net gains (losses) on derivatives financial statement line item. For economic hedges, the Bank recorded net losses of (17.8) million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to net gains of 7.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The net losses observed during the third quarter of 2024 were primarily due to a decrease in market value on the Bank s asset swaps, partially offset by gains on the Bank s liability swaps, resulting from a decrease in rates in the third quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank recorded net losses of (9.3) million compared to net gains of 22.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net losses observed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to a decrease in market value on the Bank s asset swaps, partially offset by gains on the Bank s liability swaps, resulting from a decrease in rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The total notional amount of economic hedges, which includes mortgage delivery commitments was 4.8 billion at September 30, 2024 and 4.2 billion at December 31, 2023.

 The Bank s total other expense increased 15.1 million to 43.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with the same prior-year period. This increase was driven by voluntary contributions, higher compensation and benefits from higher headcount, higher costs associated with technology and other strategic initiatives, and higher assessed expenses from the Finance Agency and the Office of Finance. Voluntary contributions, in support of the Bank s commitment to contribute 5 of prior year s earnings to community investment products, were 10.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to none in the same prior year period. This increase was driven by the timing of the contributions to voluntary community investment products. 
 
 The Bank s total other expense increased 40.7 million to 122.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same prior-year period. This increase was driven by voluntary contributions, higher compensation and benefits from higher headcount and market value changes of deferred compensation agreements, costs associated with technology and other strategic initiatives, and higher assessed expenses from the Finance Agency and the Office of Finance. Voluntary contributions, in support of the Bank s commitment to contribute 5 of prior year s earnings to community investment products, were 27.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to none in the same prior year period. This increase was driven by the timing of the contributions to voluntary community investment products. 

Financial Condition 
 
 The following should be read in conjunction with the Bank s unaudited interim financial statements in this Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 

Assets 
 
 Total assets were 116.0 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 112.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase of 3.9 billion was primarily due to growth in the MBS portfolio. Advances totaled 79.3 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 78.4 billion at December 31, 2023. The Bank s return on average assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 0.47 and 0.56 , respectively. The Bank s return on average assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 0.52 and 0.54 , respectively. 
 
 The Bank s core mission activities include the issuance of advances and acquiring member assets through the MPF Program. Mortgage Partnership Finance and MPF are registered trademarks of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. The core mission asset ratio, defined as the ratio of par amount of advances and MPF loans relative to consolidated obligations adjusted for certain U.S. Treasury securities using nine-month averages, was 78.3 as of September 30, 2024 and 82.6 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in this ratio is primarily due to lower average advance balances. 
 
 Advances. Advances (par) totaled 79.3 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 78.6 billion at December 31, 2023. Member demand for advances continues to be driven primarily by members liquidity management practices, and sustained competition for deposits. Although advance levels remained flat, it is not uncommon for the Bank to experience variances in the overall advance portfolio driven primarily by changes in member needs. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had advances to 150 borrowing members, compared to 161 borrowing members at December 31, 2023. Advances outstanding to the Bank s five largest borrowers totaled 80.8 of total advances as of September 30, 2024, and 79.3 at December 31, 2023. Fixed rate advances with a balance of 24.0 billion comprised 30.3 of the total par value of advances outstanding at September 30, 2024 compared to 30.2 billion comprising 38.3 at December 31, 2023.

 See the Credit and Counterparty Risk - TCE and Collateral discussion in the Risk Management section of this Item 2 for further information on collateral policies and practices and details regarding eligible collateral, including amounts and percentages of eligible collateral securing member advances as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) - Advances. The Bank evaluates its advances for an allowance for credit losses on a collective, or pooled, basis unless an individual assessment is deemed necessary because the instruments do not possess similar risk characteristics. The Bank pools advances by member type. Based on the collateral held as security, the Bank s credit extension and collateral policies and repayment history on advances, including that the Bank has not incurred any credit losses since inception, the Bank has not recorded an ACL at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. For additional information on the allowance methodology, see Note 3 - Advances in this Form 10-Q. 

Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio, Net. Mortgage loans held for portfolio, net of ACL, was 4.7 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Bank places conventional mortgage loans that are 90 days or more delinquent on nonaccrual status. In addition, the Bank records cash payments received as a reduction of principal until the remaining principal amount due is expected to be collected and then as a recovery of any charge-off, if applicable, followed by the recording of interest income. However, government mortgage loans that are 90 days or more delinquent remain in accrual status due to government guarantees or insurance. The Bank may provide a loan modification to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Performing loan modifications are not placed on nonaccrual status. 
 
 Foregone interest represents income the Bank would have recorded if the loan was paying according to its contractual terms. Foregone interest was immaterial for the Bank s mortgage loans for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 13 

The Bank continues to accrue interest on its government-insured or -guaranteed mortgage loans after becoming 90 days or more delinquent. The amount of mortgage loans 90 days or more delinquent and still accruing interest was 2.3 million and 2.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The performance of the mortgage loans in the Bank s MPF Program improved slightly compared to December 31, 2023, and the MPF Original portfolio continues to outperform the market based on national delinquency statistics. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s seriously delinquent mortgage loans (90 days or more delinquent or in the process of foreclosure) represented 0.3 of the MPF Original portfolio, 0.9 of the MPF Plus portfolio, and 0.5 of the MPF 35 portfolio, compared with 0.3 , 1.3 , and 0.5 , respectively, at December 31, 2023. 
 
 ACL - Conventional MPF. The Bank s conventional mortgage loan portfolio is comprised of large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans made to borrowers of participating financial institutions (PFIs) that are secured by residential real estate. Expected credit losses are evaluated based on either an individual or collective assessment of the loans, depending on whether the loans share similar risk characteristics. The Bank purchases government-guaranteed and/or insured and conventional fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. Because the credit risk on the government-guaranteed/insured loans is predominantly assumed by other entities, only conventional mortgage loans are evaluated for an ACL. 
 
 The Bank determines its ACL through consideration of various loan portfolio and collateral-related characteristics, including past performance, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. To estimate credit losses, the Bank uses a third-party model which incorporates certain assumptions, including forecasted housing prices and interest rates, as well as historical borrower behavior experience. The estimate of the expected credit losses includes coverage of certain losses by primary mortgage insurance (PMI), if applicable. The Bank may incorporate a qualitative adjustment to the model results, if deemed appropriate, based on current market conditions or results. For loans determined to be collateral dependent, the Bank charges-off the estimated credit loss against the reserve. However, if the estimated loss can be recovered through credit enhancement (CE), a receivable is established, resulting in a net charge-off. The expected credit loss of a collateral dependent mortgage loan to determine the charge-off is equal to the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less selling costs. 
 
 The Bank recognizes a recovery when expected credit losses, including credit losses charged-off for collateral dependent loans, are less than the amounts previously charged-off. Expected recoveries of prior charge-offs, if any, are included as a reduction to the ACL through the Bank s provision (reversal) for credit losses. The reduction to the ACL is partially offset by a reversal of expected CE, resulting in a net impact to the Bank s provision (reversal) for credit losses. 
 
 The Bank s conventional MPF loans held for portfolio are required to be credit enhanced as determined through the use of a validated model so the risk of loss is limited to the losses within the Bank s risk tolerance. Credit losses on a mortgage loan may only be absorbed by the CE amount in the master commitment related to the loan. In addition, the CE structure of the MPF Program is designed such that initial losses on mortgage loans are incurred by the Bank up to an agreed upon amount, referred to as the First Loss Account (FLA). Additional eligible credit losses are covered by CE provided by PFIs (available CE) until exhausted. Certain losses incurred by the Bank on MPF 35 and MPF Plus can be recaptured by withholding fees paid to the PFI for its retention of credit risk. All additional losses are incurred by the Bank. 
 
 The following table presents the balance of the MPF CE structure at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in millions) FLA Available CE FLA Available CE MPF Original 9.1 76.6 8.6 75.5 MPF 35 19.7 124.7 18.8 135.5 MPF Plus 14.9 0.9 14.9 1.1 Total 43.7 202.2 42.3 212.1

 Note: 
 (1) Net charge-offs that the Bank does not expect to recover through CE receivable. 
 
 The ACL on mortgage loans decreased by 0.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Changes in the ACL are typically not significant, as expected credit losses are reduced by the CE available to absorb losses on the loans in accordance with the credit structure of the MPF Program.

Cash and Investments. The Bank s strategy is to maintain its short-term liquidity position in part to be able to meet members advance demand and Bank regulatory liquidity requirements. Excess cash is typically invested in overnight investments. The Bank also maintains an investment portfolio to enhance earnings. These investments may be classified as trading, AFS or HTM. 
 
 The Bank maintains a liquidity portfolio comprised of cash, interest-bearing deposits, Federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and U.S. Treasury obligations classified as trading or AFS. The liquidity portfolio totaled 15.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and 15.3 billion at December 31, 2023 an increase of 0.3 billion. 
 
 The Bank s investment portfolio, excluding those investments included in the liquidity portfolio, is comprised of trading, AFS and HTM investments. The investments must meet the Bank s risk guidelines and certain other requirements, such as yield. The Bank s investment portfolio totaled 15.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and 12.7 billion at December 31, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, the Bank was able to grow its MBS portfolio due to the combination of continued capacity under regulatory requirements and continued attractive mortgage spreads. 
 
 Investment securities, defined as all trading, AFS, and HTM securities, totaled 19.4 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 16.4 billion at December 31, 2023. Details of the investment securities portfolio follow.

For additional information on the credit risk of the investment portfolio, see the Credit and Counterparty Risk - Investments discussion in the Risk Management section of this Item 2. 
 
 ACL - Investments. The Bank invests in interest-bearing deposits and Federal funds sold which are unsecured investments. The Bank also invests in securities purchased under agreements to resell which are secured investments. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these investments were repaid according to the contractual terms. No ACL was recorded for these assets at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 AFS securities are evaluated quarterly for expected credit losses on an individual security basis. In assessing whether a credit loss exists, the Bank considers whether there would be a shortfall in receiving all cash flows contractually due. The allowance is limited to the amount of the AFS security s unrealized loss, if any. If the AFS security is in an unrealized gain, the ACL is zero. The ACL on AFS private label MBS was 13.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 12.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in the ACL was driven primarily by private label MBS classified as AFS due to slower actual prepayments and a decline in market values. 
 
 HTM securities are evaluated quarterly for expected credit losses on a pool basis unless an individual assessment is deemed necessary because the securities do not possess similar risk characteristics. An ACL is recorded with a corresponding adjustment to the provision (reversal) for credit losses. There was no ACL at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 For additional information on the allowance methodology, see Note 2 - Investments in this Form 10-Q. 

Liabilities and Capital 
 
 Deposits. The Bank offers demand, overnight and term deposits for members and qualifying nonmembers. Total deposits at September 30, 2024 increased to 704.9 million from 636.7 million at December 31, 2023. All of the Bank s deposits are uninsured. 
 
 Consolidated Obligations. Consolidated obligations consist of bonds and discount notes. The Bank s consolidated obligations totaled 108.3 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.8 billion from December 31, 2023. The overall increase in consolidated obligations outstanding is consistent with the increase in asset balances. At September 30, 2024, the Bank s bonds outstanding increased to 98.5 billion compared to 90.8 billion at December 31, 2023. Discount notes outstanding at September 30, 2024 decreased to 9.8 billion from 13.7 billion at December 31, 2023. The funding mix shifted towards floating rate bonds that replaced maturing discount notes and fixed rate bonds. 
 
 The Bank primarily uses noncallable bonds as a source of funding but also utilizes structured notes such as callable bonds. Unswapped callable bonds primarily fund the Bank s mortgage portfolio while swapped callable bonds fund other floating rate assets. 
 
 17 

The following table provides information on consolidated obligations by product type and contractual maturity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Items. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was obligated to fund approximately 21.1 million of mortgage loans and to issue 1.3 billion in consolidated obligations. In addition, the Bank had 30.9 billion in outstanding standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2024. The Bank does not consolidate any off-balance sheet special purpose entities or other off-balance sheet conduits. 
 
 Capital and Retained Earnings. The Bank s return on average equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.41 and 10.47 . The Bank s return on average equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 11.44 and 11.14 . Capital adequacy, including the level of retained earnings, is monitored through the evaluation of market value of equity to par value of capital stock (MV/CS) as well as other risk metrics. Details regarding these metrics are discussed in the Risk Management portion of this Item 2. 
 
 The Bank s capital stock is owned by its members and former members. The concentration of the Bank s capital stock by institution type is presented below. 
 (dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Commercial banks 121 3,495.8 125 3,576.5 Savings institutions 48 167.3 48 157.2 Insurance companies 43 161.9 41 75.3 Credit unions 69 107.1 67 111.2 Community Development Financial Institutions

 The Finance Agency has issued regulatory guidance to the FHLBanks relating to capital management and retained earnings. The guidance directs each FHLBank to assess, at least annually, the adequacy of its retained earnings with consideration given to future possible financial and economic scenarios. The guidance also outlines the considerations that each FHLBank should undertake in assessing the adequacy of its retained earnings. 
 
 19 

The Bank developed a framework for evaluating retained earnings adequacy, consistent with regulatory guidance and requirements. Retained earnings are intended to cover unexpected losses and protect members par value of capital stock. The framework also assists management in its overall analysis of the level of future dividends. The framework includes four risk elements that comprise the Bank s total retained earnings target: (1) market risk; (2) credit risk; (3) operational risk; and (4) accounting risk. The retained earnings target generated from this framework is sensitive to changes in the Bank s risk profile, whether favorable or unfavorable. The framework generated a retained earnings target of 751 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In addition to the retained earnings target, the Bank considers the amount of retained earnings needed for compliance with the regulatory minimum capital-to-asset ratio of 4 to determine an overall retained earnings need. The Bank s overall retained earnings need is 1,615 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The following table presents retained earnings information for the current and prior year. 
 
 (in millions) 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Unrestricted Retained Earnings 1,331.3 1,216.3 Restricted Retained Earnings 
 702.9 615.4 Total Retained Earnings 2,034.2 1,831.7 
 
 Retained earnings increased 202.5 million compared to December 31, 2023. The increase reflected net income that was partially offset by dividends paid. For additional information, see Note 7 - Capital in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Dividends. The Bank declares dividends based on an annualized yield and differentiates between membership and activity capital stock. The dividend received by the member is calculated based on the average capital stock owned by the member for the previous quarter. Historically, the Bank has paid cash dividends although dividends may be paid in capital stock. Details regarding the Bank s payment of dividends, including annual yields, for current and prior year periods are provided in Note 7 - Capital in this Form 10-Q. The following table presents dividend information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Dividends (in millions) 77.8 81.2 235.2 210.3 Dividends per share 2.09 2.16 6.39 5.43 Dividend payout ratio (1)

Capital Resources 
 
 The following should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim financial statements included in this Form 10-Q, the audited financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and the Capital Resources section of Item 1. Business in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Risk-Based Capital (RBC) 
 
 The Finance Agency s RBC regulatory framework requires the Bank to maintain sufficient permanent capital, defined as retained earnings plus capital stock, to meet its combined credit risk, market risk and operations risk. Each of these components is computed as specified in regulations and directives issued by the Finance Agency. 
 (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Permanent capital: Capital stock (1) 
 3,960.0 3,948.4 Retained earnings 
 2,034.2 1,831.7 Total permanent capital 5,994.2 5,780.1 RBC requirement: Credit risk capital 
 223.0 219.3 Market risk capital 
 470.6 356.3 Operations risk capital 
 208.1 172.7 Total RBC requirement 901.7 748.3 Excess permanent capital over RBC requirement 5,092.5 5,031.8 
 Note: 
 (1) Capital stock includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
 
 The increase in the total RBC requirement as of September 30, 2024 reflects higher market risk capital and operational risk requirements. The increase was primarily driven by MBS portfolio growth during the first nine months of 2024 along with mortgage prepayment model changes made during the second quarter. The Bank continues to maintain significant excess permanent capital over the RBC requirement. 
 
 On September 26, 2024, the Bank received final notification from the Finance Agency that it was considered adequately capitalized for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. As of the date of this filing, the Bank has not received final notice from the Finance Agency regarding its capital classification for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The Bank s financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies used by the Bank. In addition, the Bank s critical accounting policies and estimates are presented in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. Certain of these policies require management to make estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect the Bank s reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. Management views these policies as critical accounting policies. 
 
 The Bank made no changes to its critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 See Note 1 - Changes in Accounting Principle and Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Interpretations to the unaudited financial statements in this Form 10-Q for information on new accounting pronouncements impacting the financial statements or becoming effective for the Bank in future periods.

Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 
 Certain legislative and regulatory actions and developments are summarized in this section. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Legislative and Regulatory Developments in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K and in the Bank s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, for a description of certain legislative and regulatory developments that occurred prior to the publication of those reports. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank Member Credit Risk Management. 
 
 On September 27, 2024, the Finance Agency issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the Finance Agency s expectations that an FHLBank s underwriting and credit decisions should reflect a member s financial condition and not rely solely on the collateral securing the member s credit obligations. The advisory bulletin provides guidance for the FHLBanks to implement policies for credit risk governance, member credit assessment and monitoring of credit conditions, among other considerations. It also provides guidance on the oversight of members in financial distress by recommending implementation of escalation policies, processes for coordination with members prudential regulators, and management policies addressing default, failure, and insolvency situations. The Bank is comparing this advisory bulletin against its current member credit risk management policies and procedures to assess its potential impact on the Bank and its operations. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank System Climate-Related Risk Management. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, the Finance Agency issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the Finance Agency s expectation that each FHLBank should integrate climate-related risk management into its existing enterprise risk management framework over time. The advisory bulletin provides that an effective framework should address climate-related risk governance, such as selection of the related risk appetite and setting strategy and objectives, establishing and implementing plans to mitigate and monitor and report material exposures to such risks, and establishing roles and responsibilities for the board of directors and management. The advisory bulletin requires the FHLBanks to establish metrics that track exposure to climate-related risks and collect related data to quantify risk exposures, conduct climate-related scenario analyses, implement processes to report and communicate climate-related risks to internal stakeholders, and have a plan to respond to natural disasters and support climate resiliency. The Bank is evaluating the potential impact of the advisory bulletin on the Bank and its operations. Some aspects of this advisory bulletin also apply to the Office of Finance, as relevant. 
 
 Proposed Rule on Unsecured Credit Limits for FHLBanks. 
 
 On October 3, 2024, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule with a comment deadline of December 2, 2024 to amend the Finance Agency s regulation on capital requirements (Capital Regulation) to modify unsecured credit limits for FHLBanks. The proposed rule would include interest bearing deposit accounts (IBDAs) in a category of authorized overnight investments that would be excluded from the general limit on unsecured credit to a single counterparty. IBDAs are non-maturity deposits in approved counterparties which may be used to manage liquidity. The proposed rule would, among other things, increase the frequency of the required performance of certain capital calculations and clarify that certain non-interest-bearing deposit accounts (such as settlement, payment or other transactional accounts) are to be considered unsecured extensions of credit subject to the Capital Regulation s unsecured general or overall (less restrictive) limit. Although excluding IBDAs from the general unsecured credit limit could provide greater flexibility for an FHLBank s liquidity management, several of the other proposed changes, if adopted, could result in significant changes to the Bank s current business processes. The Bank is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on the Bank and its operations. 
 
 Proposed Rule on FHLBank System Boards of Directors and Executive Management. 
 
 On October 21, 2024, the Finance Agency proposed revisions to its regulations addressing boards of directors and overall corporate governance of the FHLBanks and the Office of Finance. The comment deadline will be 90 days after the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. If adopted as presented, the proposed rule would, among other things: (1) impact director compensation by allowing the Director of the Finance Agency to establish an annual amount of director compensation that the Director determines is reasonable; (2) require the Bank to complete and submit background checks to the Finance Agency on every nominee for a directorship; (3) impact public interest independent director qualifications, in part by requiring a person to have advocated for, or otherwise acted primarily on behalf of or for the direct benefit of, consumers or the community to meet the representation requirement; (4) expand the list of qualifying experiences for all Bank independent directors to include artificial intelligence, information technology and security, climate-related risk, Community Development Financial Institutions, business models, and modeling; and (5) establish a review process for director performance and participation, together with a process for removing Bank directors for cause. Other proposed revisions address, among other 
 22 

things, Bank conflicts of interest policies, covering all Bank employees, including specific limitations on executive officers and senior management and record retention. 
 
 While some proposed revisions would codify existing guidance and practice, several of the proposed revisions could result in significant changes to the nomination, election and retention of the Bank s board of directors. Additional director eligibility requirements and limitations on and potential reductions or limitations to director compensation resulting from the proposed rule could hinder the Bank s ability to recruit and retain the talent and expertise that are critical to the Bank s ability to satisfy its mission, particularly given the growing complexities of the finance industry. The Bank continues to analyze the impact that the proposed rule could have on the Bank. 
 23 

Risk Management 
 
 The Bank employs a corporate governance and internal control framework designed to support the effective management of the Bank s business activities and the related inherent risks. As part of this framework, the Board has approved a Risk Governance Policy and a Member Products Policy, both of which are reviewed regularly and re-approved at least annually. The Risk Governance Policy establishes risk guidelines, limits (if applicable), and standards for credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, business risk and various forms of operational and technology risk, in accordance with Finance Agency regulations and consistent with the Bank s risk appetite. The Member Products Policy establishes the eligibility and authorization requirements, policy limits and restrictions, and the terms applicable to each type of Bank product or service, as well as collateral requirements. The risk appetite is established by the Board, as are other applicable guidelines in connection with the Bank s Capital Plan and overall risk management. 

Risk Governance 
 
 The Bank s lending, investment and funding and hedging activities expose the Bank to a number of risks that include, market and interest rate risk, credit and counterparty risk, liquidity and funding risk, and operational and business risks. These include risks such as use and reliance on models and end-user computing tools, technology and information security risk, among others. In addition, the Bank s risks are affected by current and projected financial and residential mortgage market trends, including those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. Details regarding the Bank s risk governance framework and processes are included in the "Risk Governance" discussion in Risk Management in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Capital Adequacy Measures . The MV/CS ratio provides a current assessment of the liquidation value of the balance sheet and measures the Bank s current ability to honor the par put redemption feature of its capital stock. This is one of the risk metrics used to evaluate the adequacy of retained earnings, which is used to develop dividend payment recommendations and support the repurchase of excess capital stock. 
 
 The current Board-approved floor for the MV/CS ratio is 90.0 . The MV/CS ratio is measured against the floor monthly. When the MV/CS ratio is below the established floor, excess capital stock repurchases and dividend payouts are restricted. See the Capital and Retained Earnings discussion in Financial Condition in this Item 2 for details regarding the Bank s retained earnings policy. 
 
 The MV/CS ratio was 150.8 at September 30, 2024 and 142.7 at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the growth in retained earnings. 

Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures Regarding Market Risk 
 
 Managing Market Risk . The Bank s market risk management objective is to protect member/shareholder and bondholder value consistent with the Bank s housing mission and safe and sound operations across a wide range of interest rate environments. Management believes that a disciplined approach to market risk management is essential to maintaining a strong capital base and uninterrupted access to the capital markets. 
 
 The Bank s Market Risk Model. Significant resources are devoted to ensuring that the level of market risk in the balance sheet is accurately measured, thus allowing management to monitor the risk against policy and regulatory limits. The Bank uses externally developed models to evaluate its financial position and market risk. One of the most critical market-based models relates to the prepayment of principal on mortgage-related instruments. Management regularly reviews the major assumptions and methodologies used in its models, as well as the performance of the models relative to empirical results, so that appropriate changes to the models can be made. Economic conditions, such as market liquidity and Federal Reserve actions to adjust short-term interest rates, may impact the performance of the Bank s models used to measure market risk. Management considers the impact of current economic conditions on key market risk measures and makes changes as deemed appropriate. 
 
 The Bank regularly validates the models used to measure market risk. Such model validations are performed by the Bank s model risk management department, which is separate from the model owner. These model validations may include third-party specialists when appropriate. The model validations are supplemented by performance monitoring by the model owner which is reported to the Bank s model risk management department. In addition, the Bank benchmarks model-derived fair values to those provided by third-party services or alternative internal valuation models. The benchmarking analysis is performed by a group that is separate from the model owner. Results of the model validations and benchmarking analysis, as well as any 
 24 

changes to the valuation methodologies and inputs, are reported to the Bank s Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) (or subcommittee of), which is responsible for overseeing market risk. 
 
 Duration of Equity. One key risk metric used by the Bank is duration. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a financial instrument's value, or the value of a portfolio of instruments, to a 100 basis point parallel shift in interest rates. Duration (typically expressed in years) is commonly used by investors throughout the fixed income securities market as a measure of financial instrument price sensitivity. During the second quarter of 2024, prepayment model changes were made which decreased projected prepayment speeds and modeled prepayments more closely with actual portfolio experience. 
 
 The Bank s asset/liability management policy approved by the Board calls for actual duration of equity to be maintained within a + 4.5 year range in the base case. In addition, the duration of equity exposure limit in an instantaneous parallel interest rate shock of + 200 basis points is + 7 years. Management analyzes the duration of equity exposure against this policy limit on a daily basis and regularly evaluates its market risk management strategies. 
 
 The following table presents the Bank s duration of equity exposure at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 (in years) Down 200 basis points Down 100 basis points Base Case Up 100 basis points Up 200 basis points Duration of Equity: 
 September 30, 2024 0.3 0.7 1.3 1.6 2.0 December 31, 2023 0.9 0.7 0.7 0.9 1.1 
 
 Duration of equity changes during the first nine months of 2024 were primarily due to the prepayment model changes noted above and decline in interest rates. The Bank regularly monitors the mortgage and related fixed-income markets, including the impact that changes in the market or anticipated modeling changes may have on duration of equity and other market risk measures and may take actions to reduce market risk exposures as needed. 
 
 Return on Equity (ROE) Spread Volatility . Interest rate risk is also measured based on the volatility in the Bank s projected return on capital in excess of the return of an established benchmark market index. ROE spread is defined as the Bank s return on average equity, including capital stock and retained earnings, in excess of the average of the projected Federal funds rate. 
 
 ROE spread volatility is a measure of the variability of the Bank s projected ROE spread in response to shifts in interest rates and represents the change in ROE spread compared to an ROE spread that is generated by the Bank in its base forecasting scenario. ROE spread volatility is measured over a rolling forward 12 month period for selected interest rate scenarios and excludes the income sensitivity resulting from mark-to-market changes, which are separately described below. 
 
 Management uses both parallel and non-parallel rate scenarios to assess interest rate risk. The steeper and flatter yield curve shift scenarios are represented by appropriate increases and decreases in short-term and long-term interest rates using the three-year point on the yield curve as the pivot point. 
 
 ROE Spread Volatility Increase/(Decline) (in basis points) Down 200 bps Parallel Shock Down 100 bps Longer Term Rate Shock 100 bps Steeper 100 bps Flatter Up 200 bps Parallel Shock September 30, 2024 (3) (5) 12 (3) (5) December 31, 2023 (11) 12 (11) 17 11 
 
 The changes in ROE spread volatility at September 30, 2024 as compared with December 31, 2023, primarily reflect the impact of funding mix changes. For each scenario, the Board s limit on the decline in ROE spread is set at no greater than 100 basis points. The Bank was in compliance with the ROE spread volatility limit across all selected interest rate shock scenarios at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Mark-to-Market Risk. The Bank measures earnings risk associated with certain mark-to-market positions, including economic hedges. This framework measures forward-looking, scenario-based exposure based on interest rate and volatility shocks that are applied to any existing transaction that is marked to market through the income statement without an offsetting mark arising from a qualifying hedge relationship. In addition, the Bank s Capital Markets and Corporate Risk Management 
 25 

departments monitor the actual profit/loss change on a daily, monthly cumulative, and quarterly cumulative basis. The Bank s ALCO monitors mark-to-market risk through a daily exposure guideline and quarterly profit/loss reporting trigger. 

Credit and Counterparty Risk - Total Credit Exposure (TCE) and Collateral 
 
 TCE. The Bank manages the credit risk of each member on the basis of the member s total credit exposure (TCE) to the Bank, which includes advances and related accrued interest, fees, basis adjustments and estimated prepayment fees; letters of credit; forward-dated advance commitments; and MPF credit enhancement and related obligations. This credit risk is managed by monitoring the financial condition of borrowers and by requiring all borrowers (and, where applicable in connection with member affiliate pledge arrangements approved by the Bank, their affiliates) to pledge sufficient eligible collateral for all borrower obligations to the Bank as the Bank seeks to cover all potential forms of credit-related exposure with sufficient eligible collateral. At September 30, 2024, aggregate TCE was 112.7 billion, comprised of approximately 79.3 billion in advance principal outstanding, 32.7 billion in letters of credit (including forward commitments), and 0.7 billion in accrued interest, prepayment fees, MPF credit enhancement obligations and other fees. 
 
 The Bank establishes a maximum borrowing capacity (MBC) for each member based on collateral weightings applied to eligible collateral as described in the Bank s Member Products Policy. MBC is limited to a percentage of the members' assets based on the institution size and type subject to a maximum prudential lending limit. Details regarding this policy are available in the Advance Products discussion in Item 1. Business in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. According to the policy, eligible collateral is weighted so that the collateral value is likely to exceed the amount that may be owed to the Bank in the event of a default. The Bank also has the ability to call for additional or substitute collateral while any indebtedness is outstanding to protect the Bank s secured position. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, on a borrower-by-borrower basis, the Bank had a perfected security interest in eligible collateral with an estimated collateral value (after collateral weightings) in excess of the book value of all members and nonmember housing associates obligations to the Bank. 
 
 As part of the assessment of member creditworthiness, the Bank regularly monitors banking system and financial markets for signs of stress, considers events and conditions impacting a member individually or members generally and utilizes qualitative overrides to model internal credit ratings, as appropriate. 
 
 The financial condition of all members and eligible non-member housing associates is closely monitored for compliance with financial criteria as set forth in the Bank s credit policies. The Bank has developed an internal credit rating (ICR) system that calculates financial scores and rates member institutions on a quarterly basis using a numerical rating scale from one to ten, with one being the best rating. The Bank s determination of rating is derived using a holistic credit analysis which incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors. A quantitative scoring system uses financial ratios computed from publicly available data. The scoring system gives the highest weighting to the member s asset quality and capitalization. Other key factors include earnings, liquidity, and balance sheet composition. Operating results which include net income, liquidity levels and liquidity composition, capital levels, reserve coverage and other factors for the previous four quarters are used. The most recent quarter s results are given a higher weighting. Qualitative factors, such as unique business models or characteristics, recent events, and/or regulatory ratings are also considered in determining the ICR. A higher number (i.e., worse) rating indicates that a member exhibits well defined financial weaknesses. Members in these categories are reviewed for potential change to their collateral delivery status, advance tenor restrictions, and potential limitations on access to Bank products. Other uses of the ICR include the scheduling of on-site collateral verification reviews. Insurance company members are also rated on a ten-point scale with the rating based on both quantitative and qualitative factors. While depository institution member analysis uses standardized regulatory call report data and risk modeling, along with qualitative analysis, insurance company credit risk analysis is based on various forms of financial data, including, but not limited to, statutory reporting filed by insurance companies with state insurance regulators, which requires specialized methodologies and dedicated underwriting resources. 
 
 As noted above, t he Bank monitors member credit quality on a regular basis. Management believes that it has adequate policies and procedures in place to effectively manage credit risk exposure related to member TCE. These credit and collateral policies are intended to balance the Bank s dual goals of meeting members needs as a reliable source of liquidity and limiting credit loss by adjusting the credit and collateral terms in response to deterioration in creditworthiness. The Bank has never experienced a loss on its advance exposure.

Outstanding letters of credit totaled 30.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and 28.8 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily related to public unit deposits. Not included in these totals are additional authorized but unused standby letters of credit of 1.8 billion at September 30, 2024 and 1.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The Bank had a concentration of letters of credit with one member (TD Bank) of 19.5 billion or 63 of the total at September 30, 2024 and 19.7 billion or 68 of the total at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Collateral Policies and Practices. All members are required to maintain eligible collateral to secure their TCE in accordance with the Member Products Policy. Refer to the Risk Management section of the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information related to the Bank s Collateral Policy. 
 
 Collateral Agreements and Valuation. The Bank provides members with two types of collateral agreements: a blanket lien collateral pledge agreement and a specific collateral pledge agreement. Under a blanket lien agreement, the Bank obtains a lien against all of the member s unencumbered eligible collateral assets and most ineligible assets to secure the member s obligations with the Bank. Under a specific collateral pledge agreement, the Bank obtains a lien against specific eligible collateral assets of the member or its affiliate (if applicable) to secure the member s obligations with the Bank. The member provides a detailed listing, as an addendum to the specific collateral agreement, identifying those assets pledged as collateral or delivered to the Bank or its third-party custodian. Details regarding average lending values provided under both blanket liens and specific liens and delivery arrangements are available in the "Credit and Counterparty Risk - TCE and Collateral"

 Consistent with previous policy stipulations, high quality investment securities are defined as U.S. Treasury and U.S. Agency securities, REFCORP bonds, GSE MBS, commercial and residential private label MBS with a minimum credit rating of single A-minus, which the Bank considers as part of its evaluation of the collateral. In addition, municipal securities (or portions thereof) with a real estate nexus (e.g., proceeds primarily used for real estate development) with a minimum credit rating of single A-minus are included. Members have the option to deliver such high-quality investment securities to the Bank to increase their maximum borrowing capacity. Upon delivery, these securities are valued daily and all non-government or agency securities are subject to weekly ratings reviews. The reported amount also includes cash that the member has pledged to the Bank for collateral purposes. 
 
 For member borrowers, the following tables present information on a combined basis regarding the type of collateral securing their outstanding credit exposure and the collateral status as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Credit and Counterparty Risk - Investments 
 
 The Bank is also subject to credit risk on investments consisting of money market investments and investment securities. The Bank considers a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, including collateral performance, marketability, asset class or sector considerations, local and regional economic conditions, nationally recognized statistical organization (NRSRO) credit ratings and/or the financial health of the underlying issuer. 
 
 Investment Quality and External Credit Ratings. The following tables present the Bank s investment carrying values as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, based on the lowest credit rating from the NRSROs (Moody s, S P and Fitch).

 29 

The Bank also manages its investments credit risks based on an internal credit rating system. For purposes of determining the internal credit rating, the Bank measures credit exposure through a process which includes internal credit review and various external factors, including NRSRO analysis. The Bank does not rely solely on any NRSRO rating in deriving its final internal credit rating. 
 
 Short-term Investments. Within the portfolio of short-term investments, the Bank faces credit risk from unsecured exposures. The Bank s unsecured investments have maturities generally ranging between overnight and six months and include the following types: 
 
 Interest-bearing deposits. Primarily consists of unsecured deposits that earn interest; and 
 Federal funds sold. Unsecured loans of reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Banks between financial institutions that are made on an overnight and term basis. 
 
 Under the Bank s Risk Governance Policy, the Bank can place money market investments, which include those investment types listed above, on an unsecured basis with large financial institutions with long-term credit ratings no lower than BBB. Management actively monitors the credit quality of these counterparties. The Bank also invests in securities purchased under agreements to resell which are secured investments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had unsecured exposure to ten counterparties totaling 6.7 billion, with five counterparties each exceeding 10 of the total exposure. The following table presents the Bank s unsecured credit exposure with non-governmental counterparties by investment type at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The unsecured investment credit exposure presented may not reflect the average or maximum exposure during the period.

 Note: 
 (1) Excludes 5.6 million of Interest-bearing deposits with FHLBank of Chicago at September 30, 2024 and 6.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 41.7 of the Bank s unsecured investment credit exposures were to U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks. The Bank actively monitors its credit exposures and the credit quality of its counterparties, including an assessment of each counterparty s financial performance, capital adequacy, sovereign support, and the current market perceptions of the counterparties. General macro-economic, political and market conditions may also be considered when deciding on unsecured exposure. As a result, the Bank may limit or suspend existing counterparties. 
 
 Finance Agency regulations include limits on the amount of unsecured credit the Bank may extend to a counterparty or to a group of affiliated counterparties. This limit is based on a percentage of eligible regulatory capital and the counterparty's overall internal credit rating. Under these regulations, the level of eligible regulatory capital is determined as the lesser of the Bank s total regulatory capital or the eligible amount of regulatory capital of the counterparty. The eligible amount of regulatory capital is then multiplied by a stated percentage. This percentage is 1 to 15 and is based on the counterparty's internal credit rating. The calculation of term extensions of unsecured credit includes on-balance sheet transactions, off-balance sheet commitments, and derivative transactions. 
 
 Finance Agency regulation also permits the Bank to extend additional unsecured credit for overnight transactions and for sales of Federal funds subject to continuing contracts that renew automatically. For overnight exposures only, the Bank s total unsecured exposure to a counterparty may not exceed twice the applicable regulatory limit, or a total of 2 to 30 of the eligible amount of regulatory capital, based on the counterparty s internal credit rating. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was in compliance with the regulatory limits established for unsecured credit. 
 
 The Bank s unsecured credit exposures to U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks include the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, the counterparty may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations. The Bank s unsecured credit exposures to domestic counterparties and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign commercial banks include the risk that these counterparties have extended credit to foreign counterparties.

 Notes: 
 (1) Ratings are as of the respective dates. 
 (2) These ratings represent the lowest rating available for each security owned by the Bank based on the NRSROs used by the Bank. The Bank s internal ratings may differ from those obtained from the NRSROs. 
 (3) Excludes unsecured investment credit exposure to U.S. government, U.S. government agencies and instrumentalities, GSEs, and supranational entities. 
 (4) Represents the NRSRO rating of the counterparty not the country. There were no AAA or BBB rated investments at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 U.S. Treasury Obligations. The Bank invests in U.S. Treasury obligations that are explicitly fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. This portfolio totaled 4.2 billion at September 30, 2024 and 3.7 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Agency/GSE Securities and Agency/GSE MBS. The Bank invests in and is subject to credit risk related to securities issued by Federal agencies or U.S. government corporations. In addition, the Bank invests in MBS issued by these same entities that are directly supported by underlying mortgage loans. Both the securities and MBS are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. These portfolios totaled 14.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and 12.4 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 State and Local Agency Obligations. The Bank invests in and is subject to credit risk related to a portfolio of state and local agency obligations (i.e., housing finance agency bonds) that are directly or indirectly supported by underlying mortgage loans. These portfolios totaled 174.3 million at September 30, 2024 and 174.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Private Label MBS. The Bank also holds investments in private label MBS, which are supported by underlying mortgage loans. The Bank made investments in private label MBS that were rated AAA at the time of purchase with the exception of one, which was rated AA. However, since the time of purchase, there have been significant ratings downgrades. In 2007, the Bank discontinued the purchase of private label MBS. The carrying value of the Bank s private label MBS portfolio was 158.1 million at September 30, 2024 and 170.3 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Credit Losses. The Bank evaluates its private label MBS for expected credit losses quarterly, based on whether there is an expectation of a shortfall in receiving all cash flows contractually due. The Bank expects to receive all cash flows contractually due with respect to its HTM private label MBS and therefore has no ACL related to this portfolio. With respect to its AFS private label MBS, the Bank had an ACL of 13.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and 12.0 million as of December 31, 
 31 

2023. For its AFS private label MBS for which the Bank expects a shortfall, an ACL is recorded, limited to the amount of a security's unrealized loss. If the security is in an unrealized gain position, the ACL is zero. 
 
 The Bank recorded a benefit for credit losses of 0.9 million and a provision for credit losses of 1.6 million on its AFS private label MBS for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Bank recorded a provision for credit losses of 1.1 million and 3.0 million for the same prior-year period. Bec ause the Bank does not intend to sell and will not be required to sell its AFS private label MBS with recorded credit losses before anticipated recovery of their amortized cost basis, the Bank did not write down any of its AFS private label MBS securities amortized cost basis for the difference between amortized cost and fair value. 
 
 For those AFS private label MBS with a credit loss previously recorded, when the Bank projects an increase in cash flows during its quarterly assessment of expected credit losses, the Bank will first reverse the ACL by recognizing a reversal for credit losses up to the amount of the ACL, if any. If the Bank projects a significant increase in cash flows, the Bank adjusts the accretable yield prospectively and recognizes the interest income over the remaining lives of the securities. The amount recognized in interest income on these securities was 2.2 million and 2.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 and 6.5 million and 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Credit and Counterparty Risk - Mortgage Loans and Derivatives 
 
 Mortgage Loans. The Finance Agency has authorized the Bank to hold mortgage loans under the MPF Program whereby the Bank acquires mortgage loans from participating members in a shared credit risk structure. Conventional mortgage loans carry CE such that the Bank has a high degree of confidence that it will be paid principal and interest in all material respects, even under reasonably likely adverse changes to expected economic conditions. Loans are assessed by a third-party credit model at acquisition, and a CE is calculated based on loan attributes and the Bank s risk tolerance with respect to its MPF portfolio. The Bank had net mortgage loans held for portfolio of 4.7 billion at September 30, 2024 and 4.7 billion at December 31, 2023, after an allowance for credit losses of 2.4 million at September 30, 2024 and 3.0 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Mortgage Insurers. The Bank s MPF Program currently has credit exposure to ten mortgage insurance companies which provide PMI and/or Supplemental Mortgage Insurance (SMI) for the Bank s various products. To be active, the mortgage insurance company must be approved as a qualified insurer in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. At least every two years, the Bank reviews the qualified insurers to determine if they continue to meet the financial and operational standards set by the Bank. 
 
 When a conventional mortgage loan requires PMI, the MPF Program modeling applied to the Bank s acquisitions requires additional CE from the PFI to compensate for the mortgage insurer rating when it is below BBB+. The unpaid principal balance and maximum coverage outstanding for seriously delinquent loans with PMI as of September 30, 2024 was 7.9 million and 2.3 million, respectively. The corresponding amounts at December 31, 2023 were 8.5 million and 2.6 million. 
 
 The MPF Plus product required SMI under the MPF Program when each pool was established. At September 30, 2024, 5 of the 14 MPF Plus pools still have SMI policies in place. The Bank does not currently offer the MPF Plus product and has not purchased loans under MPF Plus Commitments since July 2006. Per MPF Program guidelines, the existing MPF Plus product exposure is required to be secured by the PFI once the SMI company is rated below AA-. As of September 30, 2024, all of the SMI exposure is fully collateralized. 
 
 Derivative Counterparties. To manage interest rate risk, the Bank enters into derivative contracts. Derivative transactions may be either executed with a counterparty (referred to as uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., clearing agent) or a Swap Execution Facility with a Derivatives Clearing Organization (referred to as cleared derivatives). For uncleared derivatives, the Bank transacts most of its derivatives with large banks and major broker-dealers. Some of these banks and broker-dealers or their affiliates buy, sell, and distribute consolidated obligations. The Bank is not a derivatives dealer and does not trade derivatives for short-term profit. The Bank uses either CME Clearing or LCH Ltd. as the Clearing House for all its cleared derivative transactions. Variation margin payments are characterized as daily settlement payments, rather than collateral. Initial margin is considered cash collateral. 
 
 The Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of non-performance by counterparties to its derivative transactions. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures, collateral requirements, daily settlement and other credit enhancements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. The Bank manages credit risk through credit analysis, collateral management, and other credit enhancements. 
 32 

Uncleared Derivatives. The Bank is subject to the risk of non-performance by counterparties to its uncleared derivative transactions. The Bank requires collateral on uncleared derivative transactions. Generally, the Bank s ISDA agreements for uncleared derivatives have collateral delivery thresholds set to zero (subject to minimum transfer amounts). The Bank has a small number of legacy trades that require collateral amounts from its counterparties based on credit rating. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, the Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its uncleared derivative transactions with counterparties as of September 30, 2024. The Bank s total net credit exposure to uncleared derivative counterparties is immaterial. 
 
 Credit risk related to uncleared derivatives may be further mitigated by the change of initial margin with the Bank s derivative counterparties. However, as of September 30, 2024, the Bank did not exceed initial margin thresholds with any of its counterparties and was not required to post initial margin. If the Bank s aggregate uncleared derivative transactions exposure to a counterparty exceeds the applicable threshold, certain investment securities are required to be posted and held at a third-party custodian. 
 
 Cleared Derivatives. The Bank is subject to credit risk exposure to the Clearing Houses and clearing agent. The requirement that the Bank post initial margin and exchange variation margin settlement payments, through the clearing agent, to the Clearing Houses, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearing Houses fail to meet their obligations. Initial margin is the amount calculated based on anticipated exposure to future changes in the value of a swap and protects the Clearing Houses from market risk in the event of default by one of its clearing agents. Variation margin is the amount accumulated through daily settlement of the current exposure arising from changes in the market value of the position since the trade was executed. The Bank s use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral postings and variation margin settlement payments are made daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. The Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its cleared derivatives as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The contractual or notional amount of derivative transactions reflects the involvement of the Bank in the various classes of financial instruments. The maximum credit risk of the Bank with respect to derivative transactions is the estimated cost of replacing the derivative transactions if there is a default, minus the value of any related collateral, including initial margin and variation margin settlements on cleared derivatives. In determining maximum credit risk, the Bank considers accrued interest receivables and payables as well as the netting requirements to net assets and liabilities. The following table presents the derivative positions with non-member counterparties and member institutions to which the Bank has credit exposure at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 (1) This table does not reflect any changes in rating, outlook or watch status occurring after September 30, 2024. The ratings presented in this table represent the lowest long-term counterparty credit rating available for each counterparty based on the NRSROs used by the Bank. 
 (2) Member institutions include mortgage delivery commitments. 
 
 The Bank annually underwrites each counterparty and country and regularly monitors NRSRO rating actions and other publications to assess credit risk and determine if there have been any changes to credit quality. This includes actively monitoring counterparties with an elevated risk profile and assessing approximate indirect exposure to foreign sovereign debt.

Liquidity and Funding Risk 
 
 As a wholesale bank, the Bank employs financial strategies which enable it to expand and contract its assets, liabilities and capital in response to changes in member credit demand, membership composition and other market factors. In addition, the Bank is required to maintain a level of liquidity in accordance with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations and policies established by its management and board of directors. The Bank s liquidity resources are designed to support these strategies and requirements through a focus on maintaining a liquidity and funding balance between its financial assets and financial liabilities. 
 
 Asset/Liability Maturity Profile. The Bank is focused on maintaining adequate liquidity and funding balances with its financial assets and financial liabilities, and the FHLBanks work collectively to manage system-wide liquidity and funding needs. The Bank monitors the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities and is committed to prudent risk management practices and complies with Finance Agency requirements regarding this funding balance. External factors including member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may affect liquidity balances and the funding balances between financial assets and financial liabilities. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity. The Bank s primary sources of liquidity are proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations and a liquidity investment portfolio, as well as proceeds from the issuance of capital stock. 
 
 Consolidated Obligations. The Bank s ability to operate its business, meet its obligations and generate net interest income depends primarily on the ability to issue large amounts of various debt structures at attractive rates. Consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes, along with member deposits and capital, represent the primary funding sources used by the Bank to support its asset base. Consolidated obligations benefit from the Bank s GSE status; however, they are not obligations of the U.S., and the U.S. government does not guarantee them. Consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes are rated Aaa with negative outlook/P-1 by Moody s and AA+ with stable outlook/A-1+ by S P as of September 30, 2024. These ratings measure the likelihood of timely payment of principal and interest. Note 6 - Consolidated Obligations to the unaudited financial statements in this Form 10-Q provides additional information regarding the Bank s consolidated obligations. 
 
 Liquidity Investment Portfolio. The following investments are eligible to be included in the Bank s liquidity investment portfolio for regulatory purposes: cash, interest-bearing deposits, Federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and U.S. Treasury obligations classified as trading or AFS. 
 
 Contingency Liquidity. The Bank s sources of contingency liquidity include maturing overnight and short-term investments, maturing advances, unencumbered repurchase-eligible assets, trading securities, AFS securities, and MBS repayments. Uses of contingency liquidity include net settlements of consolidated obligations, member loan commitments, mortgage loan purchase commitments, deposit outflows and maturing other borrowed funds. Excess contingency liquidity is calculated as the difference between sources and uses of contingency liquidity. Excess contingency liquidity was approximately 30.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and 32.0 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Funding and Debt Issuance . During the first nine months of 2024, the Bank maintained continual access to funding. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preferences and risk aversion have sought the FHLBanks short-term debt as an asset of choice. The FHLBanks have maintained comparatively stable access to funding through a diverse investor base at relatively favorable spreads to U.S. Treasury rates. Changes or disruptions in the capital markets could limit the Bank s ability to issue consolidated obligations, which could impact the Bank s liquidity and cost of funds. 
 
 The Bank was able to access liquidity to meet its members needs during the period covered by this report. 
 
 Refinancing Risk. There are inherent risks in utilizing short-term funding to support longer-dated assets and the Bank may be exposed to refinancing and investor concentration risks (collectively, refinancing risk). Refinancing risk includes the risk the Bank could have difficulty in rolling over short-term obligations when market conditions change. In managing and monitoring the amounts of financial assets that require refinancing, the Bank considers their contractual maturities, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e., estimated prepayments, embedded call optionality, and scheduled amortizations). The Bank and the Office of Finance (OF) jointly monitor the combined refinancing risk of the FHLBank System. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, the Bank may consider contractual maturities of the financial assets, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e., estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations). 
 
 35 

Interest Rate Risk. The Bank may use a portion of the short-term consolidated obligations issued to fund both short- and long-term variable rate-indexed assets. However, funding longer-term variable rate-indexed assets with shorter-term liabilities generally does not expose the Bank to interest rate risk because the rates on the variable rate-indexed assets reset similar to the liabilities. The Bank measures and monitors interest rate-risk with commonly used methods and metrics, which include the calculations of market value of equity, duration of equity, and duration gap. 
 
 Regulatory Liquidity Requirements . The Bank is required to maintain a level of liquidity in accordance with certain Finance Agency guidance. Under these policies and guidelines, the Bank is required to maintain contingency liquidity to meet liquidity needs in an amount at least equal to its anticipated net cash outflows under certain scenarios. One scenario assumes that the Bank cannot access the capital markets for a period of 20 days and during that time members would renew any maturing, prepaid or called advances. In addition, the Bank is required to perform and report to the Finance Agency the results of an annual liquidity stress test. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank was in compliance with these liquidity requirements. Refer to the Liquidity and Funding Risk section in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
 Joint and Several Liability. Although the Bank is primarily liable for its portion of consolidated obligations (i.e., those issued on its behalf), the Bank is also jointly and severally liable with the other 10 FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on consolidated obligations of all the FHLBanks. The Finance Agency, in its discretion and notwithstanding any other provisions, may at any time order any FHLBank to make principal or interest payments due on any consolidated obligation, even in the absence of default by the primary obligor. To the extent that an FHLBank makes any payment on a consolidated obligation on behalf of another FHLBank, the paying FHLBank shall be entitled to reimbursement from the non-paying FHLBank, which has a corresponding obligation to reimburse the FHLBank to the extent of such assistance and other associated costs. However, if the Finance Agency determines that the non-paying FHLBank is unable to satisfy its obligations, then the Finance Agency may allocate the outstanding liability among the remaining FHLBanks on a pro rata basis in proportion to each FHLBank s participation in all consolidated obligations outstanding, or on any other basis the Finance Agency may determine. Finance Agency regulations govern the issuance of debt on behalf of the FHLBanks and authorize the FHLBanks to issue consolidated obligations, through the OF as its agent. The Bank is not permitted to issue individual debt without Finance Agency approval. See Note 6 - Consolidated Obligations of the audited financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. 

Operational and Business Risks 
 
 Operational Risk. Operational Risk is defined as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events and encompasses risks related to housing mission-related activities, including the Bank s member products and services activities and those associated with affordable housing programs or goals and other Bank business activities. The Bank considers various sources of risk of unexpected loss, including human error, fraud, unenforceability of legal contracts, deficiencies in internal controls and/or information systems, and the impact of cyber-security attacks, vendor breakdown, or damage from fire, theft, natural disaster or acts of terrorism. Generally, the category of operational risk includes loss exposures of a physical or procedural nature. Specifically, operational risk includes compliance, fraud, information/transaction, legal, cyber, vendor, people, succession and model risk. The Bank has established policies and procedures to manage each of the specific operational risks. The Bank s approach to cybersecurity risk is discussed in Item 1C. Cybersecurity in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Business Risk. Business risk is the possibility of an adverse impact on the Bank s profitability or financial or business strategies resulting from external factors that may occur in the short-term and/or long-term. This risk includes the potential for strategic business constraints to be imposed through regulatory, legislative or political changes. Examples of external factors may include, but are not limited to: macroeconomic conditions, financial services industry consolidation, a declining membership base, concentration of borrowing among members, the introduction of new competing products and services, increased non-Bank competition, weakening of the FHLBank System s GSE status, changes in the deposit and mortgage markets for the Bank s members, changes that occur as a result of legislation or new or changed regulatory guidance, including any actions which may be taken by the Finance Agency as a result of its FHLBank System at 100: Focusing on the Future review, geopolitical instability, climate change and other factors that may have a significant direct or indirect impact on the ability of the Bank to achieve its mission and strategic objectives. The Bank s various Risk Management Committees monitor economic indicators and the external environment in which the Bank operates for alignment with the Bank s risk appetite. A discussion of various Bank risks was also included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K .

 district Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks). Each FHLBank operates as a separate entity with its own management, employees and board of directors. The FHLBanks are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that serve the public by increasing the availability of credit for residential mortgages and community development. The Bank provides a readily available, low-cost source of funds to its member institutions. The Bank is a cooperative, which means that current members own nearly all of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank. All holders of the Bank s capital stock may, to the extent declared by the Board, receive dividends on their capital stock. Regulated financial depositories and insurance companies engaged in residential housing finance that maintain their principal place of business (as defined by Finance Agency regulation) in Delaware, Pennsylvania or West Virginia may apply for membership. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) which meet membership regulation standards are also eligible to become Bank members. State and local housing associates that meet certain statutory and regulatory criteria may also borrow from the Bank. While eligible to borrow, state and local housing associates are not members of the Bank and, as such, do not hold capital stock. 
 
 All members must purchase capital stock in the Bank. The amount of capital stock a member owns is based on membership requirements (membership asset value) and activity requirements (i.e., outstanding advances, letters of credit, and the principal balance of residential mortgage loans sold to the Bank). The Bank considers those members with capital stock outstanding in excess of of total capital stock outstanding to be related parties. See Note 8 - Transactions with Related Parties for additional information. 
 
 The Federal Housing Finance Agency (Finance Agency), an independent agency in the executive branch of the U.S. government, supervises and regulates the FHLBanks, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). The Finance Agency s stated mission is to ensure the housing GSEs fulfill their mission by operating in a safe and sound manner to serve as a reliable source for liquidity and funding for the housing finance market throughout the economic cycle. 
 
 As provided by the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (FHLBank Act) and applicable regulations, consolidated obligations are joint and several obligations of all the FHLBanks and are the primary source of funds for the FHLBanks. These funds are primarily used to provide advances, purchase mortgages from members through the MPF Program and purchase certain investments. See Note 6 - Consolidated Obligations for additional information. The Office of Finance (OF) is a joint office of the FHLBanks established to facilitate the issuance and servicing of the consolidated obligations of the FHLBanks and to prepare the combined quarterly and annual financial reports of all the FHLBanks. Deposits, other borrowings, and capital stock issued to members provide other funds. The Bank primarily invests these funds in short-term investments to provide liquidity. The Bank also provides member institutions with correspondent services, such as wire transfer, safekeeping and settlement with the Federal Reserve. 
 
 Certain amounts in the 2023 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year financial statement presentation. These amounts were not deemed to be material. 
 
 The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Bank conform to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Preparation of the unaudited financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K.

 Note 2 Investments 
 
 The Bank has short-term investments and may make other investments in debt securities, which are classified as trading, AFS, or HTM as further described below. 
 
 Interest-Bearing Deposits, Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell, and Federal Funds Sold 
 
 The Bank makes short-term investments in interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and Federal funds sold to provide short-term liquidity. These investments are generally transacted with counterparties that have received a credit rating of BBB or greater (investment grade) by an NRSRO. 
 
 Interest-bearing deposits and Federal funds sold are unsecured investments. Federal funds sold are generally transacted on an overnight term. Finance Agency regulations include a limit on the amount of unsecured credit the Bank may extend to a counterparty. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all investments in interest-bearing deposits and Federal funds sold were repaid according to the contractual terms; ACL was recorded for these assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Carrying values of interest-bearing deposits and Federal funds exclude accrued interest receivable which was immaterial for all periods presented. At September 30, 2024, of these investments were with counterparties rated below BBB or with unrated counterparties. These may differ from any internal ratings of the investments by the Bank, if applicable. 
 
 Securities purchased under agreements to resell are secured investments. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are generally transacted on an overnight term and have standard market practices that include collateral maintenance provisions. As such, they are evaluated regularly to determine that the securities purchased under agreements to resell are fully collateralized. The counterparty is required to deliver additional collateral if the securities purchased under agreements to resell become under-collateralized, generally by the next business day. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all investments in securities purchased under agreements to resell were repaid according to the contractual terms; ACL was recorded for these assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Carrying value of securities purchased under agreements to resell excludes accrued interest receivable which was immaterial for all periods presented. At September 30, 2024, of these investments were with counterparties rated below BBB or with unrated counterparties. These may differ from any internal ratings of the investments by the Bank, if applicable. 
 
 Debt Securities 
 
 The Bank invests in debt securities, which are classified as trading, AFS, or HTM. Within these investments, the Bank is primarily subject to credit risk related to private label MBS that are supported by underlying mortgage or asset-backed loans. In 2007, the Bank discontinued the purchase of private label MBS. The Bank is prohibited by Finance Agency regulations from purchasing certain higher-risk securities, such as equity securities and debt instruments that are not investment quality, other than certain investments targeted at low-income persons or communities. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, total investment securities and accrued interest included million of net unsettled purchases which represent a non-cash activity which are not reflected on the Statements of Cash Flows. There was million at December 31, 2023.

 ) Balance, end of period 
 
 Debt Securities ACL Methodology. To evaluate investment securities for credit losses at September 30, 2024, the Bank employs the following methodologies by major security type. 
 
 GSE and Other U.S. Obligations. The Bank invests in GSE and other U.S. obligations, which includes Tennessee Valley Authority obligations, single-family MBS, and GSE single-family and multifamily MBS. These securities are issued by Federal Agencies or U.S. government corporations and include MBS issued by these same entities that are directly supported by underlying mortgage loans. All of these securities are highly-rated. In the case of U.S. obligations, they carry an explicit government guarantee. In the case of GSE securities, they are purchased under an assumption that the issuers obligation to pay principal and interest on those securities will be honored. As a result, ACL was recorded on GSE and other U.S. obligations at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Bank only purchases GSE and other U.S. obligations considered investment quality. At September 30, 2024, all of these GSE and other U.S. obligations, based on amortized cost, were rated BBB or above by a NRSRO, based on the lowest long-term credit rating for each security. These may differ from any internal ratings of the securities by the Bank, if applicable. 
 
 State or Local Agency Obligations. The Bank invests in state or local agency obligations, such as municipal securities. These securities are subject to credit risk related to a portfolio of state and local agency obligations (i.e., Housing Finance Agency bonds). The Bank has not experienced any payment defaults on these instruments. 
 
 The Bank only purchases state or local agency obligations considered investment quality. At September 30, 2024, all of these state or local agency obligations, based on amortized cost, were rated BBB or above by a NRSRO, based on the lowest long-term credit rating for each security. These may differ from any internal ratings of the securities by the Bank, if applicable. 
 
 The Bank evaluates AFS state or local agency obligations for an ACL based on a credit assessment of the issuer, or guarantor. If the Bank determines that an ACL should be recognized, it is limited to the unrealized loss of the state or local agency obligation, including zero if it is in an unrealized gain position. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank expected to receive all cash flows contractually due, and ACL was recorded on AFS state or local agency obligations. 
 
 Private Label MBS. The Bank also holds investments in private label MBS. The Bank has not purchased any private label MBS since 2007. However, many of these securities have experienced significant credit deterioration. As of September 30, 2024, of private label MBS (AFS and HTM combined, based on amortized cost) were rated BBB or above by a NRSRO and the remaining securities were either rated less than BBB or unrated. To determine whether an ACL is necessary on these securities, the Bank uses cash flow analyses. 
 
 The Bank s evaluation includes estimating the projected cash flows that the Bank is likely to collect based on an assessment of available information, including the structure of the applicable security and certain assumptions such as: 
 
 the remaining payment terms for the security; 
 prepayment speeds based on underlying loan-level borrower and loan characteristics; 
 expected default rates based on underlying borrower and loan characteristics; 
 expected loss severity based on underlying borrower and loan characteristics; 
 expected housing price changes; and 
 expected interest-rate assumptions. 
 
 The Bank performed a cash flow analysis using a third-party model to assess whether the entire amortized cost basis of its private label MBS securities will be recovered. The projected cash flows are based on a number of assumptions and 
 51

 Credit Risk Exposure and Security Terms. The Bank s potential credit risk from advances is primarily concentrated in commercial banks. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had advances of billion outstanding to the largest borrowers, which represented of the total principal amount of advances outstanding. Of those , had outstanding advance balances that were in excess of 10 of the total portfolio at September 30, 2024. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had advances of billion outstanding to the largest borrowers, which represented of the total principal amount of advances outstanding. Of these , had outstanding advance balances that were in excess of 10 of the total portfolio at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Advances ACL. The Bank manages its total credit exposure (TCE), which includes advances, letters of credit, advance commitments, and other credit product exposure, through an integrated approach. This approach generally requires a credit limit to be established for each borrower and an ongoing review of each borrower s financial condition in conjunction with the Bank s collateral and lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing each borrower's need for a reliable source of funding. Eligible collateral and collateral requirements can vary based on the type of member: commercial banks, insurance companies, credit unions, de novo banks and CDFIs. 
 
 In addition, the Bank lends to its members in accordance with the FHLBank Act and Finance Agency regulations. Specifically, the FHLBank Act requires the Bank to obtain collateral to fully secure credit products. The estimated value of the collateral required to secure each member s credit products is calculated by applying collateral weightings, or haircuts, to the value of the collateral. The Bank primarily accepts cash, certain investment securities, residential mortgage loans, and other real estate related assets as collateral. In addition, Community Financial Institutions (CFIs) are eligible to utilize expanded statutory collateral provisions for small business, agriculture, and community development loans. The Bank s capital stock owned by the borrowing member is pledged as secondary collateral. Collateral arrangements may vary depending upon borrower credit quality, financial condition and performance, borrowing capacity, and overall credit exposure to the borrower. The Bank can require additional or substitute collateral to help ensure that credit products continue to be secured by adequate collateral. Management of the Bank believes that these policies effectively manage the Bank s credit risk from credit products. 
 
 Based upon the financial condition of the member, the Bank either allows a member to retain physical possession of the collateral assigned to the Bank or requires the member to specifically deliver physical possession or control of the collateral to the Bank or its custodians. However, regardless of the member s financial condition, the Bank always takes possession or control of securities used as collateral. The Bank perfects its security interest in all pledged collateral. The FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the Bank by a member (or an affiliate of a member) priority over the claims or rights of any other party, except for claims or rights of a third-party that would be otherwise entitled to priority under applicable law and that are held by a bona fide purchaser for value or by a secured party holding a prior perfected security interest. 
 
 Using a risk-based approach, the Bank considers the payment status, collateral types and concentration levels, and borrower s financial condition to be indicators of credit quality on its credit products. The Bank s assessment of a member s financial condition may require certain risk mitigation actions, including reduced collateral weights, delivery of pledged collateral, reduced advance tenor, and change in availability of certain credit products.

 Conventional MPF Loans - Credit Enhancements (CE). The conventional MPF loans held for portfolio are required to be credit enhanced as determined through the use of a validated model so the risk of loss is limited to the losses within the Bank s risk tolerance. The Bank and its PFIs share the risk of credit losses on conventional MPF loan products held for portfolio, by structuring potential losses into layers with respect to each master commitment. After considering the borrower s equity and any PMI, credit losses on mortgage loans in a master commitment are then absorbed by the Bank s FLA. If applicable to the MPF product, the Bank will withhold a PFI s scheduled performance CE fee in order to reimburse the Bank for any losses allocated to the FLA (recaptured CE Fees). If the FLA is exhausted, the credit losses are then absorbed by the PFI up to an agreed upon CE amount. The CE amount could be covered by SMI obtained by the PFI. Thereafter, any remaining credit losses are absorbed by the Bank. 
 
 Payment Status of Mortgage Loans. Payment status is the key credit quality indicator for conventional mortgage loans and allows the Bank to monitor the migration of past due loans. Past due loans are those where the borrower has failed to make timely payments of principal and/or interest in accordance with the terms of the loan. Other delinquency statistics include nonaccrual loans and loans in process of foreclosure.

 Government-Guaranteed or -Insured Mortgage Loans. The Bank invests in government-guaranteed or insured fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties. Government-guaranteed or insured mortgage loans are those insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Rural Housing Service (RHS) of the Department of Agriculture and/or by Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The servicer provides and maintains insurance or a guarantee from the applicable government agency. The servicer is responsible for compliance with all government agency requirements and for obtaining the benefit of the applicable guarantee or insurance with respect to defaulted government-guaranteed or -insured mortgage loans. Any losses on these loans that are not recovered from the issuer or the guarantor are absorbed by the servicer. Therefore, the Bank only has credit risk for these loans if the servicer fails to pay for losses not covered by the guarantee or insurance, but in such instance, the Bank would have recourse against the servicer for such failure. Based on the Bank s assessment of its servicers and the collateral backing the loans, the risk of loss was immaterial. Consequently, the Bank has recorded an ACL for government-guaranteed or -insured mortgage loans at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Furthermore, of these mortgage loans have been placed on non-accrual status because of the U.S. government guarantee or insurance on these loans and the contractual obligation of the loan servicer to repurchase the loans when certain criteria are met. 
 
 Real Estate Owned (REO) . The amount of REO reported in Other assets on the Statements of Condition was immaterial at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Note 5 Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
 
 Nature of Business Activity. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the effect of interest rate changes on its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that finance these assets. The goal of the Bank s interest rate risk management strategy is not to eliminate interest rate risk but to manage it within appropriate limits. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Bank has established policies and procedures that include guidelines on the amount of exposure to interest rate changes it is willing to accept. In addition, the Bank monitors the risk to its interest income, net interest margin and average maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For additional information on the Bank s derivative transactions, see Note 7 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities to the audited financial statements in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Derivative transactions may be executed either with a counterparty (referred to as uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., clearing agent) with a Derivatives Clearing Organization (referred to as cleared derivatives). The Bank is not a derivatives dealer and does not trade derivatives for short-term profit. The Bank transacts uncleared derivatives with counterparties that are large banks and major broker-dealers. Some of these banks and broker-dealers or their affiliates buy, sell, and distribute consolidated obligations.

 Managing Credit Risk on Derivatives. 

Cleared Derivatives. For cleared derivatives, Derivative Clearing Organizations (Clearing Houses) are the Bank s counterparties. The Clearing Houses notify the clearing agent of the required initial and variation margin. The requirement that the Bank post initial margin and exchange variation margin settlement payments through the clearing agent, which notifies the Bank on behalf of the Clearing Houses, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearing Houses fail to meet their respective obligations. The use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure through the use of a central counterparty instead of individual counterparties. Collateral postings and variation margin settlement payments are made daily, through a clearing agent, for changes in the value of cleared derivatives. Initial margin is the amount calculated based on anticipated exposure to future changes in the value of a swap and protects the Clearing Houses from market risk in the event of default by one of their respective clearing agents. Variation margin is paid daily to settle the exposure arising from changes in the market value of the position. The Bank uses either CME Clearing or LCH Ltd. as the Clearing House for cleared derivative transactions. Variation margin payments are characterized as settled to market, rather than collateral. Initial margin is considered collateralized to market. 
 
 Based on credit analyses and collateral requirements, the Bank does not anticipate credit losses related to its derivative agreements. See Note 9 - Estimated Fair Values for discussion regarding the Bank s fair value methodology for derivative assets and liabilities, including an evaluation of the potential for the fair value of these instruments to be affected by counterparty credit risk. 
 61 

Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements (continued) 

For cleared derivatives, the Clearing House determines initial margin requirements and generally credit ratings are not factored into the initial margin. However, clearing agents may require additional initial margin to be posted based on credit considerations, including but not limited to credit rating downgrades. The Bank was not required by its clearing agents to post additional initial margin at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Derivative Liabilities . When it has met the netting requirements, the Bank presents derivative instruments, related cash collateral, received or pledged, and associated accrued interest on a net basis by clearing agent and/or by counterparty. The Bank has analyzed the enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in its cleared derivative transactions and determined that the exercise of those offsetting rights by a non-defaulting party under these transactions should be upheld under applicable law upon an event of default including a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding involving the Clearing Houses or the Bank s clearing agent, or both. Based on this analysis, the Bank nets derivative fair values on all of its transactions through a particular clearing agent with a particular Clearing House (including settled variation margin) into one net asset or net liability exposure. Initial margin posted to the Clearing House is presented as a derivative asset.

 Note 7 Capital 
 
 The Bank is subject to capital requirements under its current Capital Plan Structure and the Finance Agency rules and regulations: (1) risk-based capital; (2) total regulatory capital; and (3) leverage capital. Regulatory capital does not include AOCI, but does include mandatorily redeemable capital stock. See details regarding these requirements and the Bank s Capital Plan in Note 11 to the audited financial statements in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. At September 30, 2024, the Bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements. 
 
 The Bank has subclasses of capital stock: B1 membership stock and B2 activity stock. The Bank had million in B1 membership stock and million in B2 activity stock at September 30, 2024. The Bank had million in B1 membership stock and million in B2 activity stock at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Each class of the Bank s capital stock is considered putable by the member and the Bank may repurchase, at its sole discretion, any member s stock investments that exceed the required minimum amount. However, there are statutory and regulatory restrictions on the obligation to redeem, or right to repurchase, the outstanding stock. As a result, whether or not a member may have its capital stock in the Bank repurchased (at the Bank s discretion at any time before the end of the redemption period) or redeemed (at a member s request, completed at the end of a redemption period) will depend in part on whether the Bank is in compliance with those restrictions. 
 
 Finance Agency rules limit the ability of the Bank to create member excess stock under certain circumstances. For example, a Bank may not pay dividends in the form of capital stock or issue new excess stock to members if its excess stock exceeds one percent of its total assets or if the issuance of excess stock would cause the Bank s excess stock to exceed one percent of its total assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s excess capital stock did not exceed one percent of its total assets. 
 
 Total capital-to-asset ratio Total regulatory capital Leverage ratio Leverage capital 
 
 The Finance Agency has established four capital classifications for the FHLBanks: adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. On September 26, 2024, the Bank received final notification from the Finance Agency that it was considered adequately capitalized for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. As of the date of this filing, the Bank has not received final notice from the Finance Agency regarding its capital classification for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock. The Bank is a cooperative whose member financial institutions and former members own all of the relevant Bank issued and outstanding capital stock. Shares cannot be purchased or sold except between the Bank and its members at the shares par value of , as mandated by the Bank s Capital Plan. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had million and million, respectively, in capital stock subject to mandatory redemption with payment subject to a five-year waiting period and the Bank meeting its minimum regulatory capital requirements. The dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock recorded as interest expense were million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 As of September 30, 2024, the total mandatorily redeemable capital stock reflected the balance for institutions. institutions were merged out of district and are considered to be non-members. The stock includes activity stock for former member who relocated its principal place of business outside the Bank s district and became a member of another FHLBank at which time the membership with the Bank terminated. other institutions have notified the Bank of their intention to voluntarily redeem their capital stock and withdraw from membership. These institutions will continue to be members of the Bank until the withdrawal period is completed.

 Total 
 
 Under the terms of the Bank s Capital Plan, membership capital stock is redeemable five years from the date of membership termination or withdrawal notice from the member. If the membership is terminated due to a merger or consolidation, the membership capital stock is deemed to be excess stock and is repurchased. The activity capital stock (i.e., supporting advances, letters of credit and MPF) relating to termination, withdrawal, mergers or consolidation is recalculated based on the underlying activity. Any excess activity capital stock is repurchased on an ongoing basis as part of the Bank s excess stock repurchase program that is in effect at the time. Therefore, the redemption period could be less than five years if the stock becomes excess stock. However, the redemption period could extend beyond five years if the underlying activity is still outstanding. 
 
 Dividends and Retained Earnings. In accordance with the Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement (JCEA), entered into by the Bank, as amended, the Bank allocates on a quarterly basis of its net income to a separate restricted retained earnings account (RRE) until the account balance equals at least of the Bank s average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the current quarter. These RRE are not available to pay dividends and are presented separately from other retained earnings on the Statements of Condition. Additionally, the JCEA provides that amounts in restricted retained earnings in excess of of the Bank s restricted retained earnings minimum (i.e., one percent of the average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter) may be released from restricted retained earnings. At September 30, 2024, retained earnings were million, including million of unrestricted retained earnings and million of RRE. 
 
 Dividends paid by the Bank are subject to Board approval and may be paid in either capital stock or cash; historically, the Bank has paid cash dividends only. The dividend paid to the member is calculated based on the average capital stock owned by the member for the previous quarter.

Summary of Valuation Methodologies and Primary Inputs 
 
 The valuation methodologies and primary inputs used to develop the measurement of fair value for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis in the Statements of Condition are listed below. 

During the year, the Bank conducts reviews of its pricing vendors to enhance its understanding of the vendors' pricing processes, methodologies and control procedures. To the extent available, the Bank also reviews the vendors' independent auditors' reports regarding the internal controls over their valuation processes. 

As of September 30, 2024, for substantially all of its MBS, the Bank received a price from all of its vendors and the default price was the final price. Based on the Bank s reviews of the pricing methods including inputs and controls employed by the third-party pricing vendors and the relative lack of dispersion among the vendor prices (or, in those instances in which there were outliers or significant yield variances, the Bank s additional analyses), the Bank believes the final prices are representative of the prices that would have been received if the assets had been sold at the measurement date (i.e., exit prices) and further that the fair value measurements are classified appropriately in the fair value hierarchy. There continues to be unobservable inputs and a lack of significant market activity for private label MBS; therefore, the Bank classified private label MBS as Level 3.

 Commitments to Extend Credit on Standby Letters of Credit. Standby letters of credit are issued on behalf of members for a fee. A standby letter of credit is a financing arrangement between the Bank and its member. If the Bank is required to make payment for a beneficiary s draw, these amounts are withdrawn from the member s Demand Deposit Account (DDA). Any remaining amounts not covered by the withdrawal from the member s DDA are converted into a collateralized overnight advance. 
 
 Unearned fees related to standby letters of credit are recorded in other liabilities and had a balance of million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. 

The Bank does not have any legally binding or unconditional unused lines of credit for advances at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. However, within the Bank s Rollover (weekly/monthly) advance product, there were conditional lines of credit outstanding of billion at September 30, 2024 and billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Commitments to Purchase Mortgage Loans. The Bank may enter into commitments that unconditionally obligate the Bank to purchase mortgage loans under the MPF Program. These delivery commitments are generally for periods not to exceed days. Such commitments are recorded as derivatives. 
 
 Pledged Collateral. The Bank may pledge cash and securities, as collateral, related to derivatives. Refer to Note 5 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities in this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Bank s pledged collateral and other credit-risk-related contingent features. 
 
 Legal Proceedings. The Bank is subject to legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. The Bank would record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. After consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liability, if any, arising out of these matters will have a material effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Notes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 also discuss other commitments and contingencies.
