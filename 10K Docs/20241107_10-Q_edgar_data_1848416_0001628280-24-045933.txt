 Although we believe that the expectations and assumptions on which forward-looking statements are based are reasonable at the time made, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements, because no assurance can be given that they will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, and thus involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that the above list of cautionary statements is not exhaustive. 
 The cannabis industry involves risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on various factors. Certain forward-looking statements contained herein concerning the cannabis industry and our general expectations concerning the cannabis industry are based on estimates prepared by us using data from publicly available governmental sources as well as from market research and industry analysis and on assumptions based on data and knowledge of the cannabis industry. Such data is inherently imprecise. 
 Consequently, all forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q and our other documents are qualified by such cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the anticipated results or developments will actually be realized or, even if realized, that they will have the expected consequences to or effects on us. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required under applicable securities legislation.

GGH filed a response to such counterclaim on December 7, 2022, in which GGH denied it was obligated to pay any termination fee or transaction expenses. As of September 30, 2024, both the Company and GGH are engaged in ongoing discovery efforts. 
 
 On May 2, 2024, GGH filed an application with the Supreme Court of British Columbia seeking an order granting summary trial in the ongoing litigation between the Company and GGH regarding the GGH Arrangement Agreement. In the application, GGH stated it is seeking in damages, plus costs and interest (the GGH Application for Summary Trial ). On June 19, 2024, the Company filed an application in response seeking: (i) dismissal of the GGH Application for Summary Trial on the grounds that the issues raised by it are not suitable for disposition by summary trial and will not assist the efficient resolution of the proceeding; and (ii) an order that the report on damages filed by GGH in support of the GGH Application for Summary Trial is inadmissible and shall be excluded from evidence in the trial, or any summary trial, of this matter. On September 17, 2024, the Company filed an amended response and counterclaim with the Supreme Court of British Columbia, primarily in response to communications recently disclosed by GGH. The Company can provide no guarantees or assurances that it will prevail or settle this lawsuit or its counterclaim on favorable terms, if at all, and an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

Non-Current Assets Current Liabilities Non-Current Liabilities Equity attributable to Verano Holdings Corp. ) 
 Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 
 Consolidated VIEs occur when (a) the Company closes an acquisition while the state has not finalized the transfer of the cannabis license or (b) the Company owns an equity interest in a joint venture, which it exercises control over. 
 Consolidation occurs on the effective date of the purchase agreement, or in the case of joint venture VIEs, on the effective date of a limited liability company agreement governing the applicable joint venture, and an MSA. The MSA grants the management company, Verano, the ability to make business operating decisions, manage and staff employees, determine product mix, and the authority to direct allocation of cash. The MSA or the limited liability company agreement also allows Verano to limit distributions of the entity at Verano s discretion. Certain states may limit the distribution or transfer of cash until license transfer. 
 The Company has entered into financing arrangements with certain VIEs to provide funding for potential capital expenditures including, but not limited to, the construction of dispensaries and other facilities. 
 The Company applies ASC 810-10-15 to determine control of the legal entity. With respect to VIEs acquired via acquisition, the purchase agreements limit the sellers involvement in future operations, and their risks of loss. With respect to joint venture VIEs, the limited liability company agreements limit the partners involvement in future operations and control over financial decisions, including distributions. In addition, Verano enters into an MSA with the legal entity that grants the Company strategic decision-making ability of the business operations. 
 The Company is involved in all qualitative and quantitative aspects of each consolidated VIE, such as but not limited to, software choices, procurement, staffing and payroll, advertising, and use of cash flow. With respect to VIEs acquired via acquisition, the Company absorbs all risk of loss and receives expected future returns based on the purchase agreement and MSA, resulting in Verano being the primary beneficiary. 
 Verano does not fully own all entities consolidated under ASC 810 and records a non-controlling interest for such non-owned portion in the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The income of less-than-wholly owned entities is attributed to non-controlling interest and Verano based on the contractual arrangements between the other interest holders and Verano, or, in the absence of contractual arrangements, on a pro rata basis based on relative ownership percentage. As an exception to the aforementioned attribution method, during periods in which a less-than-wholly owned entity records an accumulated deficit, the net losses of the less-than-wholly owned subsidiary are, generally, attributed entirely to Verano.

However, the Company s financial statements and accompanying notes may not be an indication of the Company's financial condition and results of operations in the future. 
 
 OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY 
 Verano, one of the U.S. cannabis industry s leading companies based on historical revenue, geographical scope and brand performance, is a vertically integrated, multi-state operator embracing a mission of saying Yes to plant progress and the bold exploration of cannabis. An operator of licensed cannabis cultivation, processing, wholesale distribution and retail facilities, our goal is the ongoing development of communal wellness by providing responsible access to regulated medical and adult-use cannabis products to discerning customers. As of November 5, 2024, Verano's active operations span 14 states, including 152 retail dispensaries and 15 cultivation and processing facilities with over 1.1 million square feet of cultivation capacity. We produce a wide variety of high quality cannabis products sold under our portfolio of consumer brands, including Encore , Avexia , M V , Savvy , BITS and Verano . We also design, build and operate branded retail environments including Zen Leaf and M V dispensaries that deliver a cannabis shopping experience in both medical and adult-use markets, including through Cabbage Club, an annual membership program offering exclusive benefits for cannabis consumers. 
 Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of medical, and in some cases, also adult-use (i.e., recreational) cannabis, at the state level, it remains illegal under U.S. federal law to cultivate, manufacture, distribute, sell or possess cannabis in the U.S. Because federal law prohibits transporting any federally restricted substance across state lines, cannabis cannot be transported across state lines. As a result of current federal law prohibitions, the U.S. cannabis industry is conducted on a state-by-state basis. To date, in the U.S. 38 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Marina Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have authorized comprehensive medical cannabis programs, 24 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have authorized comprehensive programs for medical and adult-use (i.e. recreational) cannabis, and 7 states allow the use of low tetrahydrocannabinol and high cannabidiol products for specified medical uses. Verano operates within states where cannabis use, medical or both medical and adult-use, has been approved by state and local regulatory bodies. Strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 
 Our strategy is to vertically integrate as a single cohesive company in multiple states through the consolidation of seed-to-sale cultivating, manufacturing, distributing, and dispensing cannabis brands and products at scale. Our cultivation, processing and wholesale distribution of cannabis consumer packaged goods are designed to support our national retail dispensary chains, and to develop and foster long-term wholesale supply relationships with third-party retail dispensary operators. Our strategy includes geographic diversity by establishing a footprint to enable us to adapt to changes in both industry and market conditions.

The selected Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated financial information below may not be indicative of the Company's future performance. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, as Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Revenues, net of discounts 216,683 240,088 (23,405) Gross Profit 109,097 133,220 (24,123) Net Loss attributable to Verano Holdings Corp. Subsidiaries (42,567) (17,842) (24,725) Net Loss per share basic diluted (0.12) (0.05) (0.07) 
 Revenues, net of discounts 
 Revenues, net of discounts, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 216,683, a decrease of (23,405) or (9.7) , compared to revenue of 240,088 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by expected declines in New Jersey and Illinois retail as third-party dispensaries continue to open across these states and a decline in product availability in our Florida market due to cultivation expansion projects. This is partially offset by new Zen Leaf store openings in the Connecticut market during the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and acquisition activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, c onsistent with other multi-state cannabis operators, the Company has continued to see increased competition and promotional activity in select retail markets, specifically in New Jersey and Illinois. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company opened two new stores in Florida and acquired eight additional stores, two in Arizona and six in Virginia, as part of acquisition activity. Retail revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 64.5 of total revenue compared to 66.8 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023, in each case, excluding intersegment eliminations. Cultivation (wholesale) revenues decreased due to competition related to third-party wholesale sales, mainly in the New Jersey market, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cultivation (wholesale) revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 35.5 of total revenue compared to 33.2 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023, in each case, excluding intersegment eliminations. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 109,097, representing a gross profit margin on the sale of cannabis, cannabis extractions, edibles and related accessories of 50.3 . This is compared to gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 133,220, which represented a 55.5 gross profit margin on the sale of cannabis, cannabis extractions, edibles and related accessories. The decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin on the sale of cannabis, cannabis extractions, edibles and related accessories during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was due to reduced top-line revenue coupled with a 3,280 non-cash impact related to the inventory step-up from acquisitions, partially offset by Ohio adult-use launch during August 2024. Also, the Company continued to experience price compression in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and New Jersey due to increased competition.

 Revenues, net of discounts 
 Revenues, net of discounts, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 660,379, a decrease of (40,884) or (5.8) , compared to revenue of 701,263 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by expected declines in New Jersey and Illinois retail markets as third-party dispensaries continue to open across the states. This is partially offset by increases in Maryland retail and wholesale in relation to the adult-use program launch in July 2023, new Zen Leaf store openings in the Connecticut market during the third and fourth quarters of 2023, and acquisition activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company opened eight new stores, one in Connecticut, six in Florida and one in Pennsylvania. Additionally, the Company acquired eight additional stores, two in Arizona and six in Virginia, as part of acquisition activity during the third quarter of 2024. C onsistent with other multi-state cannabis operators, the Company has continued to see increased competition and promotional activity in select retail markets, specifically in New Jersey and Illinois. Retail revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 64.9 of total revenue compared to 68.2 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in each case, excluding intersegment eliminations. Increased cultivation (wholesale) revenues were driven by third-party wholesale sales in the New Jersey market and increased adult-use third-party wholesale sales in the Maryland market, both, of which attributed to increased production output and sales of cannabis flower and cannabis related products when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cultivation (wholesale) revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 35.1 of total revenue compared to 31.8 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in each case, excluding intersegment eliminations.

 Results of Operations by Segment 
 The Company has two reportable segments: (i) cultivation (wholesale) and (ii) retail. Due to the vertically integrated nature of its business, the Company reviews its revenue at the cultivation (wholesale) and retail levels while reviewing its operating results on a consolidated basis. 
 The following tables summarize revenues, net of discounts, by segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Revenues, net of discounts Cultivation (Wholesale) 90,450 92,389 (1,939) (2.1) Retail 164,404 185,707 (21,303) (11.5) Intersegment Eliminations (38,171) (38,008) (163) 0.4 Total Revenues, net of discounts 216,683 240,088 (23,405) (9.7) 
 Revenues, net of discounts, for the cultivation (wholesale) segment were 90,450 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of (1,939) or (2.1) , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, in each case, excluding intersegment eliminations. The decrease in cultivation (wholesale) revenues, net of discounts, was primarily driven by competition related to third-party wholesale sales, mainly in the New Jersey market. 
 Revenues, net of discounts, for the retail segment were 164,404 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of (21,303) or (11.5) , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, in each case, excluding intersegment eliminations. Top contributors to retail sales were new Zen Leaf store openings in the Connecticut market during the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and acquisition activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in retail revenues, net of discounts was primarily driven by increased competition in both the New Jersey and Illinois markets which contributed to the year over year revenue decrease. 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Revenues, net of discounts Cultivation (Wholesale) 268,829 259,266 9,563 3.7 Retail 497,675 556,307 (58,632) (10.5) Intersegment Eliminations (106,125) (114,310) 8,185 (7.2) Total Revenues, net of discounts 660,379 701,263 (40,884) (5.8)

The increase in cultivation (wholesale) revenues, net of discounts, was primarily driven by increased third-party wholesale sales in the Illinois and New Jersey markets coupled with a burgeoning adult-use third-party wholesale sales in the Maryland market, partially offset by increased competition in the New Jersey third-party wholesale market during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Revenues, net of discounts, for the retail segment were 497,675 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of (58,632) or (10.5) , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in each case, excluding intersegment eliminations. Top contributors to retail sales were mainly due to increases in Maryland retail and wholesale in relation to the adult-use program launch in July 2023, new Zen Leaf store openings in the Connecticut market during the third and fourth quarters of 2023, and acquisition activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The overall decrease in retail revenues, net of discounts, was primarily driven by continued increased competition and promotional activity, as expected, in select retail markets, specifically in New Jersey and Illinois. Additionally, modest pricing pressure contributed to the decrease in revenues, net of discounts, when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Drivers of Operational Performance 
 Revenue 
 The Company derives its revenue from both its cultivation (wholesale) business in which it cultivates, produces and sells cannabis products to third-party retail customers, and its retail business, in which it directly sells cannabis products to retail patients and consumers. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 35.5 of the Company s revenue was generated from the cultivation (wholesale) business, excluding intersegment eliminations, and approximately 64.5 from the retail business, excluding intersegment eliminations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 35.1 of revenue was generated from the cultivation (wholesale) business and approximately 64.9 from the retail business, excluding intersegment eliminations. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit is revenue less cost of goods sold, net. Cost of goods sold, net includes the costs directly attributable to product sales and includes amounts paid for finished goods, such as flower, edibles, and concentrates, as well as packaging and other supplies, fees for services and processing, rent, utilities, and related costs. Cannabis costs are affected by various state regulations that limits the sourcing and procurement of cannabis products, which may create fluctuations in gross profit over comparative periods as the regulatory environment changes. Gross margin measures the Company s gross profit as a percentage of revenue. 
 The Company s expansion strategy and revenue growth have taken priority and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future as it expands its footprint, by exploring new markets and opening or acquiring new dispensary locations, and scales production within current markets. In the core markets in which the Company is already operational and, as the state markets mature, the Company anticipates that there will be pressure on margins in the cultivation (wholesale) and retail channels. The Company s current production capacity has not been fully realized and it is expected that price compression at the cultivation (wholesale) level, will be offset by operational optimization. 
 Total Expenses 
 Total expenses, other than the cost of goods sold, consist of selling costs to support customer relationships and to deliver product to the Company s retail stores. It also includes a significant investment in the corporate infrastructure required to support ongoing business. 
 Selling costs generally correlate to revenue. As a percentage of sales, selling costs are expected to increase slightly in currently operational markets (Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia) as facility and market expansion occurs. The increase is expected to be driven primarily by the growth of the Company s retail and cultivation (wholesale) channels and the ramp up from new retail openings. 
 SG A expenses also include costs incurred at the Company s corporate offices, primarily related to back-office personnel costs, including salaries, incentive compensation, benefits, stock-based compensation and professional service costs. Going forward, SG A expenses are expected to continue in line with the Company s expansion plans. Furthermore, the Company expects to continue to incur acquisition and transaction costs related to these expansion plans and anticipates stock compensation expenses related to recruiting and hiring talent, along with legal and professional fees associated with being a public-reporting company and publicly traded in Canada and a public-reporting company in the U.S. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The Company is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates and, consequently, income tax expense is a function of the allocation of taxable income by jurisdiction and the various activities that impact the timing of taxable events. As the Company operates in the cannabis industry, it is subject to the limits of Section 280E of the Code under which the Company is only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to the sale of products. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-allowable under Section 280E of the Code and a higher effective tax rate than most industries. 
 During the second quarter of 2023, Connecticut, Illinois, and New Jersey enacted tax legislation to exempt, or decouple, from Section 280E of the Code, all of which became retroactively effective as of January 1, 2023. The Company has significant operations in these states and is now permitted to deduct ordinary and necessary cannabis business expenses in these states.

 LIQUIDITY, FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had total current liabilities of 435,375 and 412,188, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 64,981 and 174,760, respectively, to meet its current obligations. The Company had working capital deficit of (113,654) as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of working capital of (95,662) as compared to December 31, 2023. This decrease in working capital was largely driven by acquisition activity and capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company is an early-stage growth company, generating cash from revenues and deploying its capital to acquire and develop assets capable of producing additional revenues and earnings over both the immediate and long term. Capital is primarily being utilized for capital expenditures, facility improvements, strategic investment opportunities, product development and marketing, as well as customer, supplier, and investor and industry relations. The Company takes a cautious approach in allocating its capital to maximize its returns while ensuring appropriate liquidity. Given inflation and the uncertainty of the future economic environment, the Company has taken additional measures in monitoring and deploying its capital to minimize the negative impact on its operations and expansion plans. 
 Liquidity Requirements 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our acquisitions, to repay borrowings, maintain our operations and other general business needs. We believe that internally generated funds and other sources of liquidity discussed below will be sufficient to meet working capital needs, capital expenditures, payments of income tax payables and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. We believe we will meet known or reasonably likely future cash requirements through the combination of cash generated from operating activities, available cash balances and available borrowings. If these sources of liquidity need to be augmented, additional cash requirements would likely be financed through the issuance of equity securities or additional borrowings; however, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional equity financing or debt financing on acceptable terms in the future. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of completing additional acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt payments, future payments of income tax payables, maintaining and expanding our operations and other general business needs. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include future debt or equity issuances, net cash provided by operations and other secured and unsecured borrowings. We believe that the foregoing sources of capital will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated expansion and scheduled debt payments for the long-term. Our ability to fund our operating needs will depend on our future ability to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing on acceptable terms. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 On October 27, 2022, Verano and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates from time-to-time party thereto (collectively, the Borrowers ), entered into a Credit Agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement with Chicago Atlantic Admin, LLC Chicago Atlantic ), as administrative agent for the lenders, and the lenders from time-to-time party thereto (the Lenders ), pursuant to which the Lenders advanced the Borrowers a 350,000 senior secured term loan, all of which was used to repay the principal indebtedness outstanding under the Company's previous senior secured term loan credit facility.

 The 2022 Credit Agreement provides for a floating annual interest rate equal to the prime rate then in effect plus 6.50 , which rate may be increased by 3.00 upon an event of default that is not a material event of default or 6.00 upon a material event of default. 
 At any time, the Company may voluntarily prepay up to 100,000 of the principal balance, subject to a one-time 1,000 prepayment premium upon the first prepayment, and may prepay the remaining outstanding principal balance for a prepayment premium at varying rates based on the timing of any subsequent prepayments. The Borrowers may not voluntarily prepay more than 100,000 of the principal balance without prepaying the entire outstanding principal balance of the loan. 
 The 2022 Credit Agreement includes customary representations and warranties and covenants and customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to material indebtedness, and events of bankruptcy and insolvency. 
 The 2022 Credit Agreement also includes customary negative covenants limiting the Borrowers ability to incur additional indebtedness and grant liens that are not otherwise permitted, and the ability to enter into or consummate acquisitions or dispositions that are not otherwise permitted, among others. Additionally, the 2022 Credit Agreement requires the Borrowers to meet certain financial tests regarding minimum cash balances, minimum levels of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with such covenants.

 In connection with such Permitted Partial Optional Prepayment, Chicago Atlantic and certain Lenders agreed to (a) release certain Borrowers from their obligations under, and as parties to, the 2022 Credit Agreement and related agreements (the Released Borrowers and (b) release all liens over the Released Borrowers property, including real estate, held by Chicago Atlantic for the benefit of the Lenders, in each case, pursuant to a limited consent and waiver, dated as of April 29, 2024, by and among the Borrowers, certain of the Lenders party thereto and Chicago Atlantic. 
 Columbia Care Eastern Virginia LLC

Pursuant to the Virginia EPA, the Company issued the CC East Virginia Promissory Note in the amount of 26,700, which is subject to further adjustment, and which bears interest at a rate of 7 per annum beginning on the closing date, through maturity on the two-year anniversary of the closing date. 
 Tax Liabilities 
 The Company has U.S. income tax payable liabilities. These income tax payable liabilities will require payment from our liquidity sources, and we believe we have sufficient liquidity for both short-term and long-term payments of our income tax payable liabilities and in addition to our other obligations.

 There have been no material changes to our market risk disclosures as set forth in Part II, Item 7A of the Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who is our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (who is our principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting identified as of December 31, 2023 and as described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in the Form 10-K. We believe, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 Section IX.4 Severability . Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, illegality or unenforceability,

without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible. 
 Section IX.5 Interpretation . The headings and captions used in this Agreement and the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit attached hereto and not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set forth in this Agreement. The use of the word including herein shall mean including without limitation . The Parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have independent significance. Except where otherwise expressly provided, all amounts in this Agreement are stated and shall be paid in United States currency. The Parties and their respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the Parties, and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. This Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arm s-length negotiations and no Person has any special relationship with another Person that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm s-length transaction. 
 Section IX.6 Entire Agreement . All Schedules attached hereto or referred to herein and the recitals to this Agreement are each hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement. This Agreement and the agreements and documents referred to herein contain the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to such subject matter in any way (including the letter of intent with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby), provided , that the covenants contained in Section 6.7 shall not supersede any covenants contained in any other agreement between Cannabist or a Member and any of the Buyer Group, but instead shall coexist with, and be enforceable independent of, any such similar covenants.

 Section IX.8 Governing law Waiver of Jury Trial Arbitration . The Law of the state of Delaware shall govern (a) all claims or matters related to or arising from this Agreement (including any tort or non-contractual claims) and (b) any questions concerning the construction, interpretation, validity and enforceability of this Agreement, and the performance of the obligations imposed by this Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice-of-law 
 52 
 
 FH12251261.5 

or conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the state of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the state of Delaware. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND OR THE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES HEREUNDER. Subject to Section 9.9 below, and except for the dispute resolution provisions set forth in Section 2.4 (Post-Closing Adjustments), the Parties agree to submit all disputes, claims or controversies concerning this Agreement to neutral, binding arbitration at JAMS, pursuant to the JAMS Arbitration Administrative Policies and, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, to the applicable JAMS Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Any such arbitration shall take place in Chicago, Illinois. For cases proceeding under the JAMS Comprehensive Rules, the parties agree that the Expedited Procedures set forth in Rules 16.1 and 16.2 shall be employed. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator selected from the JAMS roster of arbitrators. The arbitrator shall be selected through a mutual strike process administered by JAMS if Buyer and Cannabist cannot agree on the selection of a mutually agreeable arbitrator from the JAMS roster. The discovery in any such arbitration shall be reasonably limited by the arbitrator to effectuate the customary goals of arbitration to achieve cost-efficient resolution of disputes. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall not be appealed from or contested in any court. Any award rendered hereunder may be entered for enforcement, if necessary, in any court of competent jurisdiction. By entering into this Agreement, and subject to Section 9.9 below, the Parties knowingly and voluntarily waive their right to submit any dispute to the federal or state courts of any jurisdiction. 
 Section IX.9 Specific Performance . Each Party acknowledges and affirms that in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached, money damages would be inadequate (and therefore the non-breaching Party would have no adequate remedy at law) and the non-breaching Party would be irreparably damaged. Accordingly, each Party agrees that each other Party shall be entitled to specific performance, an injunction or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security or needing to prove irreparable harm) to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any Proceeding instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter (subject to the provisions set forth in Section 9.8 ), in addition to any other remedy to which such Person may be entitled, at law or in equity. 
 Section IX.10 No Third-Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any Person, other than the Parties and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder (other than in respect of Buyer Indemnified Parties who are express third-party beneficiaries hereunder and entitled to enforce certain obligations hereunder). 
 53 
 
 FH12251261.5 

Section IX.11 Schedules . Except as otherwise provided in the Schedules attached hereto (the Schedules ), all capitalized terms used therein shall have the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement. The inclusion of any information in the Schedules will not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment that such information is required to be listed in the Schedules or that such items are material. The Schedules are arranged in sections corresponding to the sections contained in this Agreement merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Schedules as an exception to a particular covenant, agreement, representation or warranty will be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other covenants, agreements, representations and warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such other covenants, agreements, representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on its face without independent knowledge of the reader by the presence of an appropriate cross-reference thereto or other appropriate means. 
 Section IX.12 Excluded Claims . While certain states in the United States have adopted Laws that authorize certain activities with relation to cannabis and marijuana, 21 USC 841(A)(I) of the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act 21 USC 811 CSA continues to make the manufacture, distribution, or possession with intent to distribute cannabis illegal under United States Federal Law. The United States Federal Government regulates cannabis possession and use through the CSA, which classifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance. United States Federal Law prohibits physicians from dispensing a Schedule I controlled substance, including marijuana, by prescription. The CSA makes it a crime, amongst other things, to possess and use marijuana even for medical reasons. The United States Supreme Court recognized the authority of the United States Federal Government to prohibit marijuana for all purposes even medical ones, despite valid state Laws authorizing the medical use of marijuana. Therefore, even though these certain states authorize the cultivation, distribution, and sale of medical marijuana, this in no way impairs the ability of the United States Federal Government to seek civil and criminal sanctions against any individual or entity that, in any manner contemplated by the CSA, participates in a state legalized marijuana business. Any asserted claim or demand, arising specifically related to any United States Federal Law relating specifically and only to marijuana in any fashion, whether by cultivation, production, distribution, sale or otherwise, by any Person, whether based on contract, tort, implied or express warranty, strict liability criminal or civil statute, ordinance or regulation, common Law or otherwise, relating to or arising out of any of the foregoing matters or issues, including without limitation any enforcement of United States Federal Laws or statutes (and any related administrative rules or regulations), whether now or hereinafter existing, to the extent not consistent with applicable state Laws, is referred herein as an Excluded Federal Claim . The foregoing means that each of the Parties could be subject to civil forfeiture of assets or could face criminal penalties. Additionally, the foregoing means that all of the representations and warranties made herein with respect to compliance with any Law are specifically qualified and limited by the fundamental nature of the Parties business which is not in compliance with Federal Cannabis Laws and, for the avoidance of doubt, no Proceeding may be brought by any Party arising in connection with an Excluded Federal Claim.
