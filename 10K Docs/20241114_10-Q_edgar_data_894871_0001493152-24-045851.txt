Forward-Looking
Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report of The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. (the Company, we, 
 our, and us contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). Forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and include, without limitation, statements concerning
our business strategy, future revenues, market growth, capital requirements, product introductions ,
 expansion plans and the adequacy of our funding and our ability to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern (as described in Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included
in Part 1, Item 1 herein). Other statements contained in this Quarterly Report that are not historical facts are also forward-looking
statements. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, 
 could, should, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, 
 believes, seeks, estimates, and other stylistic variants denoting forward-looking statements. 

We
caution investors that any forward-looking statements presented in this Quarterly Report, or that we may make orally or in writing from
time to time, are based on information currently available, as well as our beliefs and assumptions. The actual outcome related to forward-looking
statements will be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties, and factors that are beyond our control or ability to
predict. Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they are not guarantees of future performance, and some will inevitably
prove to be incorrect. As a result, our actual future results can be expected to differ from our expectations, and those differences
may be material. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based only on known results
and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. We detail other risks in our public filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 and in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors , in this Quarterly
Report. The discussion in this Quarterly Report should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

This
Quarterly Report and all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf
are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We do not undertake
any obligation to release publicly any revisions to our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date
of this Quarterly Report except as may be required by law.

,
and as of September 30, 2024, had cash on hand of and
a working capital deficit of .
Management has evaluated the Company s net loss from continuing operations and working capital deficit to determine if the
significance of those conditions or events would limit its ability to meet its obligations when due, including under the Loan
Documents and Simplify Loan (see Notes 10 and 12). In its evaluation, management determined that
substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the
financial statement issuance date due to the net loss from continued operations and working capital deficit. 

The
Company s financial results have improved in recent periods due to restructuring activities and implementation of a new
operating structure. In addition, the Company plans to continue improving monthly financial performance through the reduction of
costs and monthly cash requirements, maintain compliance with the terms of all outstanding debt agreements, and take actions to
resolve current and potential future liabilities to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern, such as resolving pending litigation. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able
to execute these plans. If the Company is unable to execute these plans, it could lead to selling assets and further reducing costs
and cash requirements.

deferred income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily due to deferred tax liabilities on indefinite
lived intangible assets. 

The
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the generation of future taxable income, the reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies. Based upon the Company s historical operating losses and the uncertainty
of future taxable income, the Company has provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that will not be realized as

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 should be read together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year
ended December 31, 2023 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. The following discussion contains
 forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. Our actual results
may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors.
We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual
results and the differences can be material. Please see Forward-Looking Statements. 

Overview 

We
are a media company that leverages technology to build deep content verticals powered by anchor brands and a best-in-class digital media
platform (the Platform empowering publishers who impact, inform, educate, and entertain. Our strategy is to focus on key
subject matter verticals where audiences are passionate about a topic category (e.g., sports and finance) where we can leverage the strength
of our core brands to grow our audience and increase monetization both within our core brands as well as for our media publisher partners
(each, a Publisher Partner ). Our focus is on leveraging our Platform and brands in targeted verticals to maximize audience
reach, enhance engagement, and optimize monetization of digital publishing assets for the benefit of our users, our advertiser clients,
and our greater than 40 owned and operated properties as well as properties we run on behalf of independent Publisher Partners. We own
and operate Athlon Sports, TheStreet, The Spun, Parade, and Men s Journal and power more than 360 independent Publisher
Partners, including the many sports team sites that contribute to Athlon Sports. 

Each
Publisher Partner joins the Platform by invitation only with the objective of improving our position in key verticals while optimizing
the performance of the Publisher Partner. Publisher Partners incur the costs in content creation on their respective channels and receive
a share of the revenue associated with their content. Because of the state-of-the-art technology and large scale of the Platform and
our expertise in search engine optimization, social media, ad monetization and subscription marketing, Publisher Partners continually
benefit from our ongoing technological advances and audience development expertise. Additionally, we believe the lead brands within our
verticals create a halo benefit for all Publisher Partners while each of them adds to the breadth and quality of content. While the Publisher
Partners benefit from these critical performance improvements they may also save substantial technology, infrastructure, advertising
sales, member marketing and management costs. 

Of
the more than 360 Publisher Partners, a large majority of them publish content within one of our four verticals of sports, finance, lifestyle
and men s lifestyle, and oversee an online community for their respective sites, leveraging our Platform, monetization operation,
distribution channels and data and analytics offerings and benefiting from our ability to engage the collective audiences within a single
network. Generally, Publisher Partners are independently owned, strategic partners who receive a share of revenue from the interaction
with their content. Audiences expand and advertising revenue may improve due to the scale we have achieved by combining all Publisher
Partners into a single platform and a large and experienced sales organization. They also benefit from our membership marketing and management
systems, which we believe will enhance their revenue. 

Our
growth strategy is to continue adding new Publisher Partners in key verticals that management believes will expand the scale of unique
users interacting on the Platform . 

Recent
Developments 

On
July 12, 2024, we entered into a Third Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement Amendment No. 3 ),
pursuant to which interest that was, or will be, due on December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024 will
now be due on or before December 31, 2024, as well as the interest otherwise due on December 31, 2024. The deferral is contingent on,
among other things, no events of default occurring under its Bridge Notes and Debt (both as further described in the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements in Note 10 and Note 11, and referred to as the Loan Documents during the deferral period.
On November 6, 2024, we received a letter from Renew Group Private Limited Renew confirming the Company is not currently
in default under the Loan Documents due to the cure of the default identified in the forbearance letter.

Effective
August 19, 2024, the Business Combination Agreement, dated November 5, 2023, as amended (the Business Combination Agreement ),
among us, Simplify, Bridge Media Networks, LLC, New Arena Holdco, Inc., Energy Merger Sub I, LLC and Energy Merger Sub II, LLC was terminated
by mutual agreement. The Business Combination Agreement was terminated as a result of previously disclosed negotiations between us and
Simplify around alternative structures or options to the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement. We incurred
no penalties as a result of the early termination of the Business Combination Agreement. 

On
August 19, 2024, we entered into the Amended Promissory Note, in connection with an amendment to our March 13, 2024 working capital loan
agreement with Simplify, pursuant to which we have available up to 50,000 (originally 25,000) at ten percent (10.0 interest rate
per annum (the Applicable Interest Rate ), payable monthly in arrears, with a maturity on December 1, 2026 (originally March
13, 2026). In connection with the Amended Promissory Note, on August 19, 2024, we and Simplify also entered into a common stock purchase
agreement (the Common Stock Purchase Agreement ), whereby 15,000 of outstanding indebtedness under the Simplify Loan was
exchanged shares of our common stock. 

Impact
of Macroeconomic Conditions 

Uncertainty
in the global economy presents significant risks to our business. Increases in inflation, instability in the global banking system, geopolitical factors, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and the
responses thereto may have an adverse effect on our business. While we are closely monitoring the impact of the current macroeconomic
conditions on all aspects of our business, the ultimate extent of the impact on our business remains highly uncertain and will depend
on future developments and factors that continue to evolve. Most of these developments and factors are outside of our control and could
exist for an extended period of time. As a result, we are subject to continuing risks and uncertainties. For additional information,
see the sections titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with
the SEC on April 1, 2024 and in this Quarterly Report. 

Key
Operating Metrics 

Our
key operating metrics are: 

Revenue
 per page view RPM represents the advertising revenue earned per 1,000 pageviews. It is calculated as our
 advertising revenue during a period divided by our total page views during that period and multiplied by 1,000; and 

Monthly
 average pageviews represents the total number of pageviews in a given month or the average of each month s pageviews
 in a fiscal quarter or year, which is calculated as the total number of page views recorded in a quarter or year divided by three
 months or 12 months, respectively. 

We
monitor and review our key operating metrics as we believe that these metrics are relevant for our industry and specifically to us and
to understanding our business. Moreover, they form the basis for trends informing certain predictions related to our financial condition.
Our key operating metrics focus primarily on our digital advertising revenue, which has experienced significant growth in recent periods.
As indicated in the Results of Operations section below, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, digital advertising revenue decreased
by approximately 19 , as compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, digital advertising
revenue decreased by approximately 6 , as compared to the same period in 2023. Management monitors and reviews these metrics because
such metrics are readily measurable in real time and can provide valuable insight into the performance of and trends related to our digital
advertising revenue and our overall business. We consider only those key operating metrics described here to be material to our financial
condition, results of operations and future prospects. 

34 

For
pricing indicators, we focus on RPM as it is the pricing metric most closely aligned with monthly average pageviews. RPM is an indicator
of yield and pricing driven by both advertising density and demand from our advertisers. 

Monthly
average pageviews are measured across all properties hosted on the Platform and provide us with insight into volume, engagement and effective
page management and are therefore our primary measure of traffic. We utilize a third-party source, Google Analytics, to confirm this
traffic data. 

As
described above, these key operating metrics are critical for management as they provide insights into our digital advertising revenue
generation and overall business performance. This information also provides feedback on the content on our website and its ability to
attract and engage users, which allows us to make strategic business decisions designed to drive more users to read or view more of our
content and generate higher advertising revenue across all properties hosted on the Platform. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our RPM was 24.69 and 22.27, respectively. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, our RPM was 23.41 and 19.60, respectively. The 5 and 14 increases in RPM for the three and nine months reflect
a significant increase in video advertising as a percentage of total digital advertising as digital video advertising is sold at a significantly
higher price than digital display advertising. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our monthly average pageviews were 301,721,996 and 332,312,606, respectively, as
compared to 388,410,170 and 380,578,813 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 22 and 13 decreases in monthly
average pageviews reflect algorithmic changes at Google, Facebook and other platforms which subdued user click-throughs to the original
content. 

All
dollar figures presented below are in thousands unless otherwise stated. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Going
Concern 

Our
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of 14,880, and as of September 30,
2024, had cash on hand of 5,773 and a working capital deficit of 209,596 .
Management has evaluated our net loss from continuing operations and working capital deficit to determine if the significance
of those conditions or events would limit our ability to meet our obligations when due, including under the Loan Documents and
Simplify Loan (further details are provided in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements in Notes 10 and 12). In our evaluation, management determined that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue
as a going concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date due to the net loss from continued
operations and working capital deficit. 

Our
financial results have improved in recent periods due to restructuring activities and implementation of a new operating structure.
In addition, we plan to continue improving monthly financial performance through the reduction of costs and monthly cash
requirements, maintain compliance with the terms of all outstanding debt agreements, and take actions to resolve current and
potential future liabilities to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern, such as resolving pending litigation. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute these plans. If we
are unable to execute these plans, it could lead to selling assets and further reducing costs and cash
requirements. 

Cash
and Working Capital Facility 

As
of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash of 5,773 and accounts receivable from continuing operations,
net of our allowance for credit losses, of 25,858. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had 48,900 available for additional use
under our working capital loan with Simplify. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of the Simplify working capital loan
was 1,100. Our cash balance as of the issuance date of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements is 7,085. 

35 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Material
Contractual Obligations 

We
have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business primarily consisting of employment contracts, consulting
agreements, leases, liquidated damages, debt and related interest payments. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related
to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. See Notes 5, 8, 10, 11 and
12 in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024, related to leases,
liquidated damages, working capital loan, bridge notes and debt, respectively. During 2022, we assumed the lease from Men s Journal
for office space in Carlsbad, California, that expires in March 2025, and we remain responsible for 720 over the lease term. The lease
provides for fixed payments ranging from 89 to 94 over the remainder of the lease term, with an estimate of common expenses per month
of 25 through the end of the lease term. Other than with respect to leases, as described in Note 5, Leases , in our accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes from the disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Discontinued
Operations 

In
connection with our discontinued operations from the discontinuance of the Sports Illustrated media business, we recorded the termination
fee liability of 45,000 and recognized a loss on impairment of assets of 39,391 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As a
result of this discontinuance, our total liabilities from the discontinued operations were 98,378, partially offset by our total assets
from discontinued operations of 528 as of September 30, 2024. 

Loss
from our discontinued operations, net of tax, was 92,709 and 15,204 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Further
details are provided in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in Note 2, Discontinued Operations, related
to our discontinued operations and Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, regarding our legal matters and an action filed by
ABG Group against the Company and Manoj Bhargava on April 1, 2024.

For

months ended September 30, 2023. This reflected a decrease in print revenue of 1,941 due primarily to the shutdown of Athlon Outdoor
print operations, which was further reduced by a decrease of 4.3 in digital revenue of 1,500, primarily from decreases in our digital
advertising of 5,184, and digital subscriptions of 1,155. 

The
primary driver of the decrease in our digital revenue is an 18.3 decrease in our digital advertising revenue from 28,251 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023 to 23,067 in the current year period. Other digital revenue increased by 5,232 to 6,320 for the three

Change
in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration . The change in fair value of contingent consideration for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 of 313, represents the change in the put option on our common stock in connection with the Fexy Studios acquisition. 

Interest
Expense . We incurred interest expense of 11,747 and 13,225 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
a decrease of 1,478 from the prior period, as a result of interest rate changing. 

Liquidated
Damages . We recorded 229 of accrued interest on our liquidated damages payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily
from the issuance of our convertible debentures, Series H convertible preferred stock, Series I convertible preferred stock, Series J
convertible preferred stock and Series K convertible preferred stock in prior years. We recorded 455 of accrued interest on our liquidated
damages payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily from issuance of the same securities as described above. 

Use
of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

We
report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP 
however, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with useful supplemental
information that enables a better comparison of our performance across periods. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides visibility to the
underlying continuing operating performance by excluding the impact of certain items that are noncash in nature or not related to our
core business operations. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss as adjusted for net loss from discontinued operations, with additional
adjustments for (i) interest expense (net), (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, (v)
change in valuation of contingent consideration; (vi) liquidated damages, (vii) loss on impairment of assets, (viii) employee retention
credit, and (ix) employee restructuring payments. 

Our
non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure used by other companies, has limitations as an analytical
tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Additionally,
we do not consider our non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as superior to, or a substitute for, the equivalent measures calculated and presented
in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA: 

does
 not reflect interest expense, or the cash required to service our debt, which reduces cash available to us; 

does
 not reflect income tax provision, which is a noncash expense; 

does
 not reflect depreciation and amortization expense and, although this is a noncash expense, the assets being depreciated may have
 to be replaced in the future, increasing our cash requirements; 

does
 not reflect stock-based compensation and, therefore, does not include all of our compensation costs; 

does
 not reflect the change in valuation of contingent consideration, and, although this is a noncash income or expense, the change in
 the valuations each reporting period are not impacted by our actual business operations but is instead strongly tied to the change
 in the market value of our common stock; 

does
 not reflect liquidated damages and, therefore, does not include future cash requirements if we repay the liquidated damages in cash
 instead of shares of our common stock (which the investor would need to agree to); 

does
 not reflect any losses from the impairment of assets, which is a noncash operating expense; 

does
 not reflect the employee retention credits recorded by us for payroll related tax credits under the CARES Act; and 

does
 not reflect payments related to employee severance and employee restructuring changes for our former executives.

 4,169 

(1) Interest
 expense is related to our capital structure and varies over time due to a variety of financing
 transactions. Interest expense includes 30 and 533 for amortization of debt discounts for
 the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as presented in our condensed
 consolidated statements of cash flows, which are noncash items. Interest expense includes
 626 and 2,178 for amortization of debt discounts for the nine months ended September 30,
 2024 and 2023, respectively. Investors should note that interest expense will recur in future
 periods. 
 
 (2) Depreciation
 and amortization related to our developed technology and Platform is included within cost
 of revenues of 1,474 and 2,191 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
 respectively, and depreciation and amortization is included within operating expenses of
 905 and 1,055 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Depreciation
 and amortization related to our developed technology and Platform is included within cost
 of revenues of 4,530 and 6,883 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
 and depreciation and amortization is included within operating expenses of 2,805 and 3,216
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We believe (i) the
 amount of depreciation and amortization expense in any specific period may not directly correlate
 to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary
 significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions and full amortization of previously
 acquired tangible and intangible assets. Investors should note that the use of tangible and
 intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods presented and will contribute to
 future revenue generation and should also note that such expense will recur in future periods. 
 
 (3) Stock-based
 compensation represents noncash costs arise from the grant of stock-based awards to employees,
 consultants and directors. We believe that excluding the effect of stock-based compensation
 from Adjusted EBITDA assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons
 in our operating performance because (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period
 may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations, and
 (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants
 of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection with acquisitions. Additionally,
 we believe that excluding stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA assists management
 and investors in making meaningful comparisons between our operating performance and the
 operating performance of other companies that may use different forms of employee compensation
 or different valuation methodologies for their stock-based compensation. Investors should
 note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees whose efforts
 contributed to the operating results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute
 to operating results in future periods. Investors should also note that such expenses will
 recur in the future. 

(4) Change
 in fair value of contingent consideration represents the change in the put option on our
 common stock in connection with the Fexy Studios acquisition. 
 
 (5) Liquidated
 damages (or interest expense related to accrued liquidated damages) represents amounts we
 owe to certain of our investors in private placements offerings conducted in fiscal years
 2018 through 2020, pursuant to which we agreed to certain covenants in the respective securities
 purchase agreements and registration rights agreements, including the filing of resale registration
 statements and becoming current in our reporting obligations, which we were not able to timely
 meet. 
 
 (6) Loss
 on impairment of assets represents certain assets that are no longer useful. 
 
 (7) Employee
 retention credit represents payroll related tax credits under the CARES Act. 
 
 (8) Employee
 restructuring payments represents severance payments to employees under employer restructuring
 arrangements and payments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
 respectively.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements,
we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders equity, revenue, expenses,
and related disclosures. We re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual
results may differ from these estimates and could differ based upon other assumptions or conditions. 

Except
as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements
in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and
estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023 that was filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

See
Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in
Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted as of the date of this
report. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not
applicable to a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of SEC Regulation S-K. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer(s) and principal financial officer(s), or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of September 30, 2024 in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

The
effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including
the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate
misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any
system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable,
not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our
business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial
reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may be subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Except as described in Note 19,
 Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are not currently subject to any pending or threatened legal proceedings that we believe would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

There
are numerous factors that affect our business and operating results, many of which are beyond our control. The risk factors described
in Part I, Item IA. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the
SEC on April 1, 2024 should be carefully considered, together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with SEC in connection with evaluating us, our business and the forward-looking
statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us at present, or that we
currently deem immaterial, may affect us. The occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. All dollar figures presented below are in thousands unless otherwise
stated. 

Our
license agreement to operate the Sports Illustrated media business was terminated by the licensor, which may materially harm our business,
operating results and financial condition. 

As
alleged in ABG s notice of termination, ABG claims that we failed to make a quarterly payment due to ABG pursuant to the Licensing
Agreement of 3,750, on January 18, 2024, ABG notified us of the termination of the Licensing Agreement, effective immediately, in accordance
with its rights under the Licensing Agreement. As stated in the notice of termination, ABG believes that a fee of 45,000 became immediately
due and payable by us to ABG pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Licensing Agreement. In addition, upon termination of the Licensing
Agreement, all outstanding and unvested warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued to ABG in connection with the Licensing
Agreement became immediately vested and exercisable. 

On
March 18, 2024, ABG announced it had reached an agreement in principle with a third party to become the new operator of the Sports
Illustrated media business. On April 1, 2024, ABG Group filed an action against us and Manoj Bhargava, the former interim CEO of the
Company and a principal stockholder, alleging, among other things, breach of contract in the United States District Court of the
Southern District of New York seeking damages in the amount of 48,750 3,750 royalty fee liability and 45,000 termination fee
liability as reflected in current liabilities from discontinued operations). On June 7, 2024, we filed a response denying ABG
Group s alleged breach of contract action and filed a counterclaim against ABG Group and Minute Media, Inc. alleging, among
other things, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, unjust enrichment, breach of contract and tortious interference
with contract. On August 2, 2024, ABG Group filed an amended complaint which we responded to on August 22, 2024 and subsequently
filed counterclaims against ABG Group and Sportority, Inc. d/b/a Minute Media. A settlement conference is scheduled for December 4,
2024. 

The
loss of the rights to operate the SI Business, in addition to the alleged and disputed termination payments that are due following termination
of the Licensing Agreement, could harm our competitiveness in our industry, damage any goodwill we may have generated, and otherwise
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Any subsequent rebranding efforts we may undertake
may require significant resources and expenses and may affect our ability to attract and retain customers, all of which may have a material
adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects. 

47 

We
defaulted on certain covenants included in our debt agreements that could result in the acceleration of the related debt or the exercise
of other remedies. 

On
December 29, 2023, we failed to make the interest payment due pursuant to the Loan Documents in the amount of 2,797,
resulting in a default under the Loan Documents. On January 5, 2024, we entered into the forbearance letter (as updated from
time-to-time the forbearance letter with Renew, the lender under the Loan Documents, pursuant to which
Renew agreed to a forbearance period through March 29, 2024, subsequently extended to September 30, 2024, while reserving its rights
and remedies. 

The
default under the Loan Documents, as well as Arena s alleged failure to make a quarterly payment due to ABG pursuant to the
Licensing Agreement, resulted in an Event of Default under the Arena Credit Agreement with SLR. On March 13, 2024, Arena entered
into the Loan Documents, with Simplify which provided for up to 25,000 of borrowings to be used for working capital and general
corporate purposes. Upon the closing of the Simplify Loan (as further described in Note 12, Simplify Loan , in our
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements), Arena borrowed 7,748, of which 3,448 was used to repay the outstanding
loan balance, accrued interest, certain fees and contingency reserves under the Arena Credit Agreement. On August 19, 2024, we
entered into the Amended Promissory Note which increased available borrowings to 50,000 and extended the maturity date of the
promissory note to December 1, 2026 (as further described in Note 12, Simplify Loan, in our accompanying condensed financial
statements). On July 12, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 which further deferred the accrued interest due date to December 31,
2024 (as further described under the heading Loan Documents in Note 18). On November 6, 2024, we received a letter from Renew
confirming we are not currently in default under the Loan Documents due to the default identified in the forbearance letter (as
further described under the heading Update to Renew Forbearance in Note 20). The outstanding principal on the Loan Documents
was 110,691 as of September 30, 2024. The indirect owner of Renew also has an indirect non-controlling interest in
Simplify. 

Borrowings
under the Loan Documents are secured by substantially all of our assets. Upon an event of default, Renew can declare all outstanding
borrowings under the Loan Documents, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition,
Simplify could declare all outstanding borrowings under the Loan Documents together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees,
to be immediately due and payable and, subject to the terms of the intercreditor agreement between Renew and Simplify, foreclose on our
assets. Any of these actions would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations and
could lead to selling assets, cutting costs, reducing cash requirements, filing bankruptcy or ceasing operations. 

The
market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.

The
digital media industry is fragmented and highly competitive. There are many players in the digital media market, many with greater name
recognition and financial resources, which may give them a competitive advantage. The general business of online media, combined with
some level or method of leveraging community attracts many potential entrants, and in the future, there may be strong competitors that
will compete with us in general or in selected markets. These and other companies may be better financed and be able to develop their
markets more quickly and penetrate those markets more effectively. We expect competition to intensify in the future. All of this could
adversely affect our revenues and operating results. 

Our
financial condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through one year from the
date of the issuance of the financial statements contained herein if we are unable to rectify the recurrence of our net losses and reduce
our working deficit. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of 14,880, and as of September 30, 2024,
had cash on hand of 5,773 and a working capital deficit of 209,596. Management has evaluated our net loss from continuing operations and working capital deficit to determine if the significance of those conditions or events would limit our ability to meet our
obligations when due, including under the Loan Documents and Simplify Loan. In its evaluation, management determined that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going
concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date due to the net loss from continued operations and working capital deficit. 

48 

O ur 
financial results have improved in recent periods due to restructuring activities and implementation of a new operating structure.
In addition, we plan to continue
improving monthly financial performance through the reduction of costs and monthly cash requirements, maintain compliance with the
terms of all outstanding debt agreements, and take actions to resolve current and potential future liabilities to alleviate the
conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, such as resolving pending litigation.
However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute these plans. If we are unable to execute these plans, it could
lead to selling assets and further reducing costs and cash requirements. 

Cyber-attacks
and other security threats and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

As
a tech-powered media company, we face cybersecurity threats, such as ransomware and denial-of-service, and attacks on technical infrastructure.
Our customers and suppliers face similar cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident impacting us or any of these entities could
materially adversely affect our operations, performance and results of operations. 

The
sophistication of threats continues to evolve and grow, including the risk associated with the use of emerging technologies, such as
artificial intelligence and quantum computing, for nefarious purposes. In addition to cybersecurity threats, we face threats to the security
of our systems and employees from terrorist acts, sabotage or other disruptions, any of which could adversely affect our business. The
improper conduct of our employees or others working on behalf of us who have access to confidential or sensitive information could also
adversely affect our business and reputation. Our customers (including sites that we operate for our customers) and suppliers experience
similar security threats. 

If
we are unable to protect sensitive information, including complying with evolving information security, data protection and privacy regulations,
our customers or governmental authorities could investigate the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures;
and could bring actions against us for noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. Moreover, depending on the severity of an
incident, our customers data, our employees data, our intellectual property (including trade secrets and research, development
and engineering know-how), and other third party data (such as suppliers) could be compromised, which could adversely affect our business.
Products and services we provide to customers also carry cybersecurity risks, including risks that they could be breached or fail to
detect, prevent or combat attacks, which could result in losses to our customers and claims against us, and could harm our relationships
with our customers and financial results. 

Given
the persistence, sophistication, volume and novelty of threats we face, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating an attack
that could have a material adverse effect on us and the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully
insured or indemnified by other means. 

Our
suppliers face similar security threats and an incident at one of these entities could adversely impact our business. These entities
are typically outside our control and may have access to our information with varying levels of security and cybersecurity resources,
expertise, safeguards and capabilities. Adversaries actively seek to exploit security and cybersecurity weaknesses in our supply chain.
Breaches in our supply chain could in the future compromise our data and adversely affect customer deliverables. We also must rely on
our supply chain for adequately detecting and reporting cyber incidents, which could affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity
incidents effectively or in a timely manner. Failures by our suppliers could result in damages to you and have an adverse effect on our
business and operations. 

We
are currently out of compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE American. Our failure to regain compliance with the
continued listing standards may result in the delisting of our common stock. 

Our
common stock is listed on the NYSE American and such listing is contingent on our compliance with the NYSE American s
standards for continued listing, including requirements relating to maintaining minimum stockholders equity. On October 2,
2024, we received a notification Letter from the NYSE American stating that we are not in compliance with the
minimum stockholders equity requirements of Sections 1003(a)(i), 1003(a)(ii) and 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American Company
Guide (the Company Guide requiring stockholders equity of (i) 2.0 million or more if we have reported losses
from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years, (ii) 4.0 million or more if we have
reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of the four most recent fiscal years and (iii) 6.0 million or
more if we have reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years, respectively. As
of June 30, 2024, we had a stockholders deficit of 157.2 million and has had losses in the most recent five fiscal years
ended December 31, 2023. 

49 

As
a result of this non-compliance, we became subject to the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 1009 of the Company Guide
and had until November 1, 2024 to submit a plan (the Plan of actions we have taken or will take to regain compliance
with the continued listing standards by April 2, 2026, which is 18-months from receipt of the Letter Cure Period ).
The Plan we submitted on November 1, 2024 is under review by the NYSE American as of the date of filing. If the NYSE
American accepts the Plan, we will be able to continue our NYSE American listing during the Plan period and will be subject to
periodic reviews including quarterly monitoring for compliance with the Plan until we have regained compliance. If the Plan is not
accepted by the NYSE American, the Letter states that delisting proceedings will commence. We may appeal a staff delisting
determination in accordance with Section 1010 and Part 12 of the Company Guide. 

We
intend to regain compliance and the Letter has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our common stock on the NYSE American
and if the Plan is approved and adhered to, during the Cure Period. Our receipt of the Letter from the NYSE American does not affect
our business, operations or reporting requirements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Although
we intend to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements prior to the end of the Cure Period, we may be unable to do so.
If delisting proceedings are commenced, the NYSE American rules permit us to appeal a staff delisting determination; however, there can
be no assurance that the outcome of any such appeal would be in our favor. 

If
NYSE American delists our common stock from trading on its exchange due to our failure to meet the NYSE American s continued listing
standards, we and our security holders could face significant material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of
trading market for our common stock, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our common stock and an inability for us to obtain
additional financing to fund our operations.
