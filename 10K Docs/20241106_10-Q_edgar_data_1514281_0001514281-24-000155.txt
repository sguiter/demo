The Company conducts its business through reportable segment, Loans and Securities, which reflects how the Company manages its business and analyzes and reports its results of operations. 
 
 The Company was incorporated in the state of Maryland on March 1, 2011 and commenced operations in July 2011. The Company conducts its operations to qualify and be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Company is externally managed by AG REIT Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Manager"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Angelo, Gordon Co., L.P. ("TPG Angelo Gordon"), a diversified credit and real estate investing platform within TPG Inc. ("TPG"). The Manager has delegated to TPG Angelo Gordon the overall responsibility of its day-to-day duties and obligations arising under the management agreement. 
 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 WMC Acquisition 
 
 On December 6, 2023 (the "Closing Date"), the Company completed its acquisition of WMC, a Delaware corporation. WMC was an externally managed mortgage REIT that focused on investing in, financing and managing a portfolio of residential mortgage loans, real estate related securities, and commercial real estate loans. On the Closing Date, WMC merged with and into AGMIT Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company (the "Merger"). As contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 8, 2023 (the "Merger Agreement"), the certificate of merger was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and the Merger was effective at 8:15 a.m., Eastern Time, on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time"). 
 
 Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding share of WMC common stock, par value per share ("WMC Common Stock"), was converted into the right to receive the following (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"): (i) from MITT, shares of MITT common stock; and (ii) from the Manager, a cash amount equal to (the "Per Share Additional Manager Consideration"). No fractional shares of MITT common stock were issued in the Merger, and the value of any fractional interests to which a former holder of WMC Common Stock was otherwise entitled was paid in cash. 
 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the amount of the Per Share Additional Manager Consideration was reduced by the smallest amount (rounded to the nearest cent) necessary to cause the Per Share Additional Manager Consideration to be less than 10 of the total value of the Per Share Merger Consideration received by a holder of WMC Common Stock under the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the previously disclosed amendment to the Company's management agreement, dated as of August 8, 2023, by and between MITT and the Manager (the "MITT Management Agreement Amendment"), which became effective on the Closing Date and amends the existing management agreement, dated as of June 29, 2011 (as amended, the "Existing MITT Management Agreement"), (i) the Manager will waive its right to seek reimbursement from MITT for any expenses otherwise reimbursable by MITT under the Existing MITT Management Agreement in an amount equal to approximately million, which is the excess of million over the aggregate Per Share Additional Manager Consideration paid by the Manager to the holders of WMC Common Stock under the Merger Agreement, and (ii) the Manager s base management fee will be reduced by million for the first quarters following the Effective Time, beginning with the fiscal quarter in which the Effective Time occurred (i.e., resulting in an aggregate million waiver of base management fees). 
 
 Additionally, each outstanding share of WMC s restricted common stock and each WMC restricted stock unit (each, a "WMC Equity Award") vested in full immediately prior to the Effective Time and, as of the Effective Time, was considered outstanding for all purposes of the Merger Agreement, including the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, except that WMC Equity Awards granted to certain members of the WMC board of directors at WMC s 2023 annual stockholders meeting (collectively, the "2023 WMC Director Awards") were treated as follows: (i) for M. Christian Mitchell and Lisa G. Quateman, who were appointed to the MITT board of directors as of the Effective Time, the 2023 WMC Director

 million shares of MITT common stock were issued to former WMC common stockholders and, following the consummation of the Merger, former WMC common stockholders owned approximately of the common equity of MITT. 
 
 Purchase Price Allocation 
 
 The Company completed the WMC acquisition on December 6, 2023 to support continued growth of the Company and to create efficiency and scale for stockholders. The Company accounted for this transaction in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, "Business Combinations" using the acquisition method of accounting , which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.

 (1) For time-based restricted stock units granted by WMC that fully vested as of the Closing Date, the fair value of the Company s common stock issued in the satisfaction of these units was included in equity consideration transferred as no post acquisition service was required.

 billion. 
 
 The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed required the use of significant assumptions and estimates. Critical estimates included, but were not limited to, future expected cash flows related to these assets and liabilities and the applicable discount rates. These estimates were based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. The assessment of fair value is based on information that was available to management at the time the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Those estimates and assumptions are subject to change as management obtains additional information related to those estimates during the applicable measurement period. The final determination must occur within one year of the acquisition date. 
 
 Under the acquisition method of accounting, merger-related transaction costs (such as advisory, legal, valuation, and other professional fees) are not included as components of consideration transferred but are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. The Company incurred transaction costs of million and million during the third and fourth quarters of 2023, respectively, which were included in the "Transaction related expenses" line item in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 At acquisition, the Company recognized a bargain purchase gain of million which was separately recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The bargain purchase gain represents the amount by which the fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition exceeds the fair value of the shares of MITT common stock issued as consideration at the Effective Time. As a result of macroeconomic factors and interest rate volatility, the prices per share of common stock of certain companies within the mortgage REIT industry have traded at discounts to book values per share in recent periods, which contributed to the bargain purchase gain recorded on the WMC acquisition.

 The Company s residential mortgage loan portfolio consists of mortgage loans on residential real estate located throughout the United States. 
 
 New York Florida Texas New Jersey 

Variable interest entities 
 
 The Company enters into securitization transactions collateralized by its Non-Agency Loans/Agency-Eligible Loans and re- and non-performing loans, which are considered VIEs. The Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary of certain VIEs and, as a result, consolidated the assets and liabilities of the VIEs on its consolidated balance sheets. In a securitization transaction, a pool of loans is transferred to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the loans are deposited into a newly created securitization trust. The securitization trust issues various classes of mortgage pass-through certificates backed by the cash flows from the underlying residential mortgage loans (the "Certificates"). As the sponsor of the securitization, the Company retains certain Certificates issued by the securitization trusts in order to satisfy risk retention rules, which generally require the sponsor to retain at least of the fair value of the Certificates issued in the securitization . The Company's continuing involvement in these securitizations represents its retained Certificates and the ability to purchase all of the outstanding Certificates upon the occurrence of certain events through an optional redemption right held by the Company. The Company has also engaged a related party of the Manager and direct subsidiary of TPG Angelo Gordon to act as the servicing administrator of certain securitization trusts.

 million and million, respectively, that can be used to offset future taxable ordinary income and reduce its REIT distribution requirements. These NOL carryforwards (which exclude NOLs acquired from WMC) do not have an expiration date and can be carried forward indefinitely. In connection with the Merger, the Company obtained NOL carryforwards of million, of which million do not have an expiration date and can be carried forward indefinitely. However, the Company s use of these obtained NOLs is limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had estimated net capital loss ("NCL") carryforwards of million and million, respectively, the majority of which were generated during the year ended December 31, 2020 and will expire in 2025. These NCL carryforwards (which exclude the NCLs acquired from WMC) can be utilized to offset future net gains from the sale of capital assets. In connection with the Merger, the Company obtained NCL carryforwards of million, of which a majority expire between 2027 and 2028. However, the Company s use of these obtained NCLs is limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 
 Taxable REIT Subsidiaries 
 
 The Company elected to treat certain domestic subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"). The Company s financial results are generally not expected to reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes, except for any activities conducted through one or more TRSs that are subject to corporate income taxation. Currently, the Company has wholly owned domestic TRSs that are taxable as corporations and subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income tax on net income at the applicable corporate rates. The federal statutory rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 21 . The Company s effective tax rate differs from its combined U.S. federal, state, and local corporate statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned at the REIT, which is not subject to tax, due to the deduction for qualifying distributions made by the Company, and any change in the valuation allowance as disclosed in further detail below. The tax expense attributable to its TRSs is recorded in the "Non-investment related expenses" line item on the consolidated statement of operations. 

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes at the TRS level. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million and million, respectively, relating to net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, and basis differences of certain investments held within TRSs. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which temporary differences become deductible. The Company concluded it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will not be realized and established a full valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Uncertain Income Tax Positions 
 
 Based on its analysis of any potential uncertain income tax positions, the Company concluded it did not have any uncertain tax positions that meet the recognition or measurement criteria of ASC 740 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company s federal income tax returns for the last three tax years are open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. There are no ongoing U.S. federal, state or local tax examinations related to the Company. In the event that the Company incurs income tax related interest and penalties, its policy is to classify them as a component of provision for income taxes. The Company did t incur any interest or penalties during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Stockholders Equity, for purposes of calculating the management fee, could be greater or less than the amount of stockholders equity shown on the Company s financial statements. 

(1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Manager agreed to waive its right to receive management fees of million and million, respectively, pursuant to the MITT Management Agreement Amendment executed in connection with the Merger.

Our company 
 
 We are a residential mortgage REIT with a focus on investing in a diversified risk-adjusted portfolio of residential mortgage-related assets in the U.S. mortgage market. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over the long-term, primarily through dividends and capital appreciation. 
 
 We focus our investment activities primarily on acquiring and securitizing newly-originated residential mortgage loans within the non-agency segment of the housing market. We obtain our assets through Arc Home, LLC ("Arc Home"), our residential mortgage loan originator in which we own an approximate 44.6 interest, and through other third-party origination partners. We finance our acquired loans through various financing lines on a short-term basis and utilize TPG Angelo Gordon's proprietary securitization platform to secure long-term, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market financing as market conditions permit. Through our ownership in Arc Home, we also have exposure to mortgage banking activities. Arc Home is a multi-channel licensed mortgage originator and servicer primarily engaged in the business of originating and selling residential mortgage loans. 
 
 On December 6, 2023, we acquired Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation, an externally managed mortgage REIT that focused on investing in, financing and managing a portfolio of residential mortgage loans, real estate related securities, and commercial real estate loans. Through this acquisition, we increased our investment portfolio by 1.2 billion, which primarily consisted of Securitized Non-Agency Loans. For more information, refer to the "WMC Acquisition" section below. 
 
 Our investment portfolio (which excludes our ownership in Arc Home) primarily includes Residential Investments and Agency RMBS. Currently, our Residential Investments primarily consist of newly originated Non-Agency Loans, Agency-Eligible Loans, and Home Equity Loans, which we refer to as our target assets. In addition, we may also invest in other types of residential mortgage loans and other mortgage related assets. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted of the following Residential Investments and Agency RMBS: 
 
 Asset Class Description Residential Investments Non-Agency Loans (1) 
 Non-Agency Loans are loans that do not conform to the underwriting guidelines of a government-sponsored enterprise ("GSE"). Non-Agency Loans consist of Qualified mortgage loans ("QM Loans") and Non-Qualified mortgage loans ("Non-QM Loans"). QM Loans are residential mortgage loans that comply with the Ability-To-Repay rules and related guidelines of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. 
 Agency-Eligible Loans (1) 
 Agency-Eligible Loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with GSE guidelines and are primarily secured by investment properties, but are not guaranteed by a GSE. Although these loans are underwritten in accordance with GSE guidelines and can be delivered to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we include these loans within our Non-Agency securitizations. 
 Home Equity Loans (1) 
 Home Equity Loans are revolving lines of credit or closed-end loans secured primarily by a second lien on a residential mortgaged property which provide borrowers access to the equity in their home without the need to pay off their existing mortgage. Home Equity Loans that are structured as revolving lines of credit generally have an initial draw period of 3 to 5 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 25-year amortizing loans. 
 Re- and Non-Performing Loans (1) 
 Performing, re-performing, and non-performing loans are residential mortgage loans collateralized by a first lien mortgaged property. 
 Non-Agency RMBS (2) 
 Non-Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities ("RMBS") represent fixed- and floating- rate RMBS issued by entities other than U.S. GSEs or agencies of the U.S. government. 
 Agency RMBS (2) 
 Agency RMBS represent interests in pools of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by a GSE such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or an agency of the U.S. Government such as Ginnie Mae. 
 
 (1) These investments are included in the "Securitized residential mortgage loans, at fair value" or "Residential mortgage loans, at fair value" line items on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 (2) These investments are included in the "Real estate securities, at fair value" line item on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 50 

In addition, our investment portfolio includes commercial loans, commercial-mortgage backed securities ("CMBS") and other securities (collectively, the "Legacy WMC Commercial Investments") that were acquired in the WMC acquisition. The Legacy WMC commercial loans primarily include first lien commercial mortgage loan participations and are included in the "Commercial loans, at fair value" line item on the consolidated balance sheets. The Legacy WMC CMBS primarily include fixed-rate and floating-rate CMBS, secured by, or evidencing an ownership interest in, a single commercial mortgage loan or a pool of commercial mortgage loans, and are included in the "Real estate securities, at fair value" line item on the consolidated balance sheets. We expect to either hold the Legacy WMC Commercial Investments until maturity or opportunistically exit these investments. 
 
 Our primary sources of income are net interest income from our investment portfolio, changes in the fair value of our investments, and income from our investment in Arc Home. Net interest income consists of the interest income we earn on investments less the interest expense we incur on borrowed funds and any costs or benefits related to hedging. Income from our investment in Arc Home is generated through its mortgage banking activities which represents the origination and subsequent sale of residential mortgage loans and servicing income sourced from its portfolio of mortgage servicing rights. 
 
 We were incorporated in Maryland on March 1, 2011 and commenced operations in July 2011. We conduct our operations to qualify and be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders as long as we maintain our intended qualification as a REIT, with the exception of business conducted in our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs") which are subject to corporate income tax. We also operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. 
 
 WMC Acquisition 
 
 On December 6, 2023, (the "Closing Date") we completed our acquisition of WMC. On the Closing Date, WMC merged with and into AGMIT Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our wholly owned subsidiary ("Merger Sub"), with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company (the "Merger"). As contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 8, 2023 (the Merger Agreement ), the certificate of merger was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and the Merger was effective at 8:15 a.m., Eastern Time, on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time"). 
 
 Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding share of WMC common stock, par value 0.01 per share WMC Common Stock ), was converted into the right to receive the following (the Per Share Merger Consideration ): (i) from us, 1.498 shares of our common stock; and (ii) from our Manager, a cash amount equal to 0.92 (the Per Share Additional Manager Consideration ). No fractional shares of our common stock were issued in the Merger, and the value of any fractional interests to which a former holder of WMC Common Stock was otherwise entitled was paid in cash. 
 
 In addition, on August 8, 2023, we and our Manager entered into an amendment (the MITT Management Agreement Amendment to our existing management agreement, pursuant to which (i) the base management fee will be reduced by 0.6 million for the first four quarters following the Effective Time, beginning with the fiscal quarter in which the Effective Time occurs (i.e., resulting in an aggregate 2.4 million waiver of base management fees), and (ii) our Manager will waive its right to seek reimbursement from us for any expenses otherwise reimbursable by us under the management agreement in an amount equal to approximately 1.3 million, which is the excess of 7.0 million over the aggregate Per Share Additional Manager Consideration paid by our Manager to the holders of WMC Common Stock under the Merger Agreement. 
 
 Additionally, each outstanding share of WMC s restricted common stock and each WMC restricted stock unit (each, a WMC Equity Award vested in full immediately prior to the Effective Time and, as of the Effective Time, was considered outstanding for all purposes of the Merger Agreement, including the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, except that WMC Equity Awards granted to certain members of the WMC board of directors at WMC s 2023 annual stockholders meeting (collectively, the 2023 WMC Director Awards were treated as follows: (i) for M. Christian Mitchell and Lisa G. Quateman, who were appointed to our Board of Directors as of the Effective Time, the 2023 WMC Director Awards were equitably adjusted effective as of the Effective Time into awards relating to shares of our common stock that have the same value, vesting terms and other terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding WMC restricted stock units immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) for the other members of the WMC board of directors, the 2023 WMC Director Awards accelerated and vested pro-rata effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time based on a fraction, the numerator of which was 166 (the number of days between the grant date and the Closing Date) and the denominator of which was 365, and the remaining unvested portion of such 2023 WMC Director Awards was cancelled without any consideration. 
 
 51 

The issuance of shares of our common stock to the former stockholders of WMC was registered under the Securities Act, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-274319), as amended, filed by MITT with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and declared effective on September 29, 2023 (the Registration Statement ). The joint proxy statement/prospectus included in the Registration Statement contains additional information about the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. 
 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, approximately 9.2 million shares of our common stock were issued in connection with the Merger to former WMC common stockholders, and former WMC common stockholders owned approximately 31 of the common equity of MITT as the combined company following the consummation of the Merger. 
 
 Our Manager and TPG Angelo Gordon 
 
 We are externally managed by AG REIT Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Manager"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of TPG Angelo Gordon, a diversified credit and real estate investing platform within TPG Inc. ("TPG"). TPG (Nasdaq: TPG) is a leading global alternative asset management firm. 
 
 On November 1, 2023, TPG completed the previously announced acquisition of TPG Angelo Gordon (the "TPG Transaction"), pursuant to which TPG Angelo Gordon, including our Manager, became indirect subsidiaries of TPG. Pursuant to the management agreement with our Manager, the closing of the TPG Transaction resulted in an assignment of the management agreement. The independent directors of our Board of Directors unanimously consented to such assignment on July 31, 2023 in advance of the TPG Transaction closing. There were no changes to the management agreement in connection with the TPG Transaction and the assignment of the management agreement became effective upon the closing of the TPG Transaction. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of our management agreement, our Manager provides us with our management team, including our officers, along with appropriate support personnel. All of our officers are employees of TPG Angelo Gordon or its affiliates. We do not have any employees. Our Manager is at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of our Board of Directors and has only such functions and authority as our Board of Directors delegates to it. Our Manager has delegated to TPG Angelo Gordon the overall responsibility with respect to our Manager s day-to-day duties and obligations arising under our management agreement. TPG Angelo Gordon is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. 
 
 Through our relationship with our Manager, we benefit from the expertise and relationships that TPG Angelo Gordon has established which provides us with resources to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. Our management has significant experience in the mortgage industry and expertise in structured credit investments. We are able to leverage our Manager, along with our ownership interest in Arc Home, a vertically integrated origination platform, to access investment opportunities in the non-agency residential mortgage loan market. This strategic advantage has enabled us to grow our investment portfolio and remain active in the securitization markets, utilizing TPG Angelo Gordon's proprietary securitization platform to deliver non-agency investments to a diverse mix of investors. 
 
 Market Conditions 
 
 The financial markets have been, and will likely continue to remain, volatile given the overall market uncertainty related to inflation, the U.S. presidential election, and the path of monetary policy and interest rates. Throughout 2024, markets have displayed a high level of sensitivity to the Federal Reserve s interest rate decisions. On September 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 50 basis points to 4.75 to 5.00 , the first decline in four years. The Federal Reserve noted that the decrease was supported by greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 with the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals being roughly in balance. As of September 2024, the Consumer Price Index report indicated inflation was 2.4 year over year with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.1 . During the third quarter, the 10-year U.S. treasury yield decreased by approximately 62 basis points to 3.79 and the 30-year mortgage rate decreased by approximately 78 basis points to 6.1 . The quarter ended with the spread between the 2-year and 10-year U.S. treasury yields at approximately 14 basis points positive sloping, re-establishing a normal yield curve. Despite the decline in benchmark and mortgage rates during the third quarter, this momentum reversed in the months of October and November. Upon the Republican party winning the U.S. presidential election, stock markets experienced notable increases, the U.S. dollar strengthened, and benchmark rates increased continuing the themes of market uncertainty and volatility which could impact our industry. The latest Federal Open Market Committee member median projection for the path of the Federal Funds Rate indicates 50 basis points of further rate cuts across the remaining two Federal Open Market Committee meetings this year followed by 100 basis points of rate cuts in 2025. Overall, the Federal Reserve continues to monitor available economic data to determine if they will continue rate cuts and to what extent rates will decline. 
 
 52 

RMBS spreads continued to tighten during the third quarter, and credit curves remained relatively flat. Pricing dynamics have been supported by strong investor interest for mortgage credit assets given high quality underwriting, rising home values and low housing supply. Trends in credit spreads on credit risk transfer ("CRT") assets can serve as a proxy for market participants evaluating credit related assets given the observability of transactions. CRT tranches tightened by 10 to 35 basis points. Senior and mezzanine (BBB) Non-QM tranches tightened by 5 basis points, while the subordinate BB rated tranches tightened by 20 basis points. 
 
 Primary RMBS market activity increased during the third quarter, totaling approximately 36 billion, an increase of 7 quarter-over-quarter and 88 against year-ago activity. The Non-QM sector 11 billion) and Prime Jumbo sector 8 billion) collectively comprised over half of the quarter s new issuance. Additionally, issuance of RMBS backed by second liens and Home Equity Loans held steady, totaling over 3 billion, or 9 of the quarter s activity, as focus has shifted to this rapidly expanding sector. Residential Transition Loan RMBS totaled over 1.9 billion or 5 of third quarter issuance as well. Year-to-date, primary RMBS activity is just below 100 billion, surpassing all of 2023. 
 
 The rise in the S P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index persisted through July 2024. The Index was higher by 5 both year-to-date and year-over-year, but regionally, home price performance has been somewhat varied. Amid the rise in actual home prices, national home price expectations from third party research has generally reset higher with the average of the 2024 forecasts now approximating +3.5 and an average forecast for 2025 of +3 . 
 
 Prevailing mortgage rates fell sharply in the third quarter near 6 before rebounding to 6.4 in mid-October. Rates rose back above 7 during the second quarter of 2024 but descended quickly in August and September, according to Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey. The effective mortgage rate outstanding was 3.92 as of June 2024, the latest data available, and remains well below prevailing rates. However, the lock-in effect, or disincentive for existing homeowners to sell their homes because their current mortgage rate is well below current market rates, is starting to show signs of decay as the effective mortgage rate has risen approximately 60 basis points since March 2022. 
 
 Total existing home listings continued to rise to 1.35 million in August, the highest reading since the fourth quarter of 2020. However, new listings are trending short of annual activity in 2015 through 2019, as well as the pandemic-affected years of 2020 through 2022. From January 1, 2024 through August of 2024, approximately 3.1 million new listings came to market, almost 900 thousand fewer new listings than the same periods in 2015 through 2022.

 Results of Operations 
 
 Our operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on the size and composition of our investment portfolio, the level of our net interest income, the fair value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, our investments in residential mortgage loans in the marketplace, among other things, which can be impacted by unanticipated credit events, such as defaults, liquidations or delinquencies, experienced by borrowers whose residential mortgage loans are included in our investment portfolio and other unanticipated events in our markets. Our primary source of net income or loss available to common stockholders is our net interest income, inclusive of our cost or benefit of hedging, which represents the difference between the interest earned on our investment portfolio and the costs of financing and economic hedges in place on our investment portfolio, as well as any income or losses from our equity investments in affiliates.

 Interest income 
 
 Interest income is calculated using the effective interest method for our GAAP investment portfolio. 
 
 Interest income increased from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of an increased investment portfolio resulting from the WMC acquisition in December 2023 along with purchases of residential mortgage loans during the period and an increase in the weighted average yield of our investment portfolio.

Interest expense 
 
 Interest expense is inclusive of our financing cost related to our financing arrangements on our GAAP investment portfolio, securitized debt, Legacy WMC Convertible Notes, and Senior Unsecured Notes. 
 
 Interest expense increased from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in the GAAP financing balance outstanding resulting from the assumption of financing through the WMC acquisition in December 2023 along with the issuance of securitized debt and Senior Unsecured Notes during the period. Additionally, there was an increase in the weighted average financing rate. The following table presents a summary of the weighted average financing balance and the weighted average financing rate on our GAAP investment portfolio in millions).

 Management fee to affiliate 
 
 Our management fee is based upon a percentage of our Stockholders Equity. See the "Contractual obligations" section of this Item 2 for further detail on the calculation of our management fee and for the definition of Stockholders Equity. In connection with the WMC acquisition, we and our Manager entered into the MITT Management Agreement Amendment pursuant to which the base management fee will be reduced by 0.6 million for the first four quarters following the transaction closing, beginning with the fiscal quarter in which the transaction closing occurs (i.e., resulting in an aggregate 2.4 million waiver of base management fees). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the base management fee was reduced by 0.6 million. This was offset by an increase in stockholders' equity as calculated pursuant to the management agreement as a result of the WMC acquisition. 
 
 Non-investment related expenses 
 
 Non-investment related expenses are primarily comprised of professional fees, directors and officers ("D O") insurance, directors compensation, and certain non-investment related expenses reimbursable to our Manager or its affiliates.

 Earnings Available for Distribution 
 
 One of our objectives is to generate net income from net interest margin on the portfolio, and management uses EAD, as one of several metrics, to help measure our performance against this objective. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure, when considered with our GAAP financial statements, provides supplemental information useful for investors to help evaluate our financial performance. However, management also believes that our definition of EAD has important limitations as it does not include certain earnings or losses our management team considers in evaluating our financial performance. Our presentation of EAD may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, who may use different calculations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders or Net income/(loss) per diluted common share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. 
 
 We define EAD, a non-GAAP financial measure, as Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders excluding (i) (a) unrealized gains/(losses) on loans, real estate securities, derivatives and other investments, inclusive of our investment in AG Arc, and (b) net realized gains/(losses) on the sale or termination of such instruments, (ii) any transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition, disposition, or securitization of our investments as well as transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the WMC acquisition, (iii) accrued deal-related performance fees payable to third party operators to the extent the primary component of the accrual relates to items that are excluded from EAD, such as unrealized and realized gains/(losses), (iv) realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Arc Home's net mortgage servicing rights and the derivatives intended to offset changes in the fair value of those net mortgage servicing rights, (v) deferred taxes recognized at our taxable REIT subsidiaries, if any, (vi) any bargain purchase gains recognized, and (vii) certain other nonrecurring gains or losses. Items (i) through (vii) above include any amount related to those items held in affiliated entities. Transaction related expenses referenced in (ii) above are primarily comprised of costs incurred prior to or at the time of executing our securitizations and acquiring or disposing of residential mortgage loans. These costs are nonrecurring and may include underwriting fees, legal fees, diligence fees, and other similar transaction related expenses. Recurring expenses, such as servicing fees, custodial fees, trustee fees and other similar ongoing fees are not excluded from earnings available for distribution. Management considers the transaction related expenses to be similar to realized losses incurred at the acquisition, disposition, or securitization of an asset and does not view them as being part of its core operations. Management views the exclusion described in (iv) above to be consistent with how it calculates EAD on the remainder of its portfolio. Management excludes all deferred taxes because it believes deferred taxes are not representative of current operations. EAD includes the net interest income and other income earned on our investments on a yield adjusted basis, including TBA dollar roll income/(loss) or any other investment activity that may earn or pay net interest or its economic equivalent.

 Investment activities 
 
 Investment activities 
 
 We aim to allocate capital to investment opportunities with attractive risk/return profiles in our target asset classes. Our investment activities primarily include acquiring and securitizing newly-originated residential mortgage loans. We finance our acquired loans through various financing lines on a short-term basis and securitize the loans to obtain long-term, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market financing as market conditions permit. We may also invest in Agency RMBS to utilize excess liquidity. Our investment and capital allocation decisions depend on prevailing market conditions and compliance with Investment Company Act and REIT tests, among other factors, and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different economic and capital market environments. As a result, in reacting to market conditions and taking into account a variety of other factors, including liquidity, duration, and interest rate expectations, the mix of our assets changes over time as we deploy capital. We actively evaluate our investments based on factors including, among others, the characteristics of the underlying collateral, geography, expected return, expected future prepayment trends, supply of and demand for our investments, costs of financing, costs of hedging, expected future interest rate volatility, and the overall shape of the U.S. Treasury and interest rate swap yield curves. 
 
 In December 2023, through our acquisition of WMC, we increased our investment portfolio by 1.2 billion, which primarily consisted of Securitized Non-Agency Loans. For more information on the WMC acquisition, refer to "WMC Acquisition" above and the section entitled "WMC Acquisition" in Note 1 to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)."

Net interest margin and leverage ratio 
 
 Net interest margin and leverage ratio are metrics that management believes should be considered when evaluating the performance of our investment portfolio. Net interest margin provides investors visibility into our profitability of interest income versus interest expense including the net effect of our interest rate swaps for insight into earnings available for distribution. 
 
 GAAP net interest margin and non-GAAP net interest margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, are calculated by subtracting the weighted average cost of funds from the weighted average yield for our GAAP investment portfolio and our investment portfolio, respectively. The weighted average yield represents an effective interest rate on our cost basis, which utilizes all estimates of future cash flows and adjusts for actual prepayment and cash flow activity as of quarter-end. The calculation of weighted average yield is weighted on cost at quarter-end. The weighted average cost of funds is the sum of the weighted average funding costs on total financing arrangements outstanding at quarter-end, including all non-recourse financing arrangements, and our weighted average hedging cost or benefit, which is the weighted average of the net pay or receive rates on our interest rate swaps. GAAP and non-GAAP cost of funds are weighted by the outstanding financing arrangements on our GAAP investment portfolio and our investment portfolio, respectively, and the cost of securitized debt at quarter-end. 
 
 Our leverage ratio is determined by our portfolio mix as well as many additional factors, including the liquidity of our portfolio, the availability and price of our financing, the available capacity to finance our assets, and anticipated regulatory developments. See the "Financing activities" section below for more detail on our leverage ratio.

Securitized Non-Agency Loans 
 
 As noted above, our investment activities primarily include acquiring and securitizing newly-originated residential mortgage loans. These securitization trusts ("Non-Agency VIEs") are collateralized by Non-Agency and Agency-Eligible Loans. 
 
 In each securitization transaction, we transfer a pool of loans to a wholly-owned subsidiary and the loans are deposited into a newly created securitization trust. The securitization trust issues various classes of mortgage pass-through certificates backed by the cash flows from the underlying residential mortgage loans (the "Certificates"). When we sponsor a residential mortgage loan securitization, we are generally required to retain at least 5 of the fair value of the Certificates issued in the securitization ("Risk Retention Rules"). We can retain either an "eligible vertical interest" (which consists of at least 5 of each class of securities issued in the securitization), an "eligible horizontal residual interest" (which is the most subordinate class of securities with a fair value of at least 5 of the aggregate credit risk) or a combination of both totaling 5 (the "Required Credit Risk") . In order to comply with the Risk Retention Rules in each securitization transaction, we generally purchase the most subordinated classes of Certificates and the excess cash flow Certificates. We also purchase the Certificates entitled to excess servicing fees and may purchase other Certificates issued by the securitization trust, while typically selling the senior classes of Certificates to unrelated third parties. 
 
 If we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization transactions, we consolidate the respective VIE created to facilitate the transaction and record "Securitized residential mortgage loans" and "Securitized debt" on the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, as noted above, our equity at risk represents certain Certificates from each securitization which we retain.

 (1) Interest Only securities have no principal balances and bear interest based on a notional value. The notional value is used solely to determine interest distributions on the interest only classes of securities. As of September 30, 2024, the Securitized debt in Non-Agency VIEs line item includes interest only classes with a notional value of 1.3 billion. As of September 30, 2024, the notional value of Interest Only / Excess Servicing Bonds was 11.6 billion. 
 (2) Represents the fair value of real estate owned within Non-Agency VIEs. We record real estate owned at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. As of September 30, 2024, we recorded real estate owned within our Non-Agency VIEs at 0.7 million. 
 (3) Maximum loss exposure from our involvement with VIEs pertains to the fair value of the Certificates retained from the VIEs. We have no obligation to provide any other explicit or implicit support to the securitization trusts. 
 (4) As of September 30, 2024, our equity at risk included bonds with a fair value of 438.6 million held in order to comply with Risk Retention Rules. We are generally required to hold the Required Credit Risk until the later of (i) the fifth anniversary of the securitization closing date and (ii) the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loans has been reduced to 25 of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loans as of the securitization closing date, but no longer than the seventh anniversary of the closing date. 
 (5) As of September 30, 2024, a portion of our equity at risk included bonds exposed to the first loss of the securitization with a fair value of 112.6 million. 
 (6) Excludes net other asset/(liabilities) held within the VIEs of 7.8 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 (7) As the sponsor and depositor of each securitization, we may purchase all of the outstanding Certificates (an "Optional Redemption") following the earlier of (1) an applicable anniversary date (typically two or three years) of the respective securitization or (2) the date at which the unpaid principal balance of the applicable collateral has declined below a certain percentage (typically 10 to 30 of the principal balance originally contributed to the securitization. As of September 30, 2024, there were four securitizations with an unpaid principal balance of 0.6 billion that met the criteria for an Optional Redemption.

Financing activities 
 
 In December 2023, through our acquisition of WMC, we assumed liabilities of 1.1 billion, which primarily consisted of securitized debt, financing arrangements, and convertible senior unsecured notes. For more information on the acquisition of WMC, refer to "WMC Acquisition" above and the section entitled "WMC Acquisition" in Note 1 to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)." 
 
 Financing Arrangements 
 
 We use leverage to finance the purchase of our investment portfolio. Our leverage has primarily been in the form of repurchase agreements and similar financing arrangements (which we refer to collectively as financing arrangements), and securitized debt. 
 
 Repurchase agreements involve the sale and a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the transferred assets or similar assets at a future date. The amount borrowed generally is equal to the fair value of the assets pledged less an agreed-upon discount, referred to as a "haircut." The size of the haircut reflects the perceived risk associated with the pledged asset. Haircuts may change as our financing arrangements mature or roll and are sensitive to governmental regulations. Interest rates for our financing arrangements are determined based on prevailing rates (typically a spread over a base rate) corresponding to the terms of the borrowings, and interest is paid on a monthly basis or, for shorter term arrangements, at the end of the term. Repurchase agreements typically have a term of up to one year for loans and a term of 30 to 90 days for securities. Repurchase agreements are generally mark-to-market with respect to margin calls and recourse to us. We had outstanding financing arrangements with six and seven counterparties as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Our financing arrangements generally include customary representations, warranties, and covenants, but may also contain more restrictive supplemental terms and conditions. Although specific to each financing arrangement, typical supplemental terms include requirements of minimum equity and liquidity, leverage ratios, and performance triggers. In addition, some of the financing arrangements contain cross default features, whereby default under an agreement with one lender simultaneously causes default under agreements with other lenders. To the extent that we fail to comply with the covenants contained in these financing arrangements or are otherwise found to be in default under the terms of such agreements, the counterparty has the right to accelerate amounts due under the associated agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants. 
 
 We also use securitized debt to finance our loan portfolio. Securitized debt is generally non-mark-to-market with respect to margin calls and non-recourse to us. 
 
 Legacy WMC Convertible Notes 
 
 Through our acquisition of WMC, we assumed the Legacy WMC Convertible Notes.

 Leverage 
 
 We use leverage to increase potential returns to our stockholders and to fund the acquisition of our investment portfolio. Our financing strategy is designed to increase the size of our investment portfolio by borrowing against the fair value of the assets in our portfolio. When acquiring residential mortgage loans and other assets, we finance our investments using repurchase agreements or similar financing arrangements, which we refer to collectively as "financing arrangements." Upon accumulating a targeted amount of residential mortgage loans, we finance these assets utilizing long-term, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market securitizations as market conditions permit. Financing arrangements are generally recourse to the Company whereas securitized debt used to finance our Non-Agency VIEs and RPL/NPL VIEs is generally non-recourse to the Company. In addition to disclosing GAAP leverage, we also disclose Economic Leverage, which excludes non-recourse financing. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure, when considered with our GAAP financial statements, provides supplemental information useful for investors to help evaluate our use of leverage and the related risk associated with our leverage profile. Our presentation of Economic Leverage may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, who may use different calculations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP leverage calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. 
 
 We define GAAP leverage as the sum of (1) GAAP Securitized debt, at fair value, (2) GAAP Financing arrangements, net of any restricted cash posted on such financing arrangements, (3) Senior Unsecured Notes, and (4) the amount payable on purchases that have not yet settled less the financing remaining on sales that have not yet settled. We define Economic Leverage, a non-GAAP metric, as the sum of: (i) our GAAP leverage, exclusive of any fully non-recourse financing arrangements, (ii) financing arrangements held through affiliated entities, net of any restricted cash posted on such financing arrangements, exclusive of any financing utilized through AG Arc, inclusive of any adjustment related to unsettled trades as described in (4) in the previous sentence, and exclusive of any non-recourse financing arrangements and (iii) our net TBA position (at cost), if any.

The calculations in the tables below divide GAAP leverage and Economic Leverage by our GAAP stockholders equity to derive our leverage ratios. The following tables present a reconciliation of our Economic Leverage ratio to GAAP Leverage in thousands).

 (1) Non-recourse financing arrangements include securitized debt and other non-recourse financing arrangements. 
 
 Hedging activities 
 
 Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our Investment Company Act exemption, to the extent leverage is deployed, we may utilize derivative instruments in an effort to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the financing of our portfolio. Specifically, we may seek to hedge our exposure to potential interest rate mismatches between the interest we earn on our investments and our borrowing costs caused by fluctuations in short-term interest rates. We may utilize interest rate swaps, swaption agreements, and other financial instruments such as short positions in to-be-announced securities. In utilizing leverage and interest rate derivatives, our objectives are to improve risk-adjusted returns and, where possible, to lock in, on a long-term basis, a spread between the yield on our assets and the costs of our financing and hedging. Derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments for GAAP. See Note 7 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)" for more information. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 Federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT ordinary taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its net taxable income. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our financing arrangements and other debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make required cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. 
 
 As described above, our distribution requirements are based on taxable income rather than GAAP net income. Differences between taxable income and GAAP net income include (i) unrealized gains and losses associated with investment and derivative portfolios which are marked-to-market in current income for GAAP purposes, but excluded from taxable income until realized or settled, (ii) temporary differences related to amortization of premiums and discounts paid on investments, (iii) the timing and amount of deductions related to stock-based compensation, (iv) temporary differences related to the recognition of realized gains and losses on sold investments and certain terminated derivatives, (v) taxes, and (vi) differences between GAAP income or losses in our TRSs and taxable income resulting from dividend distributions to the REIT from our TRSs. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company declared common stock dividends of 0.56. During the same period, the Company declared and paid preferred stock dividends on its Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock of 1.54689, 1.50, and 1.50, respectively. 
 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 
 Our liquidity determines our ability to meet our cash obligations, including distributions to our stockholders, payment of our expenses, financing our investments and satisfying other general business needs. 
 
 Our principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under financing arrangements, principal and interest payments we receive on our investment portfolio, cash generated from our operating results, and proceeds from capital market transactions. We typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our financing arrangements, to purchase loans, real estate securities, and other real 
 75 

estate related assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, to repurchase our capital stock, and to fund our operations. We may also generate liquidity when restricted cash that was pledged as collateral for clearing and executing trades, derivatives, and financing arrangements becomes unrestricted when the related collateral requirements are exceeded or at the maturity of the derivative or financing arrangement. Refer to " Margin requirements" below discussing instances where we may use liquidity to meet margin requirements. At September 30, 2024, we had 119.7 million of liquidity, which consisted of 102.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and 17.2 million of unencumbered Agency RMBS available to support our liquidity needs. Refer to the "Contractual obligations" section of this Item 2 for additional obligations that could impact our liquidity. 
 
 Margin requirements 
 
 The fair value of our loans and real estate securities fluctuate according to market conditions. When the fair value of the assets pledged as collateral to secure a financing arrangement decreases to the point where the difference between the collateral fair value and the financing arrangement amount is less than the haircut, our lenders may issue a "margin call," which requires us to post additional collateral to the lender in the form of additional assets or cash. Under our repurchase facilities, our lenders have full discretion to determine the fair value of the securities we pledge to them. Our lenders typically value assets based on recent transactions in the market. Lenders also issue margin calls as the published current principal balance factors change on the pool of mortgages underlying the securities pledged as collateral when scheduled and unscheduled paydowns are announced monthly. We experience margin calls in the ordinary course of our business. In seeking to effectively manage the margin requirements established by our lenders, we maintain a position of cash and, when owned, unpledged Agency RMBS. We refer to this position as our "liquidity." The level of liquidity we maintain to meet margin calls is directly affected by our leverage levels, our haircuts and the price changes on our assets. Typically, if interest rates increase or if credit spreads widen, then the prices of our collateral (and our unpledged Agency RMBS that constitute a portion of our liquidity) will decline, we will experience margin calls, and we will need to use our liquidity to meet the margin calls. There can be no assurance that we will maintain sufficient levels of liquidity to meet any margin calls. If our haircuts on existing financing arrangements increase, our liquidity will proportionately decrease. We intend to maintain a level of liquidity in relation to our borrowings that enables us to meet reasonably anticipated margin calls but that also allows us to be substantially invested in the residential mortgage market. We may misjudge the appropriate amount of our liquidity by maintaining excessive liquidity, which would lower our investment returns, or by maintaining insufficient liquidity, which may force us to liquidate assets into potentially unfavorable market conditions and harm our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Similar to the margin calls that we receive on our borrowing agreements, we may also receive margin calls on our derivative instruments when their fair value declines. This typically occurs when prevailing market rates change adversely, with the severity of the change also dependent on the terms of the derivatives involved. We may also receive margin calls on our derivatives based on the implied volatility of interest rates. Our posting of collateral with our counterparties can be done in cash or assets, and is generally bilateral, which means that if the fair value of our interest rate hedges increases, our counterparty will be required to post collateral with us. Refer to the "Liquidity risk derivatives" section of Item 3 below for a further discussion on margin.

 (1) Cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to net interest income less operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 (2) Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to purchases of investments, offset by principal repayments on investments and sales of investments. 
 (3) Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of securitized debt and our Senior Unsecured Notes and net borrowings under financing agreements, offset by principal repayments on securitized debt, repurchases of the Legacy WMC Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes and the subsequent payoff of the Legacy WMC Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes at maturity, and dividend payments. 
 
 Stock repurchase programs 
 
 On August 3, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the "2022 Repurchase Program") to repurchase up to 15.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The 2022 Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and permits us to repurchase our shares through various methods, including open market repurchases, privately negotiated block transactions and Rule 10b5-1 plans. We may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in compliance with SEC regulations and other legal requirements. The extent to which we repurchase our shares, and the timing, manner, price, and amount of any such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors including market conditions and other corporate considerations as determined by management, as well as the limits of the 2022 Repurchase Program and our liquidity and business strategy. The 2022 Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of shares and may be modified or discontinued at any time. As of the date of this filing, approximately 1.5 million of common stock remained authorized for future share repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program. See Note 11 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)" for additional details on the shares repurchased under the 2022 Repurchase Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 On May 4, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the "2023 Repurchase Program") to repurchase up to 15.0 million of our outstanding common stock on substantially the same terms as the 2022 Repurchase Program. As of the date of this filing, the full 15.0 million authorized amount remains available for repurchase under the 2023 Repurchase Program. This authorization is in addition to the amount remaining under the 2022 Repurchase Program. 
 
 On February 22, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the "Preferred Repurchase Program") pursuant to which our Board of Directors granted a repurchase authorization to acquire shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock having an aggregate value of up to 20.0 million. No share repurchases under the Preferred Repurchase Program have been made since its authorization. 
 
 Shares of stock repurchased by us under any repurchase program, if any, will be cancelled and, until reissued by us, will be deemed to be authorized but unissued shares of its stock as required by Maryland law. The cost of the acquisition by us of shares of our own stock in excess of the aggregate par value of the shares first reduces additional paid-in capital, to the extent available, with any residual cost applied against retained earnings. 
 
 Equity distribution agreements 
 
 On May 5, 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with each of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and JMP Securities LLC (collectively, the "Sales Agents"), which we refer to as the "Equity Distribution Agreements," pursuant to which 
 77 

we may sell up to 100.0 million aggregate offering price of shares of our common stock from time to time through the Sales Agents, under the Securities Act of 1933. We did not issue any shares of common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Since inception of the program, we have issued approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreements for gross proceeds of 48.3 million. 
 
 Effective November 6, 2024, the Company terminated the Equity Distribution Agreements and entered into new equity distribution agreements (the "2024 Equity Distribution Agreements") with each of BTIG, LLC, JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, Keefe, Bruyette Woods, Inc. and Piper Sandler Co. (collectively, the "2024 Sales Agents"). Pursuant to the 2024 Equity Distribution Agreements, the Company may sell up to 75.0 million aggregate offering price of shares of its common stock from time to time through an "at the market" equity offering program under which the 2024 Sales Agents will act as sales agent and/or principal. 
 
 Forward-looking statements regarding liquidity 
 
 Based upon our current portfolio, leverage and available borrowing arrangements, we believe the net proceeds of our common equity offerings, preferred equity offerings, senior unsecured note issuances, and private placements, combined with cash flow from operating activities, financing activities, and our available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements, including funding our investment activities, paying fees under our management agreement, funding our distributions to stockholders, funding financing maturities, and paying general corporate expenses. 
 
 Contractual obligations 
 
 Management agreement 
 
 The management agreement, as amended, provides for payment to the Manager of a management fee, an incentive fee, and reimbursements of certain expenses incurred by the Manager or its affiliates on behalf of us. Pursuant to our management agreement, the closing of the TPG Transaction resulted in an assignment of the management agreement. Our independent directors unanimously consented to such assignment on July 31, 2023 in advance of the TPG Transaction closing. There were no changes to the management agreement in connection with the TPG Transaction and the assignment of the management agreement became effective upon the closing of the TPG Transaction. 
 
 In connection with the Merger with WMC, which was completed on December 6, 2023, and contemporaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on August 8, 2023, we and our Manager entered into the MITT Management Agreement Amendment, pursuant to which (i) our Manager s base management fee will be reduced by 0.6 million for the first four quarters following the Effective Time, beginning with the fiscal quarter in which the Effective Time occurs (i.e., resulting in an aggregate 2.4 million waiver of base management fees), and (ii) our Manager will waive its right to seek reimbursement from us for any expenses otherwise reimbursable by us under the management agreement in an amount equal to approximately 1.3 million, which is the excess of 7.0 million over the aggregate Per Share Additional Merger Consideration paid by our Manager to the holders of WMC Common Stock under the Merger Agreement. The MITT Management Agreement Amendment became effective automatically upon the closing of the Merger. 
 78 

Management fee 
 
 The management fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to 1.50 of our Stockholders Equity, per annum. For purposes of calculating the management fee, "Stockholders Equity" means the sum of the net proceeds from any issuances of equity securities (including preferred securities) since inception (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance, and excluding any future equity issuance to the Manager), plus our retained earnings at the end of such quarter (without taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense or other non-cash items described below incurred in current or prior periods), less any amount that we pay for repurchases of our common stock, excluding any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items that have impacted stockholders equity as reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, and excluding one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP, and certain other non-cash charges after discussions between the Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors. Stockholders Equity, for purposes of calculating the management fee, could be greater or less than the amount of stockholders equity shown on our financial statements. The below table details the management fees incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands).

 (1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Manager agreed to waive its right to receive management fees of 0.6 million and 1.8 million, respectively, pursuant to the MITT Management Agreement Amendment executed in connection with the Merger. As of September 30, 2024, all of the 2.4 million management fee waiver agreed upon in connection with the Merger has been utilized. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have recorded management fees payable of 1.7 million and 1.5 million, respectively. The management fee payable is included within the "Due to affiliates" line item within the "Other liabilities" line item on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Incentive fee 
 
 The Manager is entitled to an annual incentive fee with respect to each applicable fiscal year, which will be equal to 15 of the amount by which our cumulative adjusted net income from November 22, 2021 exceeds the cumulative hurdle amount, which represents an 8 return (cumulative, but not compounding) on an equity hurdle base consisting of the sum of (i) 341.5 million and (ii) the gross proceeds of any subsequent public or private common stock offerings by us. The annual incentive fee will be payable in cash, or, at the option of our Board of Directors, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not incur any incentive fee expense. 
 
 Termination fee 
 
 Upon the occurrence of (i) our termination of the management agreement without cause or (ii) the Manager s termination of the management agreement upon a breach by the Company of any material term of the management agreement, the Manager will be entitled to a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee during the 24-month period prior to such termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no event of termination of the management agreement had occurred. 
 
 Expense reimbursement 
 
 Our Manager uses the proceeds from its management fee in part to pay compensation to its officers and personnel, who, notwithstanding that certain of them also are our officers, receive no compensation directly from us. We are required to reimburse our Manager or its affiliates for operating expenses incurred by our Manager or its affiliates on our behalf, including certain salary expenses and other expenses relating to legal, accounting, due diligence and other services. Our reimbursement obligation is not subject to any dollar limitation; however, reimbursements are subject to an annual budget process which combines guidelines from the management agreement with oversight by our Board of Directors and discussions with our Manager.

 Share-based compensation 
 
 The AG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, which became effective on April 15, 2020 following the approval of our stockholders at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, provides for a maximum of 666,666 shares of common stock that may be issued under the plan. The maximum number of shares of common stock granted during a single fiscal year to any non-employee director, taken together with any cash fees paid to such non-employee director during any fiscal year, shall not exceed 300,000 in total value (calculating the value of any such awards based on the grant date fair value). As of September 30, 2024, 406,539 shares of common stock remained available to be awarded under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan. 
 
 Since inception of the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan and through September 30, 2024, we have granted an aggregate of 232,467 shares of restricted common stock to our independent directors under our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, all of which have vested. 
 
 On December 6, 2023, in connection with the WMC acquisition, we granted an aggregate 25,962 restricted stock units to the two independent directors added to our Board of Directors who previously served on WMC's board of directors. Through September 30, 2024, the two independent directors have also been granted an aggregate of 1,698 dividend equivalent units. These restricted stock units and associated dividend equivalent units vested in full on June 23, 2024, and will be settled in shares of our common stock upon each independent director's separation from service with our Board of Directors. 
 
 The AG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc. 2021 Manager Equity Incentive Plan (the "2021 Manager Plan"), which became effective on April 7, 2021 following the approval of our stockholders at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, provides for a maximum of 573,425 shares of common stock that may be subject to awards thereunder to our Manager. As of September 30, 2024, there were no shares or awards issued under the 2021 Manager Plan. Following the execution of the Third Amendment to our management agreement in November 2021 related to the incentive fee, our compensation committee no longer expects to continue its historical practice of making periodic equity grants to the Manager pursuant to the 2021 Manager Plan. 
 
 Unfunded commitments 
 
 See Note 12 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)" for detail on our commitments as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements 
 
 Our investments in debt and equity of affiliates primarily consist of real estate securities and our interest in AG Arc. Investments in debt and equity of affiliates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Certain of our investments in debt and equity of affiliates securitize residential mortgage loans and retain interests in the subordinated tranches of the transferred assets. These retained interests are included in the MATT Non-QM Securities and Re/Non-Performing Securities line items of our investment portfolio. See Note 10 to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)" for a discussion of investments i n debt and equity of affiliates.

We record TBA purchases and sales on the trade date and present the purchase or receipt net of the corresponding payable or receivable until the settlement date of the transaction. Refer to Note 7 to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)" for additional detail on TBAs as of September 30, 2024, if applicable. 
 
 For additional information on our commitments as of September 30, 2024 , refer to Note 12 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)." We do not expect these commitments, taken as a whole, to be significant to, or to have a material impact on, our overall liquidity or capital resources or our operations. 
 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
 
 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based, in part, on our judgment and assumptions regarding various economic conditions that we believe are reasonable based on facts and circumstances existing at the time of reporting. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions utilized in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Although our estimates contemplate conditions as of September 30, 2024 and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than anticipated in arriving at those estimates, which could materially affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. 
 
 Our most critical accounting policies include (i) Valuation of financial instruments, (ii) Accounting for loans, (iii) Accounting for real estate securities, (iv) Interest income recognition, (v) Financing arrangements, (vi) Investment consolidation, and (vii) Accounting for business combinations. Our critical accounting estimates are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain and include (i), (iv), and (vi) above. A discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our Form 10-K. Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not materially changed since December 31, 2023. 
 
 REIT Qualification 
 
 We have elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 859 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and that our manner of operation enables us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. 
 
 We generally need to distribute at least 90 of our ordinary taxable income each year (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders in order to qualify as a REIT under the Code. Our ability to make distributions to our stockholders depends, in part, upon the performance of our investment portfolio. 
 
 As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our REIT qualification. Accordingly, our failure to qualify as a REIT could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and our ability to pay distributions, if any, to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property. In addition, any income earned by a domestic taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, will be subject to corporate income taxation. 
 
 Investment Company Act Exemption 
 
 We conduct our operations so that we are not considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act, a company is deemed to be an investment company if it is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire "investment securities" having a value exceeding 40 of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis (the "40 test"). "Investment securities" do not include, among other things, U.S. government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that (i) are not investment 
 81 

companies and (ii) are not relying on the exceptions from the definition of investment company provided by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. 
 
 Conducting our operations so as not to be considered an investment company under the Investment Company Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the Investment Company Act and SEC staff interpretive guidance limits our ability to make certain investments. For example, these restrictions limit our and our subsidiaries ability to invest directly in Agency RMBS mortgage-related securities that represent less than the entire ownership in a pool of mortgage loans or debt and equity tranches of Non-Agency RMBS (in each case to the extent such interest are not retained interest in securitizations consisting of mortgage loans that were owned by us and such securitizations were not sponsored by us in order to obtain financing to acquire additional mortgage loans), certain real estate companies and assets not related to real estate.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The primary components of our market risk relate to interest rates, liquidity, real estate, credit, prepayment rates, basis, and capital markets risk. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we seek to assume risk that can be reasonably quantified from historical experience and to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient returns to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake. Many of these risks have become particularly heightened due to sustained inflation, rising mortgage rates, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy actions, and market uncertainty from geopolitical risks. 
 
 Interest rate risk 
 
 Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary, fiscal and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with both our investments and the financing under our financing arrangements. We generally seek to manage this risk by monitoring the reset index and the interest rate related to our investment portfolio and our financings; by structuring our financing arrangements to have a range of maturity terms, amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods; and by using derivative instruments to adjust interest rate sensitivity of our investment portfolio and borrowings. Our hedging techniques can be highly complex, and the value of our investment portfolio and derivatives may be adversely affected as a result of changing interest rates. 
 
 Interest rate effects on net interest income 
 
 Our operating results depend in large part upon differences between the yields earned on our investments and our cost of borrowing and upon the effectiveness of our interest rate hedging activities. The majority of our financing arrangements are short term in nature, exclusive of our residential mortgage loans financed through securitized debt. Repurchase agreements financing our securities portfolio or retained interests from our securitizations typically have an initial term between 30 and 90 days while repurchase agreements financing our residential mortgage loans prior to securitization have an initial term of one year. The financing rate on these agreements will generally be determined at the outset of each transaction by reference to prevailing rates plus a spread. As a result, our borrowing costs will tend to increase during periods of rising interest rates as we renew, or "roll", maturing transactions at the higher prevailing rates. When combined with the fact that the income we earn on our fixed interest rate investments will remain substantially unchanged, this will result in a narrowing of the net interest spread between the related assets and borrowings and may even result in losses. 
 
 In an attempt to offset the increase in funding costs related to rising interest rates, our Manager may cause us to enter into hedging transactions structured to provide us with positive cash flow in the event interest rates rise. Our Manager accomplishes this through the use of interest rate derivatives. Some hedging strategies involving the use of derivatives are highly complex, may produce volatile returns and may expose us to increased risks relating to counterparty defaults. 
 
 Interest rate effects on fair value 
 
 Another component of interest rate risk is the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the fair value of the assets that we acquire. 
 
 Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, the fair value of our loan and real estate securities portfolios would be expected to decrease, all other factors being held constant. In particular, the portion of our real estate securities and loan portfolios with fixed-rate coupons would be expected to decrease in value more severely than that portion with a floating-rate coupon. This is because fixed-rate coupon assets tend to have significantly more duration, or price sensitivity to changes in interest rates, than floating-rate coupon assets. Fixed-rate assets currently represent a majority of our portfolio. 
 
 The fair value of our investment portfolio could change at a different rate than the fair value of our liabilities when interest rates change. We measure the sensitivity of our portfolio to changes in interest rates by estimating the duration of our assets and liabilities. Duration is the approximate percentage change in fair value for an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve while assuming all other market risk factors remain constant. In general, our assets have higher duration than our liabilities. In order to reduce this exposure, we use hedging instruments to reduce the gap in duration between our assets and liabilities. 
 
 We calculate estimated effective duration (i.e., the price sensitivity to changes in risk-free interest rates) to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on our portfolio value. We estimate duration based on third-party models. Different models and methodologies can produce different effective duration estimates for the same assets. We allocate the net duration by asset type based on the interest rate sensitivity. 
 83 

The following chart details information about our duration gap as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Duration (1)(2) Years Agency RMBS (0.17) Securitized Residential Mortgage Loans 2.76 Real Estate Securities and Legacy WMC Commercial Loans 0.38 Hedges on securitized products (0.64) Securitized products subtotal 2.50 Residential Mortgage Loans (3) 0.47 Hedges on Residential Mortgage Loans (0.11) Residential Mortgage Loans subtotal 0.36 Senior Unsecured Notes (0.25) Total 2.44 
 (1) Duration related to financing arrangements is netted within its respective line items. 
 (2) Duration does not include our investment in AG Arc LLC. 
 (3) Residential Mortgage Loans are inclusive of forward purchase commitments to acquire Non-Agency Loans and Agency-Eligible Loans as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The following table quantifies the estimated percent change in GAAP equity, the fair value of our assets, and projected net interest income should interest rates go up or down instantaneously by 25, 50, and 75 basis points, assuming (i) the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve and (ii) all other market risk factors remain constant. These estimates were compiled using a combination of third-party services and models, market data and internal models. All changes in equity, assets, and income are measured as percentage changes from the GAAP equity, assets, and projected net interest income from our base interest rate scenario. The base interest rate scenario assumes spot and forward interest rates existing as of September 30, 2024. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 
 
 Agency RMBS and Agency-Eligible Loan assumptions attempt to predict default and prepayment activity at projected interest rate levels. To the extent that these estimates or other assumptions do not hold true, actual results will likely differ materially from projections and could result in percentage changes larger or smaller than the estimates in the table below. Moreover, if different models were employed in the analysis, materially different projections could result. In addition, while the table below reflects the estimated impact of interest rate increases and decreases on a static portfolio as of September 30, 2024, our Manager may from time to time sell any of our investments as a part of the overall management of our investment portfolio. 
 
 Change in Interest Rates (basis points) (1) Change in Fair Value as a Percentage of GAAP Equity (2)(3) Change in Fair Value as a Percentage of Assets (2)(3) Percentage Change in Projected Net Interest Income (4) 75 (4.8) (0.4) (1.3) 50 (3.1) (0.2) (0.7) 25 (1.6) (0.1) (0.2) (25) 1.6 0.1 0.2 (50) 3.1 0.2 0.5 (75) 4.7 0.4 0.7 
 (1) Includes investments held through affiliated entities that are reported as "Investments in debt and equity of affiliates" on our consolidated balance sheet, but excludes AG Arc. 
 (2) Does not include cash investments, which typically have overnight maturities and are not expected to change in value as interest rates change. 
 (3) Changes in fair value as a percentage of GAAP equity and assets are inclusive of forward purchase commitments to acquire Non-Agency Loans and Agency-Eligible Loans as of September 30, 2024. 
 (4) Interest income includes trades settled as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The information set forth in the interest rate sensitivity table above and all related disclosures constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Actual results could 
 84 

differ significantly from those estimated in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table. See below for additional risks which may impact the fair value of our assets, GAAP equity and net income. 
 
 Liquidity risk 
 
 Our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long-maturity assets with shorter-term financings primarily in the form of financing arrangements. Our Manager seeks to mitigate our liquidity risks by maintaining a prudent level of leverage, monitoring our liquidity position on a daily basis and maintaining a reasonable cushion of cash and unpledged real estate securities and loans in our portfolio in order to meet future margin calls. In addition, our Manager seeks to further mitigate our liquidity risk by (i) maintaining relationships with a carefully selected group of financing counterparties and (ii) monitoring the ongoing financial stability and future business plans of our financing counterparties. 
 
 Liquidity risk financing arrangements 
 
 We pledge mortgage loans or real estate securities and cash as collateral to secure our financing arrangements. Should the fair value of our mortgage loans or real estate securities pledged as collateral decrease (as a result of rising interest rates, changes in prepayment speeds, widening of credit spreads or otherwise), we will likely be subject to margin calls for additional collateral from our financing counterparties. Should the fair value of our mortgage loans or real estate securities decrease materially and suddenly, margin calls will likely increase causing an adverse change to our liquidity position which could result in substantial losses. In addition, we cannot be assured that we will always be able to roll our financing arrangements at their scheduled maturities, which could cause material additional harm to our liquidity position and result in substantial losses. Further, should funding conditions tighten as they did in 2007-2008, 2009 and more recently in March 2020, our financing arrangement counterparties may increase our margin requirements on new financings, including repurchase transactions that we roll at maturity with the same counterparty. This would require us to post additional collateral and would reduce our ability to use leverage and could potentially cause us to incur substantial losses. 
 
 Liquidity risk derivatives 
 
 The terms of our interest rate swaps require us to post collateral in the form of cash or Agency RMBS to our counterparties to satisfy two types of margin requirements: variation margin and initial margin. 
 
 We and our swap counterparties are both required to post variation margin to each other depending upon the daily moves in prevailing benchmark interest rates. The amount of this variation margin is derived from the mark to market valuation of our swaps. Hence, as our swaps lose value in a falling interest rate environment, we are required to post additional variation margin to our counterparties on a daily basis; conversely, as our swaps gain value in a rising interest rate environment, we are able to recall variation margin from our counterparties. By recalling variation margin from our swaps counterparties, we are able to partially mitigate the liquidity risk created by margin calls on our repurchase transactions during periods of rising interest rates. 
 
 Initial margin works differently. Collateral posted to meet initial margin requirements is intended to create a safety buffer to benefit our counterparties if we were to default on our payment obligations under the terms of the swaps and our counterparties were forced to unwind the swap. Initial margin on our centrally cleared trades varies from day to day depending upon various factors, including the absolute level of interest rates and the implied volatility of interest rates. There is a distinctly positive correlation between initial margin, on the one hand, and the absolute level of interest rates and implied volatility of interest rates, on the other hand. As a result, in times of rising interest rates or increasing rate volatility, we anticipate that the initial margin required on our centrally-cleared trades will likewise increase, potentially by a substantial amount. These margin increases will have a negative impact on our liquidity position and will likely impair the intended liquidity risk mitigation effect of our swaps discussed above. 
 
 Real estate value risk 
 
 Residential property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors), local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of housing), natural disasters, the effects of climate change (including flooding, drought, and severe weather) and other natural events, construction quality, age and design, demographic factors, and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. Decreases in property values could cause us to suffer losses and reduce the value of the collateral underlying our investment portfolio as well as the potential sale proceeds available to repay our loans in the event of a default. In addition, substantial decreases in property values can increase the rate of strategic defaults by residential mortgage borrowers which can impact and create significant uncertainty in the recovery of principal and 
 85 

interest on our investments. 
 
 Credit risk 
 
 We are exposed to the risk of potential credit losses from an unanticipated increase in borrower defaults as well as general credit spread widening on any non-agency assets in our portfolio. We seek to manage this risk through our Manager s pre-acquisition due diligence process and, if available, through the use of non-recourse financing, which limits our exposure to credit losses to the specific pool of collateral which is the subject of the non-recourse financing. Our Manager s pre-acquisition due diligence process includes the evaluation of, among other things, relative valuation, supply and demand trends, the shape of various yield curves, prepayment rates, delinquency and default rates, recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral. 
 
 The potential effects of sustained inflation, elevated mortgage rates and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy actions may cause an increase in credit risk of our credit sensitive assets. Any future period of payment deferrals, forbearance, delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures or losses will likely adversely affect our net interest income from residential loans and RMBS investments, the fair value of these assets, our ability to liquidate the collateral that may underlie these investments and obtain additional financing and the future profitability of our investments. Further, in the event of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosure, regulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers and renters may slow or prevent us from taking remediation actions. 
 
 Prepayment risk 
 
 Premiums arise when we acquire real estate assets at a price in excess of the principal balance of the mortgages securing such assets (i.e., par value). Conversely, discounts arise when we acquire assets at a price below the principal balance of the mortgages securing such assets. Premiums paid on our assets are amortized against interest income and accretable purchase discounts on our assets are accreted to interest income. Purchase premiums or discounts on our assets are amortized or accreted over the life of each respective asset using the effective yield method, adjusted for actual prepayment activity. An increase in the prepayment rate, as measured by the CPR, will typically accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the yield or interest income earned on such assets. An increase in the prepayment rate will similarly accelerate the accretion of purchase discounts, conversely increasing the yield or interest income earned on such assets. A decrease in the prepayment rate will have a directionally opposite impact on the yield or interest income. 
 
 Differences between previously estimated cash flows and current actual and anticipated cash flows caused by changes to prepayment or other assumptions are adjusted retrospectively through a "catch up" adjustment for the impact of the cumulative change in the effective yield through the reporting date for securities accounted for under ASC 320-10 (generally, Agency RMBS) or adjusted prospectively through an adjustment of the yield over the remaining life of the investment for investments accounted for under ASC 325-40 (generally, Non-Agency RMBS and interest-only securities) and mortgage loans accounted for under ASC 310-10. 
 
 In addition, our interest rate hedges are structured in part based upon assumed levels of future prepayments within our mortgage loan or real estate securities portfolio. If prepayments are slower or faster than assumed, the life of the real estate securities or mortgage loans will be longer or shorter than assumed, respectively, which could reduce the effectiveness of our Manager s hedging strategies and may cause losses on such transactions. 
 
 Our Manager seeks to mitigate our prepayment risk by investing in real estate assets with a variety of prepayment characteristics. 
 
 Basis risk 
 
 Basis risk refers to the possible decline in book value triggered by the risk of incurring losses on the fair value of Agency RMBS as a result of widening market spreads between the yields on Agency RMBS and the yields on comparable duration Treasury securities. The basis risk associated with fluctuations in fair value of Agency RMBS may relate to factors impacting the mortgage and fixed income markets other than changes in benchmark interest rates, such as actual or anticipated monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve, market liquidity, or changes in required rates of return on different assets. Consequently, while we use interest rate swaps and other hedges to protect against moves in interest rates, such instruments will generally not protect our net book value against basis risk. 
 
 86 

Capital Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets, and our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock, preferred stock or other equity instruments. We are also exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets, and our related ability to finance our business through revolving facilities or other debt instruments. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore may require us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt and equity capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing, and terms of capital we raise. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information the Company is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 We have evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this quarterly report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
