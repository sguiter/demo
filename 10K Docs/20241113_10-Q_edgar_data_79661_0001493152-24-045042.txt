 NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

 (UNAUDITED) 

of the limited partnership interest of Justice through the acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest. Effective
December 23, 2021, the Partnership was dissolved. The financial statements of Justice were consolidated with those of the Company. 

Prior
to its dissolution effective December 23, 2021, Justice owned and operated a 544-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San
Francisco, California, known as the Hilton San Francisco Financial District (the Hotel and related facilities including
a five-level underground parking garage through its subsidiaries Justice Operating Company, LLC Operating and Justice
Mezzanine Company, LLC Mezzanine ). Mezzanine was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership; Operating is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Mezzanine. Effective December 23, 2021, Portsmouth replaced Justice as the single member of Mezzanine. Mezzanine is the
borrower under certain mezzanine indebtedness of Justice, and in December 2013, the Partnership conveyed ownership of the Hotel to Operating.
The Hotel is a full-service Hilton brand hotel pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement with HLT Franchise Holding LLC Hilton through January 31, 2030. 

Operating
entered into a hotel management agreement HMA with Aimbridge Hospitality Aimbridge to manage the Hotel,
along with its five-level parking garage, with an effective date of February 3, 2017. The term of the management agreement is for an
initial period of commencing on February 3, 2017 and . Under the terms on the HMA, base management fee payable to Aimbridge shall
be one and seven-tenths percent of total Hotel revenue. In addition to the Basic Fee, Aimbridge shall be entitled to an annual
incentive fee for each fiscal year equal to ten percent of the amount by which Gross Operating Profit in the current fiscal year
exceeds the previous fiscal year s Gross Operating Profit. 

However,
the Company after discussions with Aimbridge regarding a dispute in connection with the validity of the incentive fees as they relate
directly to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company and Aimbridge agreed that there was no incentive fees due to Aimbridge as the year-over-year
improvement resulted of the recovery from the pandemic. Therefore, Aimbridge agreed to waive that was previously recorded
and agreed to establish a performance threshold of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA that would be otherwise payable with respect to fiscal years 2019 through 2023. The waive reduction was made as of September 30, 2024. 

As
of September 30, 2024, The InterGroup Corporation InterGroup ), a public company, owns approximately of the outstanding
common shares of Portsmouth and the Company s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, John V. Winfield, owns approximately
 of the outstanding common shares of the Company. Mr. Winfield also serves as the President, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of InterGroup and owns approximately of the outstanding common shares of InterGroup as of September 30, 2024. 

There
have been no material changes to the Company s significant accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
Please refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 for a summary of the significant accounting
policies. 

net of
debt issuance costs .
Both loans matured on January 1, 2024, in addition, the Company has recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit of ,
which includes a 
increase adjustment made in December 2013 as a result of the partnership redemption. 

Due
to these factors and the Company s ability to successfully refinance the debt on favorable terms in the current lending environment
gives rise to substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the financial statement
issuance date. 

On
January 4, 2024, the Company was made aware of a notice of default (the Notice issued by its senior loan special servicer
LNR Partners, LLC to Justice Operating Company, LLC which is the wholly owned subsidiary of Portsmouth. The Notice states that the lender
has rights as a result of such defaults, including, but not limited to, acceleration of the loans, foreclosure on collateral and other
rights and remedies under the loan documents and otherwise available under the law. On January 10, 2024, the Company filed the required
Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the entire life of the outstanding debt, the Company has made all mortgage
payments timely as of the date of maturity and as of September 30, 2024, there were no delinquent amounts due to the senior or mezzanine
lenders. On April 29, 2024, the Company entered into forbearance agreements with its senior and mezzanine lenders which establishes,
among other customary terms, the new maturity date of January 1, 2025. While the Company successfully entered into the aforementioned
forbearance agreements, we continue our efforts to place a longer-term refinancing solution to its current senior mortgage and mezzanine
debt with potential lenders. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional liquidity when needed
or under acceptable terms, if at all. The Company is also in communications with its current lenders to explore the possibility of a
term extension from its maturity date of January 1, 2025. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Hotel has completed its full guest-rooms renovation over the last 2 years along with public space, fitness
center, corridors, and meeting space. The Hotel has begun to feel the impact of the renovation when it comes to average rate and calculated by multiplying the hotel s average daily room rate
by its occupancy percentage RevPAR growth since its completion. The Hotel continues to improve with the relocation of the business center into a meeting room and the space
being converted to a lounge area for guests in the lobby. On September 5, 2024, the Hotel received its annual Quality Assurance inspection
from Hilton and received the highest score at least in the Hotel s last decade at 94.45 which is an Outstanding 
ranking by Hilton. 

For
the quarter ending September 30, 2024, . The renovation has allowed the Hotel to be more competitive in a recovering market and push rates when demand allows it. The
Financial District hotels continue to outperform the market with the area showing positive year-over-year RevPAR growth compared to the
rest of the greater San Francisco market showing declines. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, and
reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern. 

. We
have taken several steps to preserve capital and increase liquidity at our Hotel, including implementing strict cost management measures
to eliminate non-essential expenses, renegotiating certain reoccurring expenses, and temporarily closing certain Hotel services and outlets.
As the hospitality and travel environment continues to slowly recover in San Francisco, we will continue to evaluate what services the
Company will bring back. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued to make capital improvements to the
Hotel in the amount of . 

The
Company had cash and cash equivalents of and as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Company
had restricted cash of and as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Company had marketable
securities of and as of September 30, 2024,and June 30, 2024, respectively. These marketable securities are short-term
investments and liquid in nature. 

On
July 2, 2014, the Partnership obtained from InterGroup an unsecured loan in the principal amount of at per year fixed
interest, with a term of years, payable interest only each month. InterGroup received a loan fee. The loan may be prepaid at any
time without penalty. . On December 16, 2020, the Partnership and InterGroup entered into a loan
modification agreement which increased the Partnership s borrowing from InterGroup as needed up to . On December 31,
2021, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Portsmouth s borrowing from InterGroup
as needed up to . Upon the dissolution of the Partnership in December 2021, Portsmouth assumed the Partnership s note
payable to InterGroup in the amount of . In July 2023, the note maturity date was extended to and the borrowing
amount available was increased to . The Company agreed to a loan extension and modification fee payable to InterGroup.
In March 2024, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Portsmouth s borrowing amount
to . Portsmouth agreed to a loan modification fee for the increased borrowing of payable to InterGroup. As
of June 30, 2024 the balance of the loan was net of loan amortization costs of zero. As of September 30, 2024 the balance
of the loan was and the Company has not made any paid-downs to its note payable to InterGroup. The Company could amend its
by-laws and increase the number of authorized shares to issue additional shares to raise capital in the public markets if needed. 

The
Company s known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures,
including management and franchise fees, corporate expenses, payroll and related costs, taxes, interest and principal payments on our
outstanding indebtedness, and repairs and maintenance of the Hotel. 

Our
long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities and capital improvements of
the Hotel. We will continue to finance our business activities primarily with existing cash, including from the activities described
above, and cash generated from our operations. The objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain existing leverage levels
and the availability of liquidity, while minimizing operational costs. However, there can be no guarantee that management will be successful
with its plan.

Performance
Obligations 

We
identified the following performance obligations for which revenue is recognized as the respective performance obligations are satisfied,
which results in recognizing the amount we expect to be entitled to for providing the goods or services: 

Cancelable room reservations or ancillary services are typically satisfied as the good or service is transferred to the Hotel
guest, which is generally when the room stay occurs. 

Non-cancelable room reservations and banquet or conference reservations represent a series of distinct goods or services provided
over time and satisfied as each distinct good or service is provided, which is reflected by the duration of the room reservation. 

Other ancillary goods and services are purchased independently of the room reservation at standalone selling prices and are considered
separate performance obligations, which are satisfied when the related good or service is provided to the Hotel guest. 

Components of package reservations for which each component could be sold separately to other Hotel guests are considered separate
performance obligations and are satisfied as set forth above. 

Hotel
revenue primarily consists of Hotel room rentals, revenue from accommodations sold in conjunction with other services (e.g., package
reservations), food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services (e.g., parking). Revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied
or goods and services have been delivered or rendered, respectively. Payment terms typically align with when the goods and services are
provided. For package reservations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations within the package based on the
estimated standalone selling prices of each component. 

We
do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an expected length of one year or less. Due to the
nature of our business, our revenue is not significantly impacted by refunds. Cash payments received in advance of guests staying at
our Hotel are refunded to Hotel guests if the guest cancels within the specified time before any services are rendered. Refunds related
to service are generally recognized as an adjustment to the transaction price at the time the hotel stay occurs or services are rendered. 

Contract
Assets and Liabilities 

The
Company does not have any material contract assets as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, other than trade and other receivables,
net on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our receivables are primarily the result of contracts with customers, which are reduced
by an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects our estimate of amounts that will not be collected. 

The
Company records contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of guests staying at our Hotel, which are presented
within accounts payable and other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and had a balance of at July 1, 2024.
During the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to as contract liabilities as advance for guests. The decrease was
driven by advance for services performed after June 30, 2024. Contract liabilities increased to as of September 30, 2023 from
 as of June 30, 2023. 

Contract
Costs 

We
consider sales commissions earned to be incremental costs of obtaining a contract with our customers. As a practical expedient, we expense
these costs as incurred as our contracts with customers are less than one year.

of . The prior Mezzanine Loan which had a per annum interest rate was paid off. Interest rate on the new mezzanine loan

Effective
May 11, 2017, InterGroup agreed to become an additional guarantor under the limited guaranty and an additional indemnitor under the environmental
indemnity for Justice Investors limited partnership s mortgage loan and the mezzanine loan. Pursuant to
the agreement, InterGroup is required to maintain certain net worth and liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, InterGroup is in compliance
with both requirements. Justice Operating Company, LLC has not been meeting certain of its loan covenants such as the Debt Service Coverage
Ratio DSCR which would trigger the creation of a lockbox by the Lender for all cash collected by the Hotel. However,
such lockbox has been created and utilized from the loan inception and will be in place up to loan maturity regardless of the DSCR. 

In
order to refinance the Hotel s aforementioned debt, in May 2024, the Company entered into a financing procurement agreement with
a global provider of financial advisory services to real estate owners. The Company will endeavor to refinance the aforementioned loans
prior to their new maturity. 

The
Company s Board of Directors is currently comprised of directors John V. Winfield, William J. Nance, John C. Love, Yvonne Murphy,
and Steve Grunwald. All the Company s directors also serve as directors of InterGroup. The Company s director and Chairman
of the Audit Committee, William J. Nance. 

John
V. Winfield serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company and InterGroup. Effective June 2016, Mr. Winfield became the
Managing Director of Justice until its dissolution in December 2021. Depending on certain market conditions and various risk factors,
the Chief Executive Officer and InterGroup may, at times, invest in the same companies in which the Company invests. The Company encourages
such investments because it places personal resources of the Chief Executive Officer and the resources of InterGroup, at risk in connection
with investment decisions made on behalf of the Company.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

The
Company s principal source of revenue continues to be derived from its ownership in Justice Operating Company, LLC Operating inclusive of hotel room revenue, food and beverage revenue, garage revenue, and revenue from other operating departments. Operating owns
the Hotel and related facilities, including a five-level underground parking garage. The financial statements of Operating have been
consolidated with those of the Company. 

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

The
Company had net loss of 1,872,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss of 1,560,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to the increased mortgage interest expense from the 4 default additional
interest rate on the senior and mezzanine loans as provided in the Forbearance Agreement entered into with its senior and mezzanine lenders
retroactive to January 1, 2024, and an increase in related party accrued interest expense due to a higher balance due to InterGroup.

Investment
Transactions 

The
Company had a net gain on marketable securities of 41,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss on marketable
securities of 88,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company unrealized

marketable securities for any given period may have no predictive value and variations in amount from period to period may have no analytical
value. For a more detailed description of the composition of the Company s marketable securities see the Marketable Securities
section below. 

The

in the Hotel. However, effective July 15, 2021, the Company become the owner of 100 of Justice and will include all the Hotel s
income and expense accounts into its income taxes calculations going forward. The income tax expense during the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 represent the income tax effect on the Company s pretax loss which includes the operations of the Hotel.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL SOURCES 

The
Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 6,888,000 and 4,775,000 as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.
The Company had marketable securities, net of margin due to securities brokers, of 207,000 and 209,000 as of September 30, 2024 and
June 30, 2024, respectively. These marketable securities are short-term investments and liquid in nature. 

On
July 2, 2014, the Partnership obtained from InterGroup an unsecured loan in the principal amount of 4,250,000 at 12 per year fixed
interest, with a term of 2 years, payable interest only each month. InterGroup received a 3 loan fee. The loan may be prepaid at any
time without penalty. The loan was extended to July 31, 2023. On December 16, 2020, the Partnership and InterGroup entered into a loan
modification agreement which increased the Partnership s borrowing from InterGroup as needed up to 10,000,000. On December 31,
2021, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Portsmouth s borrowing from InterGroup
as needed up to 16,000,000. Upon the dissolution of the Partnership in December 2021, Portsmouth assumed the Partnership s note
payable to InterGroup in the amount of 11,350,000. In July 2023, the note maturity date was extended to July 31, 2025 and the borrowing
amount available was increased to 20,000,000. The Company agreed to a 0.5 loan extension and modification fee payable to InterGroup.
In March 2024, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Portsmouth s borrowing amount
to 30,000,000. Portsmouth agreed to a 0.5 loan modification fee for the increased borrowing of 10,000,000 payable to InterGroup. As
of June 30, 2024 the balance of the loan was 26,493,000 net of loan amortization costs of zero. As of September 30, 2024 the balance
of the loan was 26,493,000 and the Company has not made any paid-downs to its note payable to InterGroup. 

Our
known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures, including management
and franchise fees, corporate expenses, payroll and related costs, taxes, interest and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness,
and repairs and maintenance of the Hotel. 

Our
long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities and capital improvements of
the Hotel. We will continue to finance our business activities primarily with existing cash, including from the activities described
above, and cash generated from our operations. The objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain existing leverage levels
and the availability of liquidity, while minimizing operational costs. We believe that our cash on hand, along with other potential sources
of liquidity that management may be able to obtain, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs. The Partnership obtained from
Intergroup has provided additional funding as needed to assist as a source of liquidity. As well as our capital lease and debt obligations,
even if current levels of occupancy and revenue per occupied room RevPAR , calculated by multiplying the hotel s
average daily room rate by its occupancy percentage) were to persist for at least the next twelve months and beyond. However, there can
be no guarantee that management will be successful with its plan. 

Going
Concern 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As discussed in Note 9 Related Party and Other
Financing Transactions, as of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance consists of a senior mortgage loan and mezzanine loan
totaling 100,546,000 net of debt issuance costs 340,000. Both loans matured on January 1, 2024, in addition, the Company has
recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit of 118,974,000, which includes a 64,100,000 increase adjustment made in December
2013 a s a result of the partnership redemption. 

- 19 - 

Due
to these factors and the uncertainty around the Company s ability to successfully refinance the debt on favorable terms in the
current lending environment gives rise to substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one
year after the financial statement issuance date. 

On
January 4, 2024, the Company was made aware of a notice of default (the Notice issued by its senior loan special servicer
LNR Partners, LLC to Justice Operating Company, LLC which is the wholly owned subsidiary of Portsmouth. The Notice states that the lender
has rights as a result of such defaults, including, but not limited to, acceleration of the loans, foreclosure on collateral and other
rights and remedies under the loan documents and otherwise available under the law. On January 10, 2024, the Company filed the required
Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the entire life of the outstanding debt, the Company has made all mortgage
payments timely as of the date of maturity and as of September 30, 2024, there were no delinquent amounts due to the senior or mezzanine
lenders. On April 29, 2024, the Company entered into forbearance agreements with its senior and mezzanine lenders which establishes,
among other customary terms, the new maturity date of January 1, 2025. While the Company successfully entered into the aforementioned
forbearance agreements, we continue our efforts to place a longer-term refinancing solution to its current senior mortgage and mezzanine
debt with potential lenders. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional liquidity when needed
or under acceptable terms, if at all. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Hotel has completed its full guest-rooms renovation over the last 2 years along with public space, fitness
center, corridors, and meeting space. The Hotel has begun to feel the impact of the renovation when it comes to average rate and RevPAR
growth since its completion. The Hotel continues to improve with the relocation of the business center into a meeting room and the space
being converted to a lounge area for guests in the lobby. On September 5, 2024, the Hotel received its annual Quality Assurance inspection
from Hilton and received the highest score at least in the Hotel s last decade at 94.45 which is an Outstanding 
ranking by Hilton. 

For
the quarter ending September 30, 2024, the hotel achieved a RevPAR index of 145 while increasing the ADR index to 90 . The Hotel s year-to-date
RevPAR index is 118 . For the quarter ending September 30, 2024, the Hotel gained RevPAR year over year by 5.7 while its Comp Set was
-18.5 . The renovation has allowed the Hotel to be more competitive in a recovering market and push rates when demand allows it. The
Financial District hotels continue to outperform the market with the area showing positive year-over-year RevPAR growth compared to the
rest of the greater San Francisco market showing declines. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, and
reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern.

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

- 20 - 

IMPACT
OF INFLATION 

Hotel
room rates are typically impacted by supply and demand factors, not inflation, since rental of a hotel room is usually for a limited
number of nights. Room rates can be, and usually are, adjusted to account for inflationary cost increases. Since Aimbridge has the power
and ability under the terms of its management agreement to adjust Hotel room rates on an ongoing basis, there should be minimal impact
on partnership revenues due to inflation. For the two most recent fiscal years, the impact of inflation on the Company s income
is not viewed by management as material. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES 

Critical
accounting policies are those that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require
judgments by management in order to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to the consolidation of our subsidiaries, to our revenues, allowances
for bad debts, accruals, asset impairments, other investments, income taxes and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates
or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical
accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

INCOME
TAXES 

Judgment
is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or
tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws, or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject
to examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters
could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return
to determine whether they are more likely than not of being sustained, assuming that the tax reporting positions will be examined by
taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information, prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial
statements. If a position does not meet the more likely than not standard, the benefit cannot be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and
the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the
provision for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard with respect to a position
could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 

DEFERRED
INCOME TAXES VALUATION ALLOWANCE 

We
assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that
some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable. This assessment is completed by tax jurisdiction and relies on the weight
of both positive and negative evidence available, with significant weight placed on recent financial results. Cumulative pre-tax losses
for the three-year period are considered significant objective negative evidence that some or all of our deferred tax assets may not
be realizable. Cumulative reported pre-tax income is considered objectively verifiable positive evidence of our ability to generate positive
pre-tax income in the future. In accordance with GAAP, when there is a recent history of pre-tax losses, there is little or no weight
placed on forecasts for purposes of assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. When necessary, we use systematic and logical
methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse
and generate tax deductions. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required when scheduling the reversal of deferred tax
assets and liabilities, and the exercise is inherently complex and subjective. However, significant judgment will be required to determine
the timing and amount of any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods. 

- 21 - 

HOTEL
ASSETS AND DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

We
evaluate property and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly, and when events or circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable, we evaluate the net book value of the assets by comparing to the projected undiscounted cash
flows of the assets. We use judgment to determine whether indications of impairment exist and consider our knowledge of the hospitality
industry, historical experience, location of the property, market conditions, and property-specific information available at the time
of the assessment. The results of our analysis could vary from period to period depending on how our judgment is applied and the facts
and circumstances available at the time of the analysis. When an indicator of impairment exists, judgment is also required in determining
the assumptions and estimates to use within the recoverability analysis and when calculating the fair value of the asset or asset group,
if applicable. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the judgments used could result in impairments to our long-lived
assets in future periods. Historically, changes in estimates used in the property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets
impairment assessment process have not resulted in material impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of changes made to those
estimates. There were no indicators of impairment on its hotel investments or intangible assets and accordingly no impairment losses
recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

4. Controls and Procedures 

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The
Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has
evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under

to management and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms. 

CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There
have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the last quarterly period covered by this

PART II 

 OTHER
INFORMATION 

Item
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Portsmouth
Square, Inc., through its operating company Justice Investors Operating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Company ),
is the owner of the real property located at 750 Kearny Street in San Francisco, currently improved with a 27 story building
which houses a Hilton Hotel (the Property ). The Property was purchased and improved pursuant to the terms of a series of
agreements with the City and County of San Francisco (the City in the early 1970 s. The terms of the agreements
and subsequent approvals and permits included a condition by which the Company was required to construct an ornamental overhead pedestrian
bridge across Kearny Street, connecting the Property to a nearby City park and underground parking garage known as Portsmouth Square
(the Bridge ). Included in the approval process was the City s issuance of a Major Encroachment Permit Permit allowing the Bridge to span over Kearney Street. As of May 24, 2022, the City has purported to revoke the Permit and on June 13, 2022,
has directed the Company to submit a general bridge removal and restoration plan (the Plan at the Company s expense.
The Company disputes the legality of the purported revocation of the Permit. The Company further disputes the existence of any legal
or contractual obligation to remove the Bridge at its expense. In particular, representatives of the Company participated in meetings
with the City on and at various times after August 1, 2019, to discuss a collaborative process for the possible removal of the Bridge.
Until the purported revocation of the Permit in 2022, the City representatives repeatedly and consistently promised and agreed that the
City will pay for the associated costs of any Bridge removal. Nevertheless, without waiving any rights, in an effort to understand all
of the available options, and to provide a response to the City s directives, the Company has engaged a Project Manager, a structural
engineering firm and an architect to advise on the development of a Plan for the Bridge removal, as well as the reconstruction of the
front of the Hilton Hotel. The Company has been working cooperatively with the City on the process for removal of the Bridge and its
related physical encroachments, including obtaining regulatory approvals and permits. The Company is currently in discussion with the
City regarding both the process and financial responsibility for the implementation of the Plan and reconstruction of the impacted portions
of the Hotel. Those discussions are expected to continue at least through the end of 2024. A final Plan is currently not expected to
be completed until late 2024, and permits are unlikely to be obtained until early 2025 at the earliest.

The
Company may be subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company will defend
itself vigorously against any such claims. Management does not believe that the impact of such matters will have a material effect on
the financial conditions or result of operations when resolved.
