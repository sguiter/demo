 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Fair value is a market-based measure considered
from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily
available, the Partnership s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability at the measurement date. The Partnership uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including prices
and inputs during periods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced
for many assets and liabilities. This condition could cause an asset or liability to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair
value hierarchy. 

The Partnership values futures and options on
futures contracts at the closing price of the contract s primary exchange. The Partnership generally includes futures and options
on futures contracts in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as they are exchange traded derivatives. 

Forward currency contracts are valued at the mean
between the bid and ask prices, which approximates fair value. Interpolated values are derived when the settlement date of the contract
is an interim date for which quotations are not available. The Partnership includes forward currency contracts in Level 2 of the fair
value hierarchy. 

The fair value of U.S. government securities is
based on quoted prices in active markets. When quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that
uses inputs that include interest-rate yield curves, cross-currency-basis index spreads, and country credit spreads similar to the bond
in terms of issue, maturity and seniority. U.S. government securities are generally categorized in Levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The fair value of corporate notes is determined
using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), notes spreads or credit default swap spreads. The spread
data used are for the same maturity as that of the notes. If the spread data does not reference the issuer, data that references a comparable
issuer is used. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves,
bond, or single-name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates based on collateral values as key inputs. These valuation methods
represent both a market and income approach to fair value measurement. Corporate notes are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy;
however, in instances where significant inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in Level 3 of the hierarchy. As of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, the Partnership did not hold corporate notes. 

The fair value of certificates of deposit is determined
based on a constant maturity curve for comparable instruments denominated in USD. This valuation method represents both a market and income
approach to fair value measurement. Certificates of deposit are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities
are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. 

There were no changes to the Partnership s
valuation methodology during the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

With respect to futures contracts and options
on futures contracts, the Partnership has entered into an agreement with the Clearing Broker which grants the Clearing Broker the right
to offset recognized derivative assets and derivative liabilities if certain conditions exist, which would require the Clearing Broker
to liquidate the Partnership s positions. These events include the following: (i) the Clearing Broker is directed or required by
a regulatory or self-regulatory organization, (ii) the Clearing Broker determines, at its discretion, that the risk in the Partnership s
account must be reduced for protection of the Clearing Broker, (iii) upon the Partnership s breach or failure to perform on its
contractual agreements with the Clearing Broker, (iv) upon the commencement of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding for the protection
of creditors against the Partnership, or (v) upon the dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or merger of the Partnership. 

With respect to foreign currency forward
contracts, the Partnership has entered into an agreement with the Clearing Broker, whereby the party having the greater obligation (either
the Partnership or the Clearing Broker) shall deliver to the other party at the settlement date the net amount of recognized derivative
assets and liabilities.

PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
(continued) 

Item 2: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations . 

Reference is made to Item 1: Financial
Statements. The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis. 

Liquidity 

The Partnership s assets are generally held
as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Partnership s futures positions and are sold to pay redemptions and expenses
as needed. Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Partnership s assets are highly liquid and are
expected to remain so. Market-imposed limitations, when they occur, can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or
to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership s futures trading. A portion of the Partnership s
assets not used for margin and held with the Custodian are invested in liquid, high quality securities. Through September 30, 2024, the
Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the markets traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership. 

Capital Resources 

The Partnership raises additional capital only
through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income. The Partnership does not
engage in borrowing. 

The amount of capital raised for the Partnership
should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements
other than for capital to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses. Within broad ranges of capitalization, the Partnership s
trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership. 

The Partnership participates in the speculative
trading of commodity futures contracts, options on futures contracts and forward contracts, substantially all of which are subject to
margin requirements. The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors
by the respective exchanges. Further, the Partnership s futures commission merchants and brokers may require margin in excess of
minimum exchange requirements. 

Contracts currently traded by the Advisor on behalf
of the Partnership include exchange-traded futures contracts and over-the-counter forward currency contracts. The risks associated with
exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter
transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its trading counterparties, whereas exchange-traded contracts are generally,
but not universally, backed by the collective credit of the members of the exchange. The credit risk from counterparty non-performance
associated with the Partnership s over-the-counter forward currency transactions is the net unrealized gain on such contracts plus
related collateral held by the counterparty. 

The Partnership bears the risk of financial failure
by the Clearing Broker and Soci t G n rale SA (SG) (which may from time to time execute spot and other over-the-counter
foreign exchange transactions as a counterparty to the Partnership) and/or other clearing brokers or counterparties with which the Partnership
trades. 

Results of Operations 

The Partnership s success depends primarily
upon the Advisor s ability to recognize and capitalize on market trends in the sectors of the global commodity futures markets in
which it trades. The Partnership seeks to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income. The past performance
of the Partnership is not necessarily indicative of future results. 

Due to the nature of the Partnership s trading, the results of
operations for the interim period presented should not be considered indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.

Performance Summary 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 

During the third quarter of 2024, the Partnership
achieved net realized and unrealized loss of 785,663 from its trading activities, and net of brokerage commissions of 58,422. The Partnership
accrued total expenses of 140,899 including 41,879 in management fees paid to the General Partner, 0 in incentive fees, and 99,020
in service, professional fees and other expenses. The Partnership earned 182,490 in interest income during the third quarter of 2024.
An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for the third quarter
of 2024 is set forth below. 

Third Quarter 2024. MSCI World climbed 6.4 led
by the rate-sensitive utilities and real estate sectors, the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index gained 7.0 as bond yields decreased,
and credit spreads tightened around the world. A dovish outlook for US rates also led to a weaker dollar, particularly against the Japanese
yen. The weaker dollar affected commodities as well, as gold rallied to new highs and silver prices rose to the highest levels since 2012.
Coffee and orange juice prices, which have trended upward for most of the year due to bad weather in the growing regions, continued to
increase. The performance of the rest of the metals and agricultural commodities was more mixed, with most declining in the first half
of the quarter and rallying in the second half. In the energy sector, oil and oil products slid downward. 

These conditions made the third quarter challenging
for trend-following strategies due to the unwinding of longer-term downtrends in fixed income and non-USD currencies and sharp reversals
in equity indices and currencies. Against this backdrop, profitable trends in precious metals and strong performance from non-trend signals
in agriculture and energy were insufficient to offset the losses elsewhere. 

Negative performance in currencies and fixed income
resulted from the reversal of two long-standing trends: dollar strength and rising bond yields. Except for a brief period early in 2024,
the Partnership s fixed income exposure has been net short since 2021 and mostly long the US dollar. These trend reversals led to
reductions and a switch to net long exposure around during August. Trend-following CTAs were caught off guard in early August, when the
Japanese yen soared versus most major currencies and equity indices, particularly in Japan. The event also explained part of the negative
performance in equity indices during the quarter, as the Partnership s directional trend-following signals were whipsawed. Most
of the remaining negative performance in equity indices during the quarter was due to cross-sectional trend-following signals. 

The performance of agricultural commodities and
precious metals was more favorable during the quarter. The Partnership profited in agriculture due to increased exposure to trends in
coffee, soybeans, and cocoa from diversifying signals. Profits in precious metals, meanwhile, were concentrated in gold. Non-trend signals
in energies were another bright spot for performance due to mean reversion signals performing well in oil products and US natural gas.
Heading into the fourth quarter, the Partnership is net long fixed income, stock indices, and precious metals, and net short the US dollar
and energies. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

During the third quarter of 2023, the Partnership
achieved net realized and unrealized gains of 452,769 from its trading activities, and net of brokerage commissions of 60,763. The
Partnership accrued total expenses of 251,796 including 47,327 in management fees paid to the General Partner, 91,245 in incentive
fees, and 113,224 in service, professional fees and other expenses. The Partnership earned 201,085 in interest income during the third
quarter of 2023. An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for
the third quarter of 2023 is set forth below. 

Third Quarter 2023. The Partnership was up during
the third quarter of 2023, providing diversification alongside declines in global bond and equity indices. Higher interest rate signaling
from central bankers put upward pressure on government bond yields and led to declines across most regional stock indices. US 10-year
Treasury yields rose to 4.5 , a 16 year high. The US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, most notably versus the Japanese
yen, British pound, and euro as a response to the ongoing Fed hawkishness. 

30 

Saudi Arabia and Russia surprised markets by cutting
oil production through to the end of year and oil and oil product prices rallied between 20 and 45 . Industrial commodities were boosted
by Chinese government rate cuts and property sector support, and crops in regions where yields are likely to be negatively because of
this year s El Ni o weather pattern continued to rally. 

Diversifying signals drove the Partnership s
performance in the third quarter. Sectors where positioning across both trend following and systematic macro was on the right side of
price action were the biggest contributors to performance, namely fixed income, energies, and agriculture. At the same time, non-trend
signals provided valuable diversification across currencies, precious metals, base metals, and stock indices. Carry and signals based
on market dynamics were notable contributors in currencies and precious metals. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of 425,412 from its trading activities, and net of brokerage commissions of
 176,697. The Partnership accrued total expenses of 652,822 including 133,731 in management fees paid to the General Partner, 204,948
in incentive fees, and 314,143 in service and professional fees. The Partnership earned 579,041 in interest income during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities
for the third quarter of 2024 is set forth below. 

Third Quarter 2024. 

During the quarter, MSCI World climbed
6.4 led by the rate-sensitive utilities and real estate sectors, the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index gained 7.0 as bond yields
decreased, and credit spreads tightened around the world. A dovish outlook for US rates also led to a weaker dollar, particularly against

Heading into the fourth quarter, the Partnership is net long fixed income, stock indices, and precious metals, and net short the US dollar
and energies. 

31 

Second Quarter 2024. 

The Partnership was down during the second quarter
of 2024. The interaction between expectations for economic growth and interest rates continued to drive price action during the quarter.
With US mega-cap technology stocks leading the way, the MSCI World stock index rose 2.6 during the quarter to new highs. Hong Kong, Singaporean,
and Indian indices also delivered strong performance. Other segments of the market, notably US small caps, French equities, and the global
materials and real estate sectors were more challenged during the quarter. Yields on US 10-year Treasury notes rose above 4.5 again during
the first half of the quarter. This hawkish shift in the United States also put pressure on the Japanese yen, which weakened to its lowest
level against the dollar since 1986. Other notable currency moves included declines in the Mexican peso and Brazilian real amid concerns
about judicial reform from a new government in Mexico and the risk of unsustainable government spending in Brazil. In commodities, metal
prices mostly rose over the quarter, while in energies, European power and gas prices soared after an outage at a gas processing plant
in Norway. Oil and oil products, on the other hand, were flat to negative. Coffee and US dairy markets posted the most significant gains
in the agricultural sector, rising by 20 or more. In contrast, cocoa rose above 11,000 per ton in April before giving back its gains
to end the quarter down double digits. 

The Partnership s core trend-following component
drove the negative performance in the second quarter due to reversals across energies, agriculture, and equity indices. At the same time,
non-trend signals offered negligible diversification in energies and agriculture; they mitigated losses in equity indices and explained
a positive performance in fixed income. Currencies were the top-contributing sector due to trend-following and diversifying signals being
on the right side of price action. The positive performance in currencies was driven by short exposure to the Japanese yen versus most
significant currencies across trend following and diversifying signals. While there was model diversification within the diversifying
component, where signals based on market fundamentals and dynamics were primarily long, these were overshadowed by the strongest short
carry signals in decades. Meanwhile, the gains in fixed income were driven by a range of diversifying signals, with seasonality performing
exceptionally well. However, the trend following was flat in the sector overall due to losses in South Africa and the Czech Republic canceling
out profits in the United States, Latin America, and Australia. 

Energies and agriculture were the top-detracting
sectors, with trend following and diversifying signals on the wrong side of price action. Many oil products were down slightly over the
three months, which weighed on the strategy s net long positioning, while power and carbon emissions reversals detracted from the
alternative markets portfolio. In agriculture, longs in hogs and cotton and a short wheat position led the losses. At the same time, a
steady reduction in cocoa positions since February meant that most of the year-to-date profits were effectively locked in by the time
the market reversed in April. Specialist commodity strategies introduced in the second quarter were a bright spot across the two sectors,
particularly a weather-based strategy trading gas and power markets. 

First Quarter 2024. 

The Partnership was up during the first quarter
of 2024. Global equities rose to all-time highs during the quarter amid optimism around corporate earnings growth and lower inflation.
Yields on government bonds generally rose over the three months as investors scaled back expectations for rate cuts in 2024, and the US
dollar strengthened against most major currencies, particularly the Japanese yen. The interest rate differential between the United States
and Japan put continued pressure on the yen as the Bank of Japan hiked rates into positive territory for the first time in eight years.
Lastly, commodity market performance was mixed. Gold and oil prices saw healthy increases, and cocoa prices doubled after a weather-induced
shortage. On the other hand, grain prices fell after better-than-expected harvests, and commodities sensitive to demand from the Chinese
property sector such as iron ore, glass, and steel declined. 

Partnership profits were split between the core
trend-following component and the diversifying signals, which continue to contribute positively to the Partnership s returns despite
a lower risk allocation than the trend-following component. Trend following performed strongly as equity indices continued to trend higher.
Diversifying signals in agricultural commodities, energies, and currencies boosted returns. Elsewhere, losses from trend-following in
fixed income were mitigated by solid performance from diversifying signals.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of 1,475,441 from its trading activities, and net of brokerage commissions
of 182,802. The Partnership accrued total expenses of 633,602 including 142,144 in management fees paid to the General Partner,
 145,792 in incentive fees, and 345,666 in service and professional fees. The Partnership earned 529,152 in interest income during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures
trading activities for the third quarter of 2023 is set forth below. 

Third Quarter 2023. The Partnership was up during
the third quarter of 2023, providing diversification alongside declines in global bond and equity indices. Higher interest rate signaling
from central bankers put upward pressure on government bond yields and led to declines across most regional stock indices. US 10-year
Treasury yields rose to 4.5 , a 16 year high. The US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, most notably versus the Japanese
yen, British pound, and euro as a response to the ongoing Fed hawkishness. 

Saudi Arabia and Russia surprised markets by cutting
oil production through to the end of year and oil and oil product prices rallied between 20 and 45 . Industrial commodities were boosted
by Chinese government rate cuts and property sector support, and crops in regions where yields are likely to be negatively because of
this year s El Ni o weather pattern continued to rally. 

Diversifying signals drove the Partnership s
performance in the third quarter. Sectors where positioning across both trend following and systematic macro was on the right side of
price action were the biggest contributors to performance, namely fixed income, energies, and agriculture. At the same time, non-trend
signals provided valuable diversification across currencies, precious metals, base metals, and stock indices. Carry and signals based
on market dynamics were notable contributors in currencies and precious metals. 

Second Quarter 2023. The Partnership was up in
the second quarter of 2023. In markets, currencies were among the biggest market movers during the quarter in risk-adjusted terms, with
the Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, and Turkish lira weakening against the U.S. dollar. As the People s Bank of China and Bank of Japan
maintained a loose monetary policy, the lira fell to new record lows versus the dollar after the president s re-election. Yields
on developed market government bonds resumed their 2022 uptrend as U.S. policymakers signaled the hiking cycle may continue, and commodity
prices mostly fell as prospects of a global economic slowdown loomed. Mega-cap technology stocks, boosted by hype around generative A.I.,
led global equity markets higher during the quarter. 

Trend-following systems rebounded in the second
quarter as longer-term trends across most sectors resumed, particularly in financials. Systematic macro signals also made a notable contribution,
enhancing returns across the financials and agricultural commodities sectors. Carry and mean reversion were the top-performing signals
within the systematic macro component. 

Currencies, agricultural commodities, and fixed
income led the Partnership s gains due to favorable positioning across our trend-following and systematic macro clusters. Stock
indices, base metals, and credit were other sources of profits, due mainly to trend following. Short Japanese yen positions accounted
for most of the gains in F.X. The yen is trending towards its October 2022 lows versus the U.S. dollar, as the Bank of Japan s easy
policy stance continues to contrast with the U.S. Federal Reserve. Further profits accrued from short exposure to the Chinese yuan and
long British pound and Mexican peso positioning. Softs and livestock drove the strategy s positive performance in agriculture, where
long cocoa, sugar, and cattle positions were among the most significant contributors. 

First Quarter 2023. The Partnership experienced
losses during the first quarter of 2023. Speculation around the global rate trajectory in 2023 drove financial markets for most of the
first quarter, as equity and bond prices moved up and down in tandem. The demise of Silicon Valley Bank, however, interrupted this dynamic
and triggered declines in stocks and the largest two-day rally in short-dated US Treasuries since the 1980s. Commodities were mixed during
the quarter: gold, copper and softs rallied, while energies, grains and oilseeds declined. 

33 

The partnership s net short exposure to
fixed income, combined with positioning on the wrong side of market movements in metals, drove negative performance during the quarter.
A long and steady uptrend in yields, which began at the end of 2021 and continued through to February 2023, abruptly reversed across March
10 and 13 notably at the shorter end of the US curve. The Partnership was whipsawed in base metals and precious metals, with net positioning
scaling up before reducing and switching direction in both sectors during the quarter. Gold, platinum, and lead were the top detractors.
The Partnership made money in agricultural commodities and energies over the quarter, due to a combination of systematic macro and trend
following signals. Long sugar and cocoa positions and short hogs and wheat positions led the gains in agricultural commodities, where
a wide range of systems were profitable, particularly those based on mean reversion, carry and fundamentals. Trend-following also made
money in the sector overall. A small profit in energies, meanwhile, accrued mostly from mean reversion in major energy markets and trend
following on natural gas and power markets. 

The SG Trend Index fell 9.2 across Friday, March
10, 2023, and Monday, March 13, 2023, the worst two-day performance since its 2000 inception. It was a similar story for the SG CTA Index,
which lost a record 7.5 across the two days. The Partnership was not immune to the sharp reversal in bond yields, as previously described.
Yet industry returns across those two days and the month suggest that the Partnership has held up well, even when accounting for different
 typical risk levels. We believe this resilience is testament to the risk management framework developed over the past 25
years.
