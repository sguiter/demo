Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

We
have made statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements convey our current expectations or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking
statements include statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, pending, threatened, and current litigation,
liquidity, budgets, projected revenue and costs, plans and objectives of management for future operations. The words may, 
 continue, estimate, intend, plan, will, believe, 
 project, expect, anticipate , and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements,
but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

The
forward-looking statements contained in or incorporated by reference are largely based on our expectations, which reflect estimates and
assumptions made by management. These estimates and assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions
and other factors. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve several
risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control, including: 

our
 ability to improve, market and commercialize our products, and achieve and sustain profitability; 

our
 continued improvement of our proprietary technologies, and expected continued use of cash from operating activities unless or until
 we achieve positive cash flow from the commercialization of our products and services; 

our
 ability to obtain additional funding, as and if needed, which will be subject to several factors, including market conditions, our
 financial condition and our operating performance; 

the
 substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern; 

our
 history of operating losses, which we expect to continue for at least the short term and possibly longer; 

our
 ability to manage challenges and expenses associated with communications and disputes with activist shareholders, including litigation; 

our
 ability to manage and mitigate risks associated with our internal cyber security protocols and protection of the data we collect
 and distribute; 

our
 ability to protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

the
 impact of inflation related to the U.S. dollar on our business, operations, customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and personnel; 

our
 ability to meet product enhancement, manufacturing and customer delivery deadlines and the potential impact due to disruptions to
 our supply chain or our ability to identify vendors that can assist with the prefabrication elements of our products, as a result
 of, among other things, staff shortages, order delays, and increased pricing from vendors and manufacturers; 

our
 forecasts and estimates regarding future expenses, revenue, gross margin, cash flow and capital requirements; 

our
 ability to identify and penetrate markets for our products, services, and solutions; 

our
 ability to effectively respond to competition in our targeted markets; 

our
 ability to establish relationships with our existing and future strategic partners which may not be successful; 

our
 ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American; 

the
 reliability and continuous improvement of our technology, products and solutions; 

our
 ability to increase or more efficiently utilize the synergies available from our product lines: 

changes
 in current legislation, regulations and economic conditions that affect the demand for, or restrict the use of our products; 

our
 ability to expand markets across geographic boundaries; 

our
 ability to be successful with Federal government work which is complex due to various statutes and regulations applicable to doing
 business with the Federal government; 

our
 ability to be successful doing business internationally which requires strict compliance with applicable import, export, ITAR, anti-bribery
 and related statutes and regulations; 

the
 current geopolitical world uncertainty, including Russia s invasion of Ukraine, the Israel/Palestine conflict and previous
 attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea; 

our
 ability to hire and retain key personnel, including senior management, to achieve our business objectives; and 

our
 ability to establish and maintain consistent commercial profit margins. 

Any
or all of our forward-looking statements in this report may turn out to be inaccurate. We have based these forward-looking statements
largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial
condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. They may be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make
or unknown risks and uncertainties, including the risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in Item 1A Risk Factors 
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024, and in our subsequent reports under the Exchange Act. In light of
these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this report may not occur as contemplated
and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied by the forward-looking statements. 

Many
of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the general
or specific factors that may affect us. You should not unduly rely on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
of this filing. Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect
new information or future events or otherwise.

million, and used cash in operations of approximately 
million. Cash used in operations includes cash payments of the earnout payable to the former shareholders of Marine Advanced
Robotics Inc. (CA), referred to herein as MAR, of 
and partial payment of the fiscal 2024 bonus for all employees. In addition, the Company has continued to make investments to
support order backlog and future growth. 

The
Company s future results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Company s
future operating results and could cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, performance
of its products, its ability to market and commercialize its products and new products that it may develop, access to capital, technology
development, scalability of technology and production, ability to attract and retain key personnel, concentration of customers and suppliers,
pending or threatened litigation, and deployment risks and integration of acquisitions. 

For
the six months ended October 31, 2024 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, the Company has obtained additional capital financing
through our capital raises with certain investors. However, management believes the Company s current cash, cash equivalents,
and restricted cash balances at October 31, 2024 of million may not be sufficient to fund its planned expenditures through December
2025. 

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon the Company s operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations
and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a basis which assumes the Company is a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from
any uncertainty related to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material. 

During
the six months ended October 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately million and used cash in operations of approximately
 million. In addition, the Company has continued to make investments to build inventory, support order backlog and future growth. 

The
Company s future results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Company s
future operating results and could cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, performance
of its products, its ability to market and commercialize its products and new products that it may develop, access to capital, technology
development, scalability of technology and production, ability to attract and retain key personnel, concentration of customers and suppliers,
pending or threatened litigation, and deployment risks and integration of acquisitions. 

On
March 21, 2024, the Company entered into an At-the-Market Offering Agreement with an aggregate offering price of up to 
million (the 2023 ATM Facility ). On August 30, 2024 the aggregate offering price under the 2023 ATM Facility
was increased to approximately 
million. It was then reduced to approximately 
million in September 2024 and increased again to approximately 
million in December 2024. As of October 31, 2024, the Company had received proceeds of approximately 
million under this facility and an additional 
million between October 31, 2024 and December 13, 2024. 

First
Registered Direct Offering 

On
September 13, 2024, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the First RDO Purchase Agreement with
an institutional accredited investor for the sale (the First Offering by the Company of shares (the First RDO
Shares of the Company s common stock, par value per
share (the Common Stock ), for aggregate gross proceeds of 
million before deducting offering expenses
payable by the Company. The First RDO Shares were issued upon issuance of a funding notice by the Company to the investor. In
addition, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to this investor up to an additional 
million of shares of Common Stock on the
same pricing terms. 

The
First RDO Purchase Agreement contained customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company and customary conditions for
closing. Pursuant to the First RDO Purchase Agreement, the Company also agreed to indemnify the purchaser against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act and liabilities arising from breaches of representations and warranties contained therein.
The First RDO Purchase Agreement included a waiver to the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan as well as a covenant on the investor to vote their shares of common stock in favor of all Company
director nominees and other proxy proposals, but only for so long as the investor owns more than 5 of the outstanding stock. 

The
Company can use the net proceeds from this sale to build additional products and solutions to meet market demand, further advance
the development of new products and solutions, engage in corporate development and merger and acquisition activities, for working
capital needs, capital expenditures, repayment or refinancing of indebtedness, repurchases and redemptions of securities, and for
other general corporate purposes. 

Second
Registered Direct Offering 

On
September 13, 2024, the Company also entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the Second RDO Purchase
Agreement with a separate institutional accredited investor for the sale (the Second Offering by the Company
of shares (the Second RDO Shares of the Common Stock, for aggregate gross proceeds of million,
before deducting offering expenses payable by the Company. The Second RDO Shares were issued upon issuance of a funding notice by
the Company to the investor. In addition, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to this
investor up to an additional 
million of shares of Common Stock on the same pricing terms. 

The
Second RDO Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company and customary conditions
to closing. Pursuant to the Second RDO Purchase Agreement, the Company also agreed to indemnify the purchaser against certain

Restricted
Cash and Security Agreements 

The
Company has a letter of credit agreement with Santander Bank, N.A. Santander ). Cash of is on deposit at Santander
and serves as security for a letter of credit issued by Santander for the lease of warehouse/office space in Monroe Township, New Jersey. 

In
the prior years, Santander also issued a letter of credit to subsidiaries of Enel Green Power EGP pursuant to the Company s
contracts with EGP. A letter of credit was issued in the amount of and was reduced to in August 2020. The letter of
credit was further reduced by an additional in January 2023, when the legacy PB3 PowerBuoy PB3 and its

and of the Company s
total revenues for the respective periods. For the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had six and four customers,
respectively, whose revenues accounted for at least 10 of the Company s consolidated revenues. These revenues accounted for approximately
 and of the Company s total revenues for the respective periods. 

million and million, respectively. For the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the
aggregate share-based compensation expense was approximately million and million, respectively. The Company s policy
is to account for forfeitures of share-based compensation as they occur. 

Additionally,
upon vesting of Restricted Stock Units RSU that were granted to an employee, the employee is given the option to either
pay the taxes themselves, or have enough shares of their RSU award withheld by the Company to cover the taxes incurred by the employee.
In the event the employee elects to surrender shares to cover the tax implication, the Company maintains those shares in the Company s
treasury stock account. Shares held in the Company s treasury stock account are not available for future RSU grants. 

The
Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a good or service to a customer, either (1)
at a point in time or (2) over time. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control. The evaluation of whether
control of each performance obligation is transferred at a point in time or over time is made at contract inception. Input measures such
as costs incurred are utilized to assess progress against specific contractual performance obligations for the Company s services.
The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the services to be
provided. For the Company, the input method using costs or labor hours incurred best represents the measure of progress against the performance
obligations incorporated within the contractual agreements. If estimated total costs on any contract project a loss, the Company charges
the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss becomes known. The cumulative effect of revisions to revenue, estimated
costs to complete contracts, including penalties, change orders, claims, anticipated losses, and others are recorded in the accounting
period in which the events indicating a loss are known and the loss can be reasonably estimated. These loss projections are re-assessed
for each subsequent reporting period until the project is complete. Such revisions could occur at any time and the effects may be material.
During the six-month period ended October 31, 2024, the Company recognized approximately million in revenue related to performance
obligations satisfied at a point in time and approximately million in revenue related to performance obligations satisfied over
time. During the three-month period ended October 31, 2024, the Company recognized approximately million in revenue related to performance
obligations satisfied at a point in time and approximately million in revenue related to performance obligations satisfied over
time. 

The
Company s contracts are either cost-plus contracts, fixed-price contracts, time and material agreements, lease or service agreements.
Under cost plus contracts, customers are billed for actual expenses incurred plus an agreed-upon fee. 

The
Company has two types of fixed-price contracts, firm fixed-price and cost-sharing. Under firm fixed-price contracts, the Company
receives an agreed-upon amount for providing products and services specified in the contract, and a profit or loss is recognized
depending on whether actual costs are more or less than the agreed-upon amount. Under cost-sharing contracts, the fixed amount
agreed upon with the customer is only intended to fund a portion of the costs on a specific project. Under cost-sharing contracts,
an amount corresponding to the revenue is recorded in cost of revenue, resulting in gross profit on these contracts of zero. The
Company reports its disaggregation of revenue by contract type since this method best represents the Company s business. For
the six-month periods ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of the Company s contracts were classified as firm
fixed-price and the remainder were cost-sharing. 

The
Company s contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the timing differences between cash received from a customer in connection
with contractual rights to invoicing and the timing of revenue recognition following completion of performance obligations. The Company s
accounts receivable balance is made up entirely of customer contract-related balances. 

The
Company s revenue also includes revenue from certain contracts which do not fall within the scope of ASC 606, but under the scope
of ASC 842, Leases . At inception of a contract for those classified under ASC 842, the Company classifies leases as either operating or financing
in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance contained within ASC Topic 842. If the direct financing
or sales-type classification criteria are met, then the lease is accounted for as a finance lease. All others are treated as operating
leases. The Company recognizes revenue from operating lease arrangements generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term, or as
agreed upon in-use days are utilized, which is presented in Revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company also enters
into lease arrangements for its PowerBuoys and Wave Adaptive Modular Vessels WAM-V with certain customers.
Revenue related to multiple-element arrangements is allocated to lease and non-lease elements based on their relative standalone selling
prices or expected cost plus a margin approach. Lease elements generally include a PowerBuoy , WAM-V , and components, while
non-lease elements, which the Company expects to become more prevalent, generally include engineering, monitoring and support services.
In the lease arrangement, the customer may be provided with an option to extend the lease term or purchase the leased buoy or WAM-V 
at some point during and/or at the end of the lease term. 

As
of October 31, 2024, the Company s total remaining performance obligations, also referred to as backlog, totaled million. 

Existing
customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors. If it is determined that collectability
of any portion of the contract value is not probable, an analysis of variable consideration will be performed using either the most likely
amount or expected value method to determine the amount of revenue that must be constrained until the scenario causing the variability
has been resolved. 

The
Company has elected to record taxes collected from customers on a net basis and does not include tax amounts in revenue or costs of revenue.

Assets 

Contract
assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from arrangements whereby the right to payment is conditional on completing additional
tasks or services for a performance obligation. The increase in contract assets from year end is primarily a result of consulting services
projects for which revenue was recognized in the current period but has not yet been billed. No impairments to contract assets were incurred
during the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023.

Information 

Right-of-use
assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term
at commencement date. When the implicit rate of the lease is not provided or cannot be determined, the Company uses the incremental borrowing
rate based on the information available at the effective date to determine the present value of future payments. Lease terms may include
options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options. The renewal options
have not been included in the lease term as they are not reasonably certain of exercise. The Company s operating leases consist
of leases for office facilities and warehouse space. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight- line basis
over the lease term and consists of interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right of use asset. 

The
Company has a lease for its facility located in Monroe Township, New Jersey that is used as warehouse/production space and the Company s
principal offices and corporate headquarters. In February 2024, the Company extended the lease for its main headquarters in Monroe, NJ
to April 30, 2026. The lease is classified as an operating
lease and is included in right-of-use assets, net, right-of-use liabilities current portion, and right-of-use liabilities- less
current portion on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The
Company also has a lease for office space located in Richmond, California. This lease commenced in April of 2023 and will continue
for 62 months and set to expire in June of 2028. The lease is classified as an operating lease and is included in right-of-use assets, right-of-use liabilities-
current and right-of-use liabilities- long-term on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Stock
Options 

The
Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award granted with service-based vesting requirements, using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model, assuming no dividends, and using weighted average valuation assumptions. The risk-free rate is based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant commensurate with the expected life of the award. The expected life
(estimated period of time outstanding) of the stock options granted was estimated using the simplified method as
permitted by the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, Share-Based Payment. Expected volatility is based on the
Company s historical volatility over the expected life of the stock option granted. The Company did not grant any stock
options during the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Litigation
with Paragon Technologies, Inc. 

On
June 16, 2023, Paragon Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is a stockholder of the Company Paragon ), informed
the Company that Paragon was planning a proxy contest against the Company and intended to nominate candidates for election to the Company
Board of Directors (the OPT Board at the Company s 2023 Annual Meeting (the 2023 Annual Meeting ).
Subsequently, Paragon disclosed its intention to replace a majority of the six-member OPT Board with initially five purported nominees,
including three members of the Paragon Board of Directors, and, thereby, seek control of the Company. In furtherance of Paragon s
threatened agenda, Paragon brought three litigation matters against the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery. 

(a) 
 (Del.
 Code 220 Complaint) On July 27, 2023, Paragon filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against
 the Company seeking to compel the inspection of certain books and records of the Company pursuant to 8 Del. Code 220. On
 January 31, 2024, the Court issued a ruling for the Company to deliver certain books and records to Paragon, and the books and
 records that were subject to the Court s final order were produced to Paragon on April 8, 2024. No additional activity has
 occurred and the case is now closed. 

(b) 
 (Breach
 of Fiduciary Duties Complaint) On October 10, 2023, Paragon filed an additional complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State
 of Delaware against the Company, and the members of its Board of Directors, claiming certain breaches of their fiduciary duties. The
 complaint sought only injunctive relief against the Company, and not monetary damages, and therefore the financial exposure derived
 therein was limited to applicable legal fees and costs at that stage, which was material to FY 24. On November 2, 2023,
 Paragon sought leave to amend its complaint to add additional claims. The Court granted this motion for leave to amend, provided
 that the Court would not delay the hearing on the matters raised in the initial complaint, which was set for November 28, 2023. This
 hearing on the initial complaint was held and on November 30, 2023, the Court ruled in favor of the Company and denied
 Paragon s motion for injunctive relief. The status of the in the amended complaint is still pending. On February 28, 2024, the
 Company successfully finalized its 2023 annual meeting of stockholders in spite of Paragon s repeated attempts to contest the
 meeting. In an August 12, 2024 Press Release and its Form 10-Q report for the second quarter of 2024, Paragon announced that it was
 no longer pursuing litigation against the Company. 

(Del.
 Code 225 Complaint) On April 11, 2024, Paragon filed an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company, and
 the members of its Board of Directors, challenging the results of the 2023 Annual Meeting (concluded on February 28, 2024), alleging
 that a quorum was not present for the meeting. On May 7, 2024, the Company filed its answer, including that the Final Report of the
 Inspector of Election (which Paragon selected) confirmed that a quorum was present. On June 20, 2024, Paragon filed a Motion to Dismiss
 the case without prejudice. On September 19, 2024, the Court granted Paragon s request, and the case is now dismissed. 

General
Legal Matters 

From
time to time, the Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. The Company records a liability
in its consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably
estimated. The Company reviews these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision
when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in a liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company
estimates and discloses the possible loss or range of loss to the extent necessary to make the consolidated financial statements not
misleading. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in its consolidated financial
statements. 

or more of the outstanding common stock without approval by potentially subjecting any such person
or group to significant dilution. The Plan was approved by shareholders by a non-binding advisory vote at the Company s Annual
Meeting held on February 28, 2024. 

The
Company determined the grant date fair value of the Rights using an option-pricing model. The amount was immaterial to the consolidated
financial statements and deemed to be de minimis, and accordingly was not recorded to the financial statements. 

Sale
of New Jersey NOL s and R D Tax Credits 

In
order to monetize their attributes, the Company has historically sold the Net Operating Losses (NOL s) and R D credit generated
in New Jersey. In September 2024 the Company was notified that it received a preliminary award of approximately 
 million for, New Jersey State for the sale of
the fiscal year 2024 NOL. The final allocation is expected to be determined during the fourth quarter of OPT s 2025 fiscal year
when the sale of the NOL s and credit are finalized. The Company has elected to recognize the gain on the sale as a component of
tax expense at the time of the sale. Historically the Company has received over 90 of the amount of the preliminary award upon final
sale. 

reportable segment as the revenues associated
with its different business lines are not material enough to justify segment reporting or to make it meaningful to investors, and the
Company s chief operating decision maker does not view the Company s operations on a segment basis. The Company operates
worldwide, with its U.S. operations in New Jersey and California and one operating subsidiary in the UK. Revenues and expenses are generally
attributed to the operating unit that bills the customers. During each of the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the
Company s primary business operations were in North America, South America and EMEA.

and cost-effective data collection, analysis, transportation and communication. Our solutions are primarily suited to ocean and other
offshore environments, and support generation of actionable intelligence on a standalone basis or working with other data sources. We
channel the information we collect, and other communications, through control equipment linked to edge computing and cloud hosting environments.
The data collected by OPT s technologies underscores the Company s unique position as a system of systems provider. What
sets OPT apart is its ability to enhance these data collection capabilities by integrating the WAM-V and PB systems. This integration
enables the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning not only to improve data accuracy and operational efficiency but also
delivery of persistent actionable intelligence over greater distances 

We
were incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in April 1984 and began commercial operations in 1994. On April 23, 2007,
we reincorporated in Delaware. 

Our
Solutions 

Data
as a Service 

Our
DaaS solution is at the forefront of our strategic goal to be a leader in offshore data collection, integration, analytics and real time
communication for a variety of important applications. For example, our solutions can track surface vessel movement for maritime border
enforcement and illegal fishing interdiction, provide security for offshore wind farms and oil and gas fields, and provide harbor or
port security as well as logistics support. We have the ability to support aquaculture and gather information on ocean currents, water
quality, wind and other weather metrics, provide photography, and map shorelines or subsurface bathymetry, objects and activity frequently
required for obtaining development and operational permits with environmental studies. We also offer 24/7 monitoring solutions that can
provide meaningful real time information, and long-term data collection and analytics for sophisticated applications across many industries
and scientific applications. Additionally, the stability of our WAM-V platform makes it an ideal solution to produce high quality
sonar data in many sea conditions for subsea surveys. WAM-V s can also be outfitted with various equipment for the performance
of marine infrastructure surveys, berth clearance surveys, dredging surveys, and mining pit surveys.

In
February 2024, the Company received additional funding from the Naval Postgraduate School for the year-long deployment of a PowerBuoy 
in Monterey Bay. The PowerBuoy , integrating our MDAS along with cutting-edge Satellite communication and AT T 5G technology,
will demonstrate its persistent surveillance and communications capacities in a maritime environment. This deployment marks a significant
milestone in maritime technology, showcasing the potential of standalone at-sea infrastructure nodes to support diverse operational needs.
We have further expanded our DaaS offering through field demonstration such as ANTX Coastal Trident, as well as the Naval Task Force
59 for the Digital Horizon field exercise and the International Maritime Exercise (IMX) in Bahrain. Additional DaaS contracts include
Sulmara for survey services with our WAM-V platform and Phase I funding through National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s
(NOAA) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. 

In
September 2023, the Company received an award of three separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple-Award Contracts
(MAC) from the NOAA. NOAA has selected OPT as one of several Multiple Award IDIQ contract holders to provide Uncrewed Maritime Systems
(UMS) Services to NOAA s Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO), Uncrewed Systems Operation Center (UxSOC). Under these
contracts, OPT will bring its expertise to utilize cutting-edge UMS to support NOAA in conducting vital marine resource surveys and research
while also playing a pivotal role in enhancing NOAA s meteorological and oceanographic observations, further advancing our understanding
of the natural world. Finally, OPT will collaborate with NOAA to explore and characterize the depths of our oceans, contributing to the
discovery and preservation of invaluable marine ecosystems. 

Additionally,
the Company was awarded a contract to provide scientific hardware delivery, training, and integration services under a subcontract for
a U.S. government agency. This project seeks to identify and integrate sensors and systems and share data suitable for the full spectrum
of maritime operations. We will provide the required hardware, hardware deployment support, software, software deployment support, integration
services, surveillance and telemetry data, and associated training in support of a legacy PB3 PowerBuoy equipped with our Maritime
Domain Awareness (MDA) solution. The project will be deployed in support of security efforts to detect illegal, unreported, and unregulated IUU fishing, dark vessels, and human/drug trafficking in operation 24/7/365. As further discussed under Commercial
Activities, the Company was awarded a contract in support of foreign law enforcement partners. This collaboration aims to protect
vital marine species and combat illegal, unreported, and IUU fishing activities in critical habitats using our state-of-the-art uncrewed
technologies and demonstrates unprecedented, networked surveillance capabilities and evidence collection. 

Maritime
Domain Awareness Solution MDAS 

The
International Maritime Organization defines Maritime Domain Awareness as the effective understanding of any activity that could impact
the security, safety, economy, or environment related to and within our oceans and seas. Since 2002, the U.S. has had an active strategy
to secure the maritime domain, primarily through the U.S. Navy. Furthermore, the U.S. Coast Guard has elevated IUU fishing, one aspect
of MDA security, as a leading global maritime threat. 

We
have designed our solution to provide detailed, localized maritime domain awareness that can be utilized for a wide range of applications
across market segments. Our MDAS base hardware consists of a high-definition radar, a stabilized high-definition optical and thermal
imaging camera, and a vessel Automatic Identification System AIS detection module. This hardware can be customized or
supplemented by other solutions, depending on the requirements of our customers. These devices can be mounted on our products, such as
our legacy PB3 and NextGen PB or WAM-V , and then, utilizing integrated command and control software, data would be sent to us and
to our customers via secure communications channels. Multiple sensors can be used on a single unit based on the comprehensiveness of
the needs of our customers.

 Table of Contents 

Our
MDAS processes data onboard our platforms (i.e., edge computing) and transmits the results to our cloud-based analytics platform via
secure Wi-Fi and cellular and satellite communications. We anticipate integrating our MDAS solution into our WAM-V s to add
mobile assets for patrols or interdiction and utilizing satellite communication to expand the availability of our data service. Surveillance
data can be integrated with third party marine monitoring software or with our own MDAS software solution to provide command and control
features of a multi-platform surveillance network. As an example, one or more WAM-Vs can be networked to our self-powered buoy,
which acts as a central data and communication hub. These WAM-Vs can significantly increase the range of our MDAS network solutions.
The data can also be integrated with satellite, weather, bathymetric, and other third-party data feeds to form a detailed surface and
subsea picture of a monitored area. All vessel video, radar, and track data can be securely stored in our cloud, or the customer s
cloud environment and is accessible for as long as required by the customer for further analysis and reference. We refer to the integrated
Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance systems as Merrows. 

The
Company launched the first commercially ready MDAS on a test buoy off the coast of New Jersey in September 2021. The system includes
our proprietary integration of sensors, hardware and software, supported by cloud infrastructure as well as having a web-based user interface
that displays camera, radar, AIS and live chart data. During the first half of calendar 2024 we successfully demonstrated the system
multiple times for potential customers, including a remote demonstrations using assets deployed off New Jersey for potential customers
active in the Mediterranean, South America and Middle East. 

Autonomous
Vehicles WAM-V 

Our
Autonomous Vehicles business incorporates the patented WAM-V technology, which enables roaming capabilities for unmanned maritime
systems in waters around the world. The first WAM-V was launched in 2007 as a new vehicle class to deliver reliable autonomous surface
vehicles to customers that could provide robust, real-time data collection and reporting. Our Autonomous Vehicles business also provides
RaaS, allowing customers to lease WAM-V robotics and access information from our WAM-Vs while we maintain ownership and maintenance
and repair responsibilities. Today, WAM-Vs operate in ten countries for commercial, military defense and scientific uses. Our WAM-Vs 
exist in three primary sizes of 8, 16, and 22 feet. However, many of the design components are common across the sizes, allowing for
integration of different payloads and adaptation of the payload platforms for larger equipment. All sizes can be adapted to suit electric
or liquid fuel propulsion methods. 

The
WAM-V product line highly complements the Company s business strategy and can be used inshore, nearshore, and offshore. This
business continues to grow and is further expanding into core marine survey and maritime security markets in the Middle East, Europe,
Asia, Oceania and the Americas. We continue to find ways to integrate Autonomous Vehicles with the Company s existing platforms
and service offerings and expect to take advantage of new synergistic opportunities as they arise. In addition, in connection with our
Merrows offering noted below, we are already integrating data streams relating to all aspects of, on, under, adjacent to, or bordering
on a sea, ocean, or other navigable waterway onto the WAM-V to expand our offering to provide a roaming MDA solution to our customers.

Recent
Technological Advancements 

In
October 2024 we completed the second set of exercises of the previously announced follow-on contract as a subcontractor to EpiSci and
successfully deployed several WAM-V autonomous surface vehicles during the Mission Autonomy Proving Grounds (MAPG) as part of Project
Overmatch. Project Overmatch is a United States Navy initiative aimed at achieving a seamless and highly integrated warfighting capability
by leveraging advanced data networks, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. Under this contract, OPT continues to ruggedize
and enhance the operational capability of its autonomous maritime technologies to support the U.S. military and its allies. The first
set of exercises was concluded over the summer and the completion of these most recent exercises contributed to the revenue recognition
noted above. 

In
September 2024, we announced that we completed more than four months of offshore testing of our Next Generation PowerBuoy PB in the Atlantic Ocean off New Jersey. The solar and wind power equipped Next Generation PB was equipped with OPT s
AI capable Merrows suite of solutions. The system maintained 100 data uptime and the state of charge of the batteries remained
over 90 throughout the deployment. During the deployment, several intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance demonstrations for
potential customers were completed. 

In
April 2024, the Company announced Merrows, a projected significant step forward to enhance maritime domain awareness and underline the
critical importance of ocean security s role in national security. Merrows is OPT s consolidated solution offering comprehensive
ocean surveillance and involves the deployment of sophisticated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance,
and Reconnaissance systems. These systems are integrated within OPT s roaming technologies, such as the WAM-V, and geostationary technologies,
like the PB, to offer an unparalleled level of surveillance and data analysis capability. This initiative, which builds on OPT s
recently completed R D efforts, demonstrates OPT s commitment to safeguarding the world s oceans through advanced technology
and innovation. 

In
May 2024, the Company announced it was approaching 15MWh of renewable energy production from its family of PBs. The recent launch of its
Next Generation PB off the coast of New Jersey has materially accelerated average energy production by combining solar, wind, and wave
energy production capabilities. The energy generation numbers are based on deployments in the Atlantic, Pacific, Mediterranean, and North
Sea. OPT has demonstrated and delivered use cases as a proven solution for Anti-Submarine Warfare, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance,
USV Charging, and Environmental Sensing. These numbers show that non-grid connected marine energy production is not just for the R D
community but is a commercially available solution. 

Robotics
as a Service RaaS 

During
fiscal 2023 the Company introduced the subscription model for our customers to access our WAM-V s . Under this model we lease
our WAM-V s to our customers over a fixed time period or provide a specified number of use days, typically with a guaranteed minimum.
This model provides a lower cost entry point for our customers to access our products, provides a try before buying opportunity, and
allows our customers increased access during periods of increased need. The Company expects to benefit from the growing RaaS trend, providing
greater visibility into predicting revenue and planning supply for demand, while providing our customers with flexibility and a lower
cost of entry. 

Power
as a Service PaaS 

PaaS
solutions deliver value to customers by utilizing our managed power platforms. We continue to commercialize our proprietary power
platforms that generate electricity primarily by harnessing the renewable energy of ocean waves. In addition to offering our
commercial legacy PB3, we have added solar power options to our next generation PowerBuoy (the NextGen PB and
have the option of adding small wind turbines to supplement power generation. The NextGen PB includes versions with and without a
wave energy converter (WEC), with the non-WEC version replacing our previous hybrid PB. Our focus for these solutions is on bringing
autonomous clean power to our customers wherever it is required. Moreover, offshore data and communications networks require power
to function, and our solution provides this power continuously without requiring ongoing battery replacement or older technologies
such as shore station power cables. Many of the lessons learned from the deployments of both our legacy PB3 and demonstrator systems
have been used to develop the next generation of PowerBuoy . The NextGen PBs are designed to be modular for both WEC and
non-WEC applications. The legacy PB3 will continue to be available and supported in addition to the NextGen PB, which was fully
commercialized during fiscal 2024.

Next
Generation PowerBuoy NextGen PB 

The
NextGen PB is our future platform that integrates the lessons learned from the legacy PB3 and our demonstrator systems. It consists
of two versions, one utilizing solar and wind power and one utilizing solar and wind power plus wave energy conversion capability,
to provide reliable power in remote offshore locations, regardless of ocean wave conditions. Both versions utilize the same spar
shape, thus increasing modularity and decreasing part count and costs. The WEC technology in the NextGen PB is based on our Mass on
Spring Wave Energy Converter (MOSWEC) development which has the advantages of smaller size, lower cost, sealed to the environment
design, and increased energy generation capability. The solar and wind PowerBuoy is now commercially available and the
prototype of the MOSWEC PowerBuoys has been tested off the coast of New Jersey and the solar and wind system was
used during the MDAS demonstration for ANTX during fiscal 2023. 

We
believe this product addresses a broader spectrum of customer deployment needs, including low-wave and nearshore environments, with
the potential for greater product integration within each customer project. The NextGen PB is intended to provide a stable energy
platform for our MDAS solution, and for agile deployment of other intelligence gathering surface and subsea sensors, subsea power
and surface communications applications, for electric remotely operated vehicles eROV and autonomous underwater vehicles used for mine counter measures, unexploded ordinance disposal, subsea
acoustic monitoring, underwater inspections and short-term maintenance, and subsea equipment monitoring and control. The design has
a high payload capacity for surveillance and communications equipment, including subsea acoustics, with the capability of being
tethered to subsea payloads such as batteries, or with a conventional anchor mooring system. Energy is stored in onboard lithium-ion
batteries which can power subsea and topside payloads. The control system uses sensors and an onboard computer to continuously
monitor the subsystems. The NextGen PB is designed to be able to operate over a broad range of temperature and ocean wave
conditions. It has a 50kW-hour battery system which can be expanded up to 100 kW-hour energy. 

Legacy
PB3 PowerBuoy 

The
legacy PB3 uses proprietary technologies that convert the hydrokinetic energy of ocean waves into electricity. The legacy PB3 generates
a nominal nameplate capacity rating of up to three kilowatts kW of peak power. Our Energy Storage System ESS has a capacity of up to a nominal 150 kW-hours to meet specific application requirements. 

The
legacy PB3 is designed to generate power for use independent of the power grid in offshore locations. As ocean waves pass the legacy
PB3, the rising and falling of the waves are converted into mechanical energy, which in turn, drives the electric generator. The power
electronics system then conditions the electrical output which is stored within the ESS. 

The
operation of the legacy PB3 is controlled by our customized, proprietary control system. The control system uses sensors and an onboard
computer to continuously monitor the legacy PB3 subsystems. We believe that this ability to optimize and manage the electric power output
of the legacy PB3 is a significant advantage of our technology.

Strategic
Consulting Services 

In
November 2023 OPT divested its non-core strategic consulting team so that it can more fully focus its efforts and resources on the commercialization
of its cutting-edge pipeline of products particularly for the national security and defense markets. Going forward, the focus
of our Strategic Consulting Services will be on delivering value to our customers through services which can be integrated in support
of our broader PaaS, DaaS and/or RaaS solutions. 

Strategy
and Marketing 

Our
strategy includes developing integrated solutions and services, including autonomous and cloud-based delivery systems for ocean intelligence,
ocean data and predictive analytics to provide actionable intelligence including our product offering Merrows. We also have a number
of resellers and strategic alliances, including partnerships recently entered into in the Middle East and U.S., to advance our product
and services and gain further adoption from our target markets. Our marketing efforts are focused on offshore locations that require
a cost-efficient solution for renewable, reliable, and persistent power, data collection, and communications, either by supplying electric
power to payloads that are integrated directly with our products or located in its vicinity, such as on the surface, the seabed, or in
the water column. Our recent projects have been primarily focused on military and government applications. 

Our
recent market analysis reveals evolving dynamics within the offshore MDA sector, notably influenced by the technological revolution that
enhances MDA capabilities through advanced, low-cost unmanned systems. This shift, highlighted by the National Plan to achieve MDA by
the Department of Homeland Security DHS and the Government Accountability Office GAO in their 2022 Unmanned
Maritime Systems report on Maritime Security, is further exemplified by the U.S. Coast Guard s March 2023 Unmanned System
Strategic Plan. This plan outlines a vision to effectively employ, defend against, and regulate unmanned systems in maritime operations,
underscoring the strategic importance of collaborative international efforts in maritime security. The U.S. is actively encouraging Pacific
allies to bolster their maritime surveillance capabilities to counteract regional coercive behaviors, reflecting a broader trend towards
democratizing technology to enhance global maritime safety, security, and prosperity. This aligns with our company s positioning,
as our products are well-suited to enable the Coast Guard and other maritime bodies to achieve their mission-critical capabilities in
surveillance, detection, classification, identification, and prosecution, which are essential for executing statutory missions. Moreover,
large defense contractors increasing interest in the ocean data collection space, through acquisition of small and
mid-size unmanned and autonomous surface vehicle companies, signifies a growing market and application opportunities for our unmanned
system offerings. Within the United States, our MDAS deployed on NextGen PB can also be deployed domestically, enhancing our market size. 

Unmanned
systems are increasingly in demand by defense and security and commercial companies to reduce costs and improve safety in offshore operations.
Also, geopolitical developments such as conflict in the Middle East and Eastern Europe demonstrate the need for countries to protect
their borders. In addition, the need to protect exclusive economic zones from illegal fishing activities and protect natural resources
on the seabed are accelerating the adoption of solutions or technologies that collect, transmit, and synthesize data to provide actionable
intelligence and decision-advantage to clients. Our recent operations in Bahrain and in the Asia Pacific region show the broadening geographic
opportunity for our services, especially in the defense and security markets. This includes support for other unmanned technologies, such as
aerial drones, deployment of underwater vehicles, that can then communicate via PowerBuoy deployed secure communication links. 

We
are focused on serving defense and security organizations, while also targeting offshore wind, science and research, and ports and harbors.
Our pipeline continues to grow and comprises primarily participants in defense and security markets. In addition, we continue to see
a growing number of commercial opportunities from offshore wind companies for autonomous monitoring, surveillance
and survey-related services during various stages of the project development cycle, including initial permitting that can reduce risk
in permit obtainment and legal challenge. Further, we are attracting interest targeted toward subsea applications, using proprietary
sensor payloads for environmental monitoring and subsea intelligence. We believe that our buoys and WAM-Vs are uniquely able to
deliver these services either as a standalone solutions, together or in combination with other systems. Furthermore, we are becoming a trusted provider
of solutions for the hydrography survey market, especially for shallow water operations.

Commercial
Activities 

As
noted above, we are now primarily focused on commercial activities. We have built a suite of products that we believe will be the basis
for our current and future commercial success resulting in meaningful progress in orders, pipeline, and backlog. We continue to seek
new strategic relationships and further develop our existing partnerships. We collaborate with companies that have developed or are developing
in-ocean applications requiring a persistent source of power that is also capable of real time data collection, processing and communication,
to address potential customer needs. For the three-month periods ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had two and four customers,
respectively, whose revenue accounted for at least 10 of the Company s consolidated revenue, respectively. These revenues accounted
for approximately 84 and 73 of the Company s total revenue for the respective periods. 

In
order to achieve success in ongoing commercialization efforts, we must expand our customer base and obtain commercial contracts to lease
or sell our solutions and services to customers. Our potential customer base for our solutions includes various public and private entities,
and agencies that require remote offshore power.

Business
Relationships 

We
believe that our solutions are best developed, sold, deployed, and maintained together with subject matter experts in their respective
fields. This enables the Company to protect, maintain, and evolve our various platforms and integrate them with surface and subsea payloads.
The Company has previously entered into business relationships focused on including, but not limited to, deployment and installations,
sourcing of surface payloads, and integration with autonomous vehicles. To augment our own internal software development team and further
develop the MDAS, we maintain ongoing strategic software and robotics partnerships with software companies. We believe the business relationships
with these software companies will further the development, alongside our internal technology resources, of our next-generation MDAS
product for the maritime industrial market and governmental defense and security organizations. 

We
are currently transitioning our focus from our third-party software company to our internal software team, allowing us to have faster
response to customer needs and more significant control over our MDAS solution. In addition, our internal software team will be supporting
a more integrated solution between the PB and WAM-V products, moving the Merrows initiative forward. The platform will continue to have
a flexible architecture that allows the Company to integrate new sensor technologies and third-party analytics capabilities and share
MDAS data with customers and partners. We also keep in contact with several offshore specialists and marine operations partners globally
to support our deployment, maintenance, and recovery operations and projects.

Business
Strategy 

During
the first six months of fiscal 2024, we have continued to advance our marketing programs, products, and solutions (including Merrows
noted above). We intend to build
on these efforts by introducing additional processes and making investments in appropriate human capital, operations, and manufacturing
capabilities. In support of our focus on the national security and defense markets, we have developed a defense specific sales team,
including veterans from the U.S. Navy and Swedish Navy. 

The
majority of the Company s potential customers are in areas of defense and security, hydrographic survey, offshore wind, offshore
and coastal communication networks, and MDA, including mitigation of IUU fishing, where the end use may be both domestic and abroad. 

Historically,
demonstration projects have been a requisite step towards broad solution deployment and revenue associated with specific
applications such as our New Jersey MDAS test array as part of our DaaS solution and to highlight these capabilities. Customers may
want their own dedicated demonstration depending on customer needs. During a typical demonstration project s specification,
negotiation and evaluation period, we are often subject to the prospective customer s vendor qualification process, which
entails substantial due diligence of the Company and its capabilities. Such demonstrations are often a required step prior to
leasing and may include negotiation of standard terms and conditions. Many proposals contain provisions which would provide the
option to purchase or lease our PowerBuoy or WAM-V product upon successful conclusion of the demonstration project. The
Company maintains access to WAM-Vs assets for demonstrations and has successfully demonstrated the capabilities of many of
its solutions on its own or in customer-sponsored evaluation projects and remains focused on further demonstrations to build
customer awareness and confidence in our products and services and ultimately to drive revenue. 

The
Company is pursuing a long-term growth strategy to expand its market value proposition while growing the Company s revenue base.
This strategy includes partnerships with leading companies and organizations in adjacent and complementary markets. We continue to refine
NextGen PB and WAM-V products for use in offshore power, data acquisition, and real-time data communications applications, and to
achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following business objectives: 

Provide
 integrated turn-key solutions, purchases or leases. We believe our DaaS, RaaS and PaaS solutions, together with our platforms, are
 well suited to enable unmanned, autonomous (non-grid connected) offshore applications, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
 (ISR), mine counter measure operations, topside and subsea surveillance and communications, surveying, subsea equipment monitoring,
 early warning systems platform, subsea power and buffering, and weather and climate data collection. We have investigated and realized
 market demand for some of these solutions, and we intend to sell and/or lease our products to these markets as part of these broader
 integrated solutions. Additionally, we intend to provide services associated with our solution offerings such as paid engineering
 studies, value-added engineering, maintenance, remote monitoring and diagnostics, application engineering, planning, training, project
 management, and marine and logistics support required for our solution life cycle. As our MDAS development continues, we expect that
 this will also include data and cloud services, as well as Counter Unmanned Underwater Vehicle CUUV WAM-V capability.
 CUUV represents emerging technologies designed to detect, track, and neutralize unmanned underwater vehicles and is an important
 area of growth in ensuring maritime security. Recent demonstrations successfully showcased the ability to detect multiple underwater
 threats, including singular and swarming micro AUV. 

Expand
 customer system solution offerings through new complementary products that enable more cost-efficient deployments that make shorter
 missions more feasible. We are continuously innovating new solutions to deliver enhanced value to our customers, such as enhancing
 our MDAS and improving our deployment platforms solutions, such as our PowerBuoys and WAM-Vs . We have substantially completed
 development of our next generation PowerBuoy that incorporates wave, wind, and solar power generation capabilities in
 a robust yet cost effective system that supports shorter term missions as well as the ability to operate in near shore and low wave
 environments. This effort was partially funded by the DOE SBIR Phase II award. In addition, we have integrated PowerBuoy and
 WAM-V capabilities, including WAM-V recharging from a PowerBuoy , with future plans to integrate MDAS capabilities
 into our WAM-Vs , thus extending our reach and providing both fixed and mobile MDAS offerings to our customers. 

Focus
 WAM-Vs on the defense and security, hydrographic survey, and surveillance industries. We are well positioned to capitalize on
 the growing demand for unmanned surface vehicles to provide maritime safety, security, and awareness of what is happening in the
 maritime domain, including surveillance, detection, classification, and identification. The ability of our WAM-Vs to handle
 various payloads allows us to target navigation surveys, marine infrastructure surveys, berth clearance surveys, dredging surveys,
 and mining pit surveys. Near-term future markets for our WAM-Vs include the use of WAM-Vs for the launch of aerial drones
 and underwater survey equipment. WAM-Vs are easily and economically shipped via land, air, or sea, and their modular design
 enables us to quickly reduce their size for storage or shipment. The ability to disassemble a WAM-V reduces the footprint by
 as much as 75 , and as a result, a 20-foot container can hold four 16-foot WAM-Vs . In addition, our 8-foot WAM-V can be
 checked as baggage on a standard commercial flight. To integrate our solutions and add roaming as an option or enhancement to our
 MDAS, we are advancing developments to further integrate MDAS into the WAM-V platform and develop additional autonomy capabilities.

Focus
 sales efforts on key global markets in the U.S., Middle East, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa. While we are marketing our products
 and services globally, we have focused on several key markets and applications, including U.S. and foreign defense and security applications
 with our MDAS offering; and the hydrographic survey market with regard to our WAM-Vs . We believe that each of these areas has
 demand for our solutions, sizable end market opportunities, and high levels of industrialization and economic development. Our headquarters
 in Monroe Township, New Jersey and our office in Richmond, California enable us to support the geographic diversity of our customers
 and strengthen our dialogue with our solution partners located on both the east and west coasts of the U.S. 

Expand
 our relationships in key market areas through strategic partnerships and collaborations. We believe that strategic partners are an
 important part of expanding visibility to our products. Partnerships and collaborations can be used to improve the development of
 overall integrated solutions, create new market channels, expand commercial know-how and geographic footprint, and bolster our product
 delivery capabilities. We have formed such a relationship with several well-known groups, and we continue to seek other opportunities
 to collaborate with application experts from within our selected markets. These partnerships have helped us source services, such
 as installation expertise, and products, such as MDA enabling equipment, to meet our development and customer obligations. We have
 been actively pursuing additional opportunities to bring in-house skills, capabilities, and solutions that are complementary to our
 strategy and enable us to scale more quickly. 

Partner
 with fabrication, deployment and service contractors. In order to minimize our capital requirements as we scale our business, we
 intend to optimize and utilize state of the art fabrication, anchoring, mooring, cabling supply, and in some cases, deployment of
 our products and solutions. We believe this domestically distributed manufacturing and assembly approach enables us to focus on our
 core competencies and ensure a cost-effective product by leveraging a larger more established supply base. We continue to seek strategic
 partnerships regarding servicing of our products and solutions. 

Expand
 survey and security market applications. Through our WAM-V products, we can increase our ability to lease vehicles specifically
 to support shoreline and offshore survey markets as well as security applications while integrating MDA into these solutions. 

Liquidity 

During
the six months ended October 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately 8.4 million and used cash in operations of approximately
 10.9 million. In addition, the Company has continued to make investments to build inventory, support order backlog and future growth. 

The
Company s future results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Company s
future operating results and could cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, performance

of new products and solutions, engage in corporate development and merger and acquisition activities, for working capital needs, capital
expenditures, repayment or refinancing of indebtedness, repurchases and redemptions of securities, and for other general corporate purposes. 

The
Company s current cash balance may not be sufficient to fund its planned expenditures through December 2025. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the Company s operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities
arising from normal business operations when they become due. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on
a basis which assumes the Company is a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from any uncertainty related
to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material.

of October 31, 2024, the Company s backlog was 3.8 million. Our backlog includes unfilled firm orders for our products and services
from commercial or governmental customers. If any of our contracts were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected
value of the remaining terms of such contract. 

The
amount of contract backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenue because modifications to or terminations of present contracts
and production delays can provide additional revenue or reduce anticipated revenue. A portion of our revenue is recognized using the
input method used to measure progress towards completion of our customer contracts over time, and changes in estimates from time to time
may have a significant effect on revenue and backlog. Our backlog is subject to large variations from time to time due
to the timing of new awards. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

To
understand our financial statements, it is important to understand our critical accounting policies and estimates. We prepare our financial
statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements
also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses and related
disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are differences
between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows will be affected. We believe that accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance,
as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates. 

We
believe the following accounting policy requires significant judgment and estimates by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements. 

For
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see the section entitled Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024. There were
no material changes to our critical accounting estimates or accounting policies during the three and six months ended October 31, 2024. 

Revenue
recognition 

The
Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 (ASC 606) for contracts with customers and Accounting
Standards Codification 842 (ASC 842) for leasing arrangements. In relation to ASC 606, which states that a performance obligation is
the unit of account for revenue recognition, the Company assesses the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer and identifies
as a performance obligation as either: a) a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct; or b) a series of distinct
goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. A contract may contain
a single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company
allocates the contracted transaction price to each performance obligation based upon the relative standalone selling price, which represents
the price the Company would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The Company determines the standalone selling price
based upon the facts and circumstances of each obligated good or service. When no observable standalone selling price is available, the
standalone selling price is generally estimated based upon the Company s forecast of the total cost to satisfy the performance
obligation plus an appropriate profit margin.

 Table of Contents 

The
nature of the Company s contracts may give rise to several types of variable consideration, including unpriced change orders, liquidated
damages and penalties. Variable consideration can also arise from modifications to the scope of services. Variable consideration is included
in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur once
the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of
whether to include such amounts in the transaction price are based largely on our assessment of legal enforceability, performance, and
any other information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. There was no variable consideration as
of October 31, 2024 or 2023. The Company presents shipping and handling costs, that occur after control of the promised goods or services
transfer to the customer, as fulfillment costs in costs of goods sold and regular shipping and handling activities charged to operating
expenses. 

The
Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a good or service to a customer, either (1)
at a point in time or (2) over time. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control. The evaluation of whether
control of each performance obligation is transferred at a point in time or over time is made at contract inception. Input measures such
as costs incurred are utilized to assess progress against specific contractual performance obligations for the Company s services.
The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the services to be
provided. For the Company, the input method using costs or labor hours incurred best represents the measure of progress against the performance
obligations incorporated within the contractual agreements. If estimated total costs on any contract project a loss, the Company charges
the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss becomes known. The cumulative effect of revisions to revenue, estimated
costs to complete contracts, including penalties, change orders, claims, anticipated losses, and others are recorded in the accounting
period in which the events indicating a loss are known and the loss can be reasonably estimated. These loss projections are re-assessed
for each subsequent reporting period until the project is complete. Such revisions could occur at any time and the effects may be material.
During the six-month period ended October 31, 2024, the Company recognized approximately 3.6 million in revenue related to performance
obligations satisfied at a point in time and approximately 0.1 million in revenue related to performance obligations satisfied over
time. During the three month period ended October 31, 2024, the Company recognized approximately 2.3 million in revenue related to performance
obligations satisfied at a point in time and approximately 0.1 million in revenue related to performance obligations satisfied over
time. 

The
Company s contracts are either cost-plus contracts, fixed-price contracts, time and material agreements, lease or service agreements.
Under cost plus contracts, customers are billed for actual expenses incurred plus an agreed-upon fee. 

The
Company has two types of fixed-price contracts, firm fixed-price and cost-sharing. Under firm fixed-price contracts, the Company receives
an agreed-upon amount for providing products and services specified in the contract, and a profit or loss is recognized depending on
whether actual costs are more or less than the agreed-upon amount. Under cost-sharing contracts, the fixed amount agreed upon with the
customer is only intended to fund a portion of the costs on a specific project. Under cost sharing contracts, an amount corresponding
to the revenue is recorded in cost of revenue, resulting in gross profit on these contracts of zero. The Company s share of the
costs is recorded as product development expense. The Company reports its disaggregation of revenue by contract type since this method
best represents the Company s business. For the three- and six-month period ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of the
Company s contracts were classified as firm fixed-price and the balance were cost-sharing. 

The
Company s revenue also includes revenue from certain contracts which do not fall within the scope of ASC 606, but under the scope
of ASC 842. At inception of a contract for those classified under ASC 842, the Company classifies leases as either operating or financing
in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance contained within ASC Topic 842, Leases . If the direct financing
or sales-type classification criteria are met, then the lease is accounted for as a finance lease. All others are treated as operating
leases. The Company recognizes revenue from operating lease arrangements generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term, or as
agreed upon in-use days are utilized, which is presented in Revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company also enters
into lease arrangements for its PowerBuoys and WAM-V with certain customers. Revenue related to multiple-element arrangements
is allocated to lease and non-lease elements based on their relative standalone selling prices or expected cost plus a margin approach.
Lease elements generally include a PowerBuoy , WAM-V , and components, while non-lease elements, which the Company expects to
become more prevalent, generally include engineering, monitoring and support services. In the lease arrangement, the customer may be
provided with an option to extend the lease term or purchase the leased buoy or WAM-V at some point during and/or at the end of
the lease term.

For U.S. Government contracts, the revenue is classified as North American however, location of operations may differ. 

Cost
of revenue 

Our
cost of revenue consists primarily of subcontracts, incurred material, labor and manufacturing overhead expenses, such as engineering
expense, equipment depreciation, maintenance, and facility related expenses, and includes the cost of equipment to customize the PowerBuoy ,
WAM-V and our other products supplied by third-party suppliers. Cost of revenue also includes PowerBuoy and other product system
delivery and deployment expenses and may include losses recorded at the time a loss is forecasted to be incurred on a contract. 

Operating
Expenses 

Engineering
and product development costs 

Our
engineering and product enhancement costs consist of salaries and other personnel-related costs and the costs of products, materials
and outside services used in our product enhancement and unfunded research activities. Our product enhancement costs relate primarily
to our efforts to increase the power output and reliability of our PowerBuoy system and other products, to enhance and optimize
data monitoring and controls systems, and the development of new products, product applications and complementary technologies. We expense
all of these costs as incurred. 

Selling,
general and administrative costs 

Our
selling, general and administrative costs consist primarily of professional fees, salaries, share-based compensation and other personnel-related
costs for employees and consultants engaged in sales and marketing of our products, and costs for executive, accounting and administrative
personnel, professional fees and other general corporate expenses.

Foreign
exchange gain (loss) 

We
transact business in various countries and have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Since we conduct our business
in U.S. dollars and our functional currency is the U.S. dollar, our main foreign exchange exposure, if any, results from changes in the
exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and transactions settled in foreign currencies. 

The
Company completed the process of winding down its Australian subsidiary during fiscal 2024. The Company began the process of winding
down its UK subsidiary during fiscal 2024 and expects this to be completed during fiscal 2025. The unrealized gains or losses resulting
from foreign currency balances translation are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss within Shareholders Equity. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are recognized within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

We
currently do not hedge our exchange rate exposure. However, we assess the anticipated foreign currency working capital requirements and
capital asset acquisitions of our foreign operations and assess the need and cost to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency
exposures on an ongoing basis and may hedge against exchange rate exposure in the future.

Revenues 

Revenues
for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 2.4 million and 0.9 million, respectively. The year-over-year
increase primarily reflects higher levels of revenue stemming from the sales and leases of WAM-Vs. 

Cost
of revenues 

Cost
of revenues for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 increased to 1.6 million from 0.4 million, respectively. The
year-over-year increase is related primarily to a revenue increase, partially offset by changes in product mix, with
the current year s quarterly revenue containing a larger amount of third-party equipment, and associated lower margins. 

Gain
from change in fair value of contingent consideration 

The
gain from change in fair value of contingent consideration for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 was zero and a 23,000
decrease in the liabilities value, respectively. The prior year amount was due to changes in actual and forecasted bookings relating
to the MAR acquisition. 

Operating
expenses 

Operating
expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 were 4.7 million and 8.0 million, respectively. The decrease of approximately
 3.3 million was primarily the result of the significant cost reduction activities we implemented at the end
of fiscal 2024 including headcount optimization, material reductions in third party spend, and efforts to tightly control and contain
costs. 

Interest income 

Interest
income for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 was less than 0.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively, with the decrease
primarily related to lower investment balances in the current year.

Liquidity
Outlook 

Since
our inception, the cash flows from customer revenues have not been sufficient to fund our operations and provide the capital resources
for our business. As of October 31, 2024, our year-to-date revenues were 3.7 million, our year-to-date net losses were 8.4 million,
and our year-to-date net cash used in operating activities was 10.9 million. 

We
expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand our sales, marketing and manufacturing programs associated with the
continued commercialization of our products. Our future capital requirements will depend on several factors, including but not
limited to: 

our
 ability to improve, market and commercialize our products, and achieve and sustain profitability; 

our
 continued improvement of our proprietary technologies, and expected continued use of cash from operating activities unless or until
 we achieve positive cash flow from the commercialization of our products and services; 

our
 ability to obtain additional funding, as and if needed, which will be subject to several
 factors, including market conditions, and our operating performance; 
 the
 substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern; 

our
 history of operating losses, which we expect to continue for at least the short term and possibly longer; 

our
 ability to manage challenges and expenses associated with communications and disputes with activist shareholders, including litigation; 

our
 ability to manage and mitigate risks associated with our internal cyber security protocols and protection of the data we collect
 and distribute; 

our
 ability to protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

the
 impact of inflation related to the U.S. dollar on our business, operations, customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and personnel; 

our
 ability to meet product enhancement, manufacturing and customer delivery deadlines and the potential impact due to disruptions to
 our supply chain or our ability to identify vendors that can assist with the prefabrication elements of our products, as a result
 of, among other things, staff shortages, order delays, and increased pricing from vendors and manufacturers; 

our
 forecasts and estimates regarding future expenses, revenue, and capital requirements; 

our
 ability to identify and penetrate markets for our products, services, and solutions; 

our
 ability to effectively respond to competition in our targeted markets; 

our
 ability to establish relationships with our existing and future strategic partners which may not be successful; 

our
 ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American; 

the
 reliability of our technology, products and solutions; 

our
 ability to increase or more efficiently utilize the synergies available from our product lines: 

changes
 in current legislation, regulations and economic conditions that affect the demand for, or restrict the use of our products; 

our
 ability to expand markets across geographic boundaries; 

our
 ability to be successful with Federal government work which is complex due to various statutes and regulations applicable to doing
 business with the Federal government; 

our
 ability to be successful doing business internationally which requires strict compliance with applicable import, export, ITAR, anti-bribery
 and related statutes and regulations; 

the
 current geopolitical world uncertainty, including Russia s invasion of Ukraine, the Israel/Palestine conflict and recent attacks
 on merchant ships in the Red Sea; 

our
 ability to hire and retain key personnel, including senior management, to achieve our business objectives; and 

our
 ability to establish and maintain commercial profit margins. 

Our
business is capital intensive, and through October 31, 2024, we have been funding our business principally through sales of our securities.
As of October 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and long-term restricted cash balance was 2.2 million and we expect to fund our
business with this amount and, to a lesser extent, with our cash flow generated from operations. Management believes the Company s
current cash and cash equivalents, and long-term restricted cash, may not be sufficient to fund its planned expenditures through December
2025. 

These
conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least a period
of one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
the Company s operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities
arising from normal business operations when they become due.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be
disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
a company have been detected. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant
to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective, due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that are described in our Annual Report
on form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024 (the 2024 10-K ). 

Notwithstanding
such material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our management, including our CEO and CFO, has concluded that
our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of our operations and
our cash flows for the periods presented in this Quarterly Report, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Remediation
Plans 

As
previously described in Part II Item 9A Controls and Procedures of the 2024 10-K, we continue to implement a remediation
plan to address the material weaknesses mentioned above. The weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls
operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.
Please see below for the remediation actions taken by management. 

We
trained our employees to reinforce the importance of a strong control environment and communicated expectations to emphasize responsibilities
and the technical requirements for controls, and to set the appropriate expectations on internal controls. 

We
established a business process control remediation plan, which included frequent communications between our Audit Committee and senior
management regarding the progression of remediation of our financial reporting and internal control environment 

We
are establishing IT General Controls and investing in people and technology to address gaps in IT Systems Security controls. In addition,
there is now a formal process for System and Organization Controls SOC Report reviews and templates that are being performed
by management. 

We
engaged third-party consultants to assist with process mapping and internal control design. 

Progress
has been made against management s plan to remediate these material weaknesses, but for Management to consider a material weakness
remediated, the related controls are required to function as anticipated for a minimum period which varies based upon the specified control.
As part of its remediation plan, management will put mitigating controls in place to minimize risk associated with any open material
weaknesses. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In
response to the material weaknesses described in the 2024 10-K, the Company reviewed the design of its controls and began remediation
activities to alleviate the noted control deficiencies. Other than these items, there was no change in the Company s internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended July 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Item
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

As
part of our normal business activities, we are party to a number of legal proceedings and other matters in various stages of development.
Management periodically assesses our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information
available. We disclose material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as we may determine to be appropriate. 

For
information on matters in dispute, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

Item
1A. RISK FACTORS 

The
discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024 and set forth below in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risk factors describe various
risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner. Except as noted below,
there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on
July 25, 2024. 

We
have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability and positive cash flow. 

We
have incurred net losses since we began operations in 1994, including net losses of 8.4 million during the first six months of fiscal
year 2025 and 14.3 million during the same six-month period in fiscal year 2024. As of October 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit
of 316.9 million. 

We
do not know whether we will be able to successfully commercialize our products and solutions, or whether we can achieve profitability.
There is significant uncertainty about our ability to successfully commercialize our products and solutions in our targeted markets.
Even if we do achieve commercialization of our products and solutions and become profitable, we may not be able to achieve or, if achieved,
sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. 

We
encounter seasonality and revenue variability due to the markets and customers we serve which may impact our ability to attain forecasted
revenue, earnings and cash flow targets consistently on a quarterly basis 

As
we continue to grow and scale, we anticipate some quarterly variability in both bookings and revenue recognition going forward. This
is a natural outcome of our business model, which involves securing large, complex contracts that may span multiple quarters before revenue
is fully recognized. We believe this variability will continue to be offset by our existing as a Service solutions that
provide recurring revenue, but there may be quarters in our business where this cannot be the case. Our focus remains on long-term execution,
delivering on our commitments, and driving sustained value creation. By maintaining this disciplined approach, we believe we will successfully
navigate these natural variances as we scale, but there can be no assurance that this will be the case consistently on a quarterly basis.
In turn, our ability to attain forecasted revenue, earnings and cash flow target s could be negatively impacted from time
to time.
