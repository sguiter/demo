 NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 July
31, 2024 

. The Company is in immediate need of further working capital and is seeking options, with respect
to financing, in the form of debt, equity or a combination thereof. 

Failure
to raise adequate capital and generate adequate revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations. The Company s
ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of the common stock is unknown. Additionally, even if the Company does
raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there can be no assurances that the revenue
will be sufficient to enable it to develop to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. These matters raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern; however, the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery
of the recorded assets or the classifications of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern. 

Convertible
Notes Payable and Notes Payable, in Default 

The
Company does not have additional sources of debt or equity financing to refinance or pay off its convertible notes payable that are currently
in default. If the Company is unable to obtain additional capital, such lenders may file suit, including suit to foreclose on the assets
held as collateral for the obligations arising under the secured notes. If any of the lenders file suit to foreclose on the assets held
as collateral, then the Company may be forced to significantly scale back or cease its operations which would more than likely result
in a complete loss of all capital that has been invested in or borrowed by the Company. 

The
convertible notes that have been issued by the Company are convertible at the lender s option. These convertible notes represent
significant potential dilution to the Company s current shareholders. As such when these notes are converted into equity there
is typically a highly dilutive effect on current shareholders and very high probability that such dilution may significantly negatively
affect the trading price of the Company s common stock. 

See
Note 7 Notes Payable and Convertible Notes Payable, for further information regarding the Company s convertible notes payable
and notes that are currently in default.

as of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024. 

On
August 1, 2023, the Company entered into a convertible note payable with an individual who was formerly a member of the
Company s Board of Directors until March 27, 2024. The note payable, with a face value of , bears interest at per
annum and was due on . The convertible note payable is convertible upon default, at the note holder s option,
into the Company s common shares at a fixed conversion rate of 0.01. The conversion of the note into shares of the
Company s common stock is potentially highly dilutive to current shareholders. If the note holder elects to sell the shares
that it has acquired as a result of converting the note into shares of common stock, then any such sales may result in a significant
decrease in the market price of the Company s shares. The principal balance of the convertible promissory note payable was
 50,000 at July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024. 

On February 1, 2024 the Company entered into a master
convertible corporate note agreement with Native American Price, LLC. Native American Pride, LLC advanced 63,791 to NAPC Defense, Inc.
during the year ended April 30, 2024 to cover various operating expenses. The loan balance is convertible into the shares of NAPC Defense,
Inc. at the discretion of the Native American Price, LLC at a rate of 0.03 per share. The note does not pay interest and there is no
specific time frame for repayment of the principal balance. During the three month period ended July 31, 2024 the Company repaid 61,712
of principal to Native America Pride Constructors, LLC. The balances owed on the note were 2,079 and 63,791 at July 31, 2024 and April
30, 2024, respectively. 

Short
Term Loans 

As
of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the Company had short term loans totaling . This consists of two loans totaling and
 . All loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. 

New
Convertible Notes Payable 

On
June 14, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with respect to the sale and issuance of: (i) an initial commitment
fee in the amount of 1,071,430 shares of the Company s restricted common stock, (ii) a promissory note in the aggregate principal
amount of 150,000, and (iii) Common warrants to purchase 2,678,572 shares of the Company s common stock. The company received
proceeds of 135,000 resulting in an original issue discount of 15,000. The convertible promissory note has a due date of June 14, 2025,
and bears interest at the rate of 10 per year. In the event of default as defined in the note, the outstanding balance of the note will
increase to 140 of the balance immediately prior to the occurrence of the event of default. The conversion of the note into shares of
the Company s common stock is potentially highly dilutive to current shareholders. If the note holder elects to sell the shares
that it has acquired as a result of converting the note into shares of common stock, then any such sales may result in a significant
decrease in the market price of the Company s shares. 

On
July 3, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with respect to the sale and issuance of: (i) an initial commitment
fee in the amount of 150,000 shares of the Company s restricted common stock, (ii) a promissory note in the aggregate principal
amount of 75,000, and (iii) Common warrants to purchase 2,678,572 shares of the Company s common stock. The company received proceeds
of 67,500 resulting in an original issue discount of 7,500. The convertible promissory note has a due date of July 3, 2025, and bears
interest at the rate of 10 per year. In the event of default as defined in the note, the outstanding balance of the note will increase
to 140 of the balance immediately prior to the occurrence of the event of default. The conversion of the note into shares of the Company s
common stock is potentially highly dilutive to current shareholders. The conversion of the note into shares of the Company s common
stock is potentially highly dilutive to current shareholders. If the note holder elects to sell the shares that it has acquired as a
result of converting the note into shares of common stock, then any such sales may result in a significant decrease in the market price
of the Company s shares.

and , respectively. The net change in valuation allowance during
the quarters ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 were and , respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management
has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application
of a full valuation allowance as of July 31, 2024 and 2023. All tax years since inception remains open for examination only by taxing
authorities. 

Valuation allowance 

Income tax expense 

The
Company has a net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes totaling at July 31, 2024, expiring through 2035. There is
a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than a
50 change in ownership). Temporary differences, which give rise to a net deferred tax asset, are as follows:

Description
of Business 

Overview 

NAPC
Defense, Inc. (Formerly Treasure Shipwreck Recovery, Inc (the Company ), was incorporated
in the State of Nevada on October 24, 2016 as Beliss Corp. The Company changed its name to Treasure Shipwreck Recovery Inc. on
June 26, 2019. The Company is in the colonial era treasure shipwreck recovery business operating salvage crews on the east coast of Florida.
On April 1, 2024, the Company changed its name to NAPC Defense, Inc. with the State of Nevada, for an additional direction in the military
arms and law enforcement field. 

Corporate
History 

The Company will produce and supply CornerShot units under license from Silver Shadow of Israel, to both overseas military and governments
as allowed by the US Government, and sales to US based law enforcement agencies. As well the Company intends and has direct lines of
sourcing personal ballistics protection for personnel, such as helmets, bullet resistant vests and shields for overseas sale and domestic
sale to US entities. In addition, the Company will use contacts and sources for the sale of small caliber arms in form of rifles and
pistols including newly developing technologies and products for overseas and domestic sales. Other areas of brokering existing contacts
from overseas of larger scale ammunition and artillery from overseas sources is being followed from known sources of supply for brokered
sales to US approved allies and other countries. The brokering of armored vehicles for domestic purchase and overseas sales is also being
pursued. 

Exploration
and Salvage of Historic Shipwrecks 

During
three seasons of treasure recovery operations the Company had contracted with entities for recoveries on 1715 fleet and other or ancient
wreck sites along the coast of Florida. Thus, during the 2023 search season, recoveries were made of limited quantities of artifact finds
during the treasure season. NAPC Defense, Inc. continued the pursuit of aa reality or other series during this fiscal year. 

For
the 2023 Treasure recovery season, the Company purchased a treasure recovery vessel and support vessel in March 2023. The 36 foot
vessel is outfitted with prop blowers for bottom removal, and numerous technologies for search and diving. The vessel was used for operations
in the 1715 fleet area. the Company still owns the 71 foot research vessel the Bellows which is still used for research 

For
the 2023 Summer Season the Company contracted with entities for recoveries on 1715 fleet and other or ancient wreck sites along the coast
of Florida. The value of the found artifacts and treasure will be assessed at distribution time, sometime in the fall of 2024. 

The
Company is still actively pursuing a television or other media for a reality treasure hunting show which is in negotiations presently
for development if feasible. the Company intends to own such production and rights for sale and distribution if it occurs. 

Salvage
of historic shipwrecks is both very speculative and risky as the Company worked through the last three treasure seasons off the East
Coast of Florida. The Company still maintains information and expertise on locations of treasure sites, which it is marketing to other
companies and players in the treasure business. 

During
the period of January 2024, the Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interest to explore a new business opportunity
which existed for the change in business focus to take advantage of new business opportunities in a defense related industry, while maintaining
treasure operations. The Company entered into diligence, enquiry, exploration and negotiations for acquisition and rights for defense
related technology and rights with a known party. 

19 

By
March 2024, the board determined and entered into an acquisition agreement for the acquisition of the rights, intellectual property,
and associated contracts, letters of intent, and assets from Native American Pride Constructors, LLC for acquisition of certain rights
to sale and production of the CornerShot firearms and surveillance technology, owned by Silver Shadow of Israel and licensed to Native
American Pride Constructors LLC (Native American), and other associated leads and rights into the defense industry, including munitions
brokering overseas under United Stated State Department Approval for artillery, rocket, and other munitions sales from off shore sources
to U.S. approved allies and other countries. Native American held rights to a number of ATF licenses for sale and production of arms,
was a party to a transaction for potential contract and sale of the Cornershot to Saudi Arabia and for sale in the US, and held large
access to broker munitions under US approval overseas, from foreign sourced to US Allies and approved countries. 

In
addition, other defense lines of technology development including small arms, suppressor technology development business, and other items
of opportunity held by Native American Pride Contstructors LLC, the board determined that an acquisition agreement of such rights was
in the best interest of the Company to pursue as an additional business direction while maintaining its treasure related business. Such
agreement was reached on March 26, 2024, however, was subject to further diligence and verification of the list of acquired rights and
business plans with a close out date of May 1, 2024 and sign off by NAPC Defense, Inc./BLIS by the CEO for release of the consideration
to be made for the purchase of such rights. The board concluded that the addition of this business direction was in the best interest
of the Company, regardless of the specific acquisition transaction closing. Pursuant to the March 26, 2024 agreement such acquisition
of rights was made for 95,000,000 shares of common stock to be distributed upon approval by NAPC Defense, Inc../BLIS to enumerated parties
at such time being May 1, 2024 or after. Such shares were not to be distributed to Native American upon release, so there was no change
in control to Native American. There was an acquisition of such rights, intellectual property, sales leads, letters of intent, contract
rights and leads, and other matters set forth in such agreement to gain the rights from Native American Pride and change the Company s
name to its new defense line of work to NAPC Defense, Inc. but still maintain the treasure business on a more limited basis. 

Such
shares were subject to release by the Company upon approval of the business lines, by the then current but now former CEO and Director.
Such shares did not cause a change in ownership control by any majority shareholder and have been under the rights as set forth in the
acquisition agreement. The matters of diligence to be completed for the acquisition completion were as follows: 

Items
acquired for NAPC Defense, Inc. on acquisition made, including 

CornerShot
rights for sale, domestically and through Saudi Arabia as existing with Silver Shadow of Israel, including the LOI for the CornerShot
sale for Saudi Arabia from the Ministry of Defense, which is expected, for an expected order and contract for some 37,000 units of the
CornerShot firearms and tactical units to Saudi Arabia as held by Native American Pride for the Silver Shadow of Israel, amount owed
for Saudi Arabian payment potential under a contract if transacted. Such rights include the ability to contract and utilize the ATF licenses
held for production and sale of firearms and accessories related to such technology under contract with NAPC Defense, Inc./BLIS, and
existing approvals from the Department of State for foreign arms transactions, an existing or expected approval for firearms under approval
from the Saudi Government. As well this includes the existing relationship with the Saudi Ministry of Defense for interest in the CornerShot
purchase, including the relationship and visits expected for closing of such contract. Rights to the proceeds from the joint venture
in Saudi Arabia for such introductions and potential future sales, visit to occur in Saudi Arabia, and domestic US sales potentials,
including domestic law enforcement shows, conventions and US Military demonstration. 

In addition, the ability and agreements to produce the CornerShot domestically
in the United States which includes a current plastics manufacturer relationship and metals production relationship, both to be contracted,
for such units of the CornerShot to be produced for all contracts or purchase orders which could be achieved. The Company attended various
industry and networking conventions and conferences in Florida in June 2024, in New Jersey in June 2024 and the visit to Saudi Arabia
in the summer of 2024. 

Rights
as existing to the CornerShot from Silver Shadow of Israel. To include the foreign sales to Saudi Arabia created by persons related to
Native American, as well as domestic sales to law enforcement or government agencies in the United States. To include all media, CornerShot
units, additional show and demonstration units, videos, and other rights. 

Overseas
brokering opportunities of ammunition sales to US Allies, with State Dept. the DDTC (Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, a government
agency within the United States Department of State) as a registered broker the ability to request pre-brokering approval. This includes
the sources and leads existing to large scale munitions inventories from third parties, including those on a revolving list that is held
by parties which are available overseas for sale, to approved countries and end users. This includes all contacts and relations to overseas
producers, holders, and potential purchasers of large-scale munitions sales for such areas as Allied and US military or foreign add to
Ukraine. These leads and brokering needed confirmation as to available inventories from owners overseas by the Company through relations
created with the new operations. The amounts and the available rolling catalogues of available munitions and sources were subject to
review and approval for final distribution. The verification was to be made as of or after May 1, 2024, through the former CEO with his
experience and knowledge. 

Verification
for ability to design, manufacture and sell new items and lines of firearms and accessories to include but not be limited to rifles,
small arms, ammunition, and accessories. the Company had additional information and contacts and will use the abilities of production
and sales under the Native American Pride permits to conduct such study of new technologies, firearms, production, prototyping knowledge,
and sales rights as necessary. 

20 

Thus
on April 1, 2024 there was the change in officers and directors, which was made for an additional new segment of the Company into the
defense and law enforcement business. Pursuant to the Board of Directors resolution there was no change in control of the Issuer to any
party. The change in officers and directors was made to include the following for the change in the main direction of the Company: The
Agreement was entered into without abandoning the treasure and recovery business, while the board made a change in officers and directors.
There was no change in control of the Company. 

Thus,
pursuant to the Board of Directors intent for the new addition of a business line for defense, it was decided and concluded that as of
April 1, 2024, Craig A. Huffman, Patrick Scheider, and Frederick Conte, resigned as officer and directors, with Craig A. Huffman to continue
as Secretary and Chief Legal Officer for the Corporation while overseeing and approval of the acquisition, overseeing corporate compliance,
contracting and numerous other matters on a continuing basis. The board appointed Edward K. West as Director and Chief Executive Officer,
Stephen L. Gurba as President and Director, Evelyn R. Gurba as director, Derrick West as director, and John Spence as director and Chief
Financial Officer. 

As
of April 1, 2024, the Company determined the new business priority would best be reflected by a change in the name to NAPC Defense, which
was reflected by a change of the Corporate name in the State of Nevada to NAPC Defense, Inc. 

Results
of operations 

We
have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern
and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We
will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among
other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional
capital. Based on its historical rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in less than one month from
September 23, 2024.

Liquidity
and capital resources 

As at July 31, 2024, our total assets were 3,164,231
and our total liabilities were 2,219,876. 

As at July 31, 2024, our current assets were 111,518
and current liabilities were 1,079,785. 

As of July 31, 2024 our total stockholders 
equity was 944,355. 

As of July 31, 2024 we had a working capital deficit
of 968,267. 

Cash
flows from operating activities 

For
the three months ended July 31, 2024 net cash flows used in operating activities was 163,549. 

For
the three months ended July 31, 2023 net cash flows used in operating activities was 206,722. 

Cash
flows from investing activities 

For
the three months ended July 31, 2024 net cash flow used in investing activities was 0. 

For
the three months ended July 31, 2023 net cash flow used in investing activities was 0. 

Cash
flows from financing activities 

For
the three months ended July 31, 2024 we have generated 170,288 in cash flows from financing activities. 

For
the three months ended July 31, 2023 we have generated 0 in cash flows from financing activities. 

We
qualify as a smaller reporting company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions
from certain disclosure requirements. 

For
example, smaller reporting companies are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis under Item 402(b) of Regulation
S-K or the auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting. 

Future
Financings 

We
will continue to rely on equity sales of the Company s common shares in order to continue to fund business operations. Issuances
of additional shares will result in dilution to existing shareholders. There is no assurance that the Company will achieve any additional
sales of equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned operations. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources and Cash Requirements 

As of the date of this report, the current funds available
to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining a reporting status. At July 31, 2024, the Company had a working capital
deficit of 968,267. The Company is in immediate need of further working capital and is seeking options, with respect to financing, in
the form of debt, equity or a combination thereof. Based on its historical rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available
cash in less than one month from September 23, 2024. 

The
Company may not be able to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent auditors for the years ended April 30, 2024 and
2023 raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is not able to continue as a going concern,
it is highly likely that all capital invested in the Company will be lost. 

Management
believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies pose the most significant challenge to the Company s
success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting
requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company s management will have to spend additional time on
policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement
its business plan and impede the speed of its operations. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on
the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements
that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

22 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

None 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s
Responsibility for Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s financial
reporting. The Company s controls over financial reporting are designed under the supervision of the Company s President
and Principal Financial Officer to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is accumulated and communicated to
the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, as of July 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our financial disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize and report financial information required to be included on our Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC reports due to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have
multiple levels of transaction review. However, as a result of our evaluation and review process, management believes that the financial
statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct. 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
of July 31, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and based on the criteria for effective internal control described in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (as revised). Based on our evaluation,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize
and report financial information required to be included on our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports due to
the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. However, as a result
of our evaluation and review process, management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are
materially correct. 

The
management including its Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures,
or its internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
of the control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. 

Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 

The
Company has limited resources and as a result, a material weakness in financial reporting currently exists, because of our limited resources
and personnel, including those described below. 

The
 Company has an insufficient quantity of dedicated resources and experienced personnel involved in reviewing and designing internal
 controls. As a result, a material misstatement of the interim and annual financial statements could occur and not be prevented or
 detected on a timely basis. 

We
 have not achieved the optimal level of segregation of duties relative to key financial reporting functions. 

We
 do not have an audit committee or an independent audit committee financial expert. While not being legally obligated to have an audit
 committee or independent audit committee financial expert, it is managements view that to have an audit committee, comprised of independent
 board members, and an independent audit committee financial expert is an important entity-level control over the Company s
 financial statements. 

23 

A
material weakness is a deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) auditing standard 5) or
combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management
has determined that a material weakness exists due to a lack of segregation of duties, resulting from the Company s limited resources
and personnel. 

Remediation
Efforts to Address Deficiencies in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
a result of these findings, management, upon obtaining sufficient capital and operations, intends to take practical, cost-effective steps
in implementing internal controls, including the possible remedial measures set forth below. As of July 31, 2024, we did not have sufficient
capital and/or operations to implement any of the remedial measures described below. 

Assessing
 the current duties of existing personnel and consultants, assigning additional duties to existing personnel and consultants, and,
 in a cost effective manner, potentially hiring additional personnel to assist with the preparation of the Company s financial
 statements to allow for proper segregation of duties, as well as additional resources for control documentation. 

Assessing
 the duties of the existing officers of the Company and, in a cost effective manner, possibly promote or hire additional personnel
 to diversify duties and responsibilities of such executive officers. 

Board
 to review and make recommendations to shareholders concerning the composition of the Board of Directors, with particular focus on
 issues of independence. The Board of Directors will consider nominating an audit committee and audit committee financial expert,
 which may or may not consist of independent members. 

Interviewing
 and potentially hiring outside consultants that are experts in designing internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria
 established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
 of the Treadway Commission COSO (as revised). 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

(b)
Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

The
Company has not made any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended July 31, 2024.
