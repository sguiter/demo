NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

. In
addition, the Company s net loss was for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the Company had a working capital
deficit of . As of September 30, 2024, the accumulated deficit amounted to . As a result of the Company s
history of losses and financial condition, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

 The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.
Management is evaluating different strategies to obtain financing to fund the Company s expenses and achieve a level of revenue
adequate to support the Company s current cost structure. Financing strategies may include, but are not limited to, private placements
of capital stock, debt borrowings, partnerships and/or collaborations. There can be no assurance that any of these future-funding efforts
will be successful. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. 

On
January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC No. 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies
the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with
certain exceptions. Previously, share-based payments to non-employees was accounted for in accordance with ASC No. 505, Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees, which required compensation cost to be remeasured at fair value at each reporting period when the award vests.
As a result, stock option-based payments to non-employees resulted in significant volatility in compensation expenses in prior years. 

The
Company accounts for its share-based compensation using the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. Using
this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to the (i) expected volatility of the Company s common stock
price, (ii) expected life of the award, which for options is the time over which employees and non- employees are expected to hold their
options prior to exercise, and (iii) risk-free interest rate. 

in cash, promissory notes in the
total principal amount of bearing interest per annum, and an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock
valued at , in accordance with the terms of the SPA. Additionally, the Company acquired in cash from BTA. 

As
a result of the foregoing, the Company initially recorded goodwill of . The Company conducted a valuation study upon the closing
of the acquisition of BTA. The final valuation report determined the amount goodwill to be , with the remaining of the
goodwill relating to amortizable intangibles amortized over a fifteen-year period, or approximately per year. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded in amortization expense. 

. During 2018, CoinTracking borrowed in exchange for three promissory notes (collectively,
the CoinTracking Note in the principal amounts of , , and , respectively. On December 31, 2018,
the CoinTracking Note was still outstanding. On January 2, 2019, the Company sold its equity ownership stake in CoinTracking GmbH, and
 of the sales proceeds were applied toward repayment of the outstanding loan amount under the CoinTracking Note.
The remaining balance of was outstanding as of September 30, 2022, with a due date of , which due date was extended
from the prior due date of March 31, 2021 pursuant to an amendment dated December 28, 2018. The CoinTracking Note bears interest at ,
which is payable monthly, in arrears. All payments shall be applied first to all accrued and unpaid interest and second to the outstanding
principal balance, as applicable. The maturity date of the CoinTracking Note has not been extended nor has any default been asserted
by the lender. 

Interest
expense for Notes Payable was for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to during the nine month
period ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

evaluating different strategies to obtain financing to fund our expenses and achieve a level of revenue adequate to support our current
cost structure. Financing strategies may include but are not limited to, private placements of capital stock, debt borrowings, partnerships,
and/or collaborations. There can be no assurance that any of these future-funding efforts will be successful. The consolidated financial

and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

The

that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on
various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have no material changes to our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosure
as filed in our 2023 Annual Report.
