 of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and cash flows of Marriott Vacations Worldwide, all entities in which Marriott Vacations Worldwide has a controlling voting interest subsidiaries ), and variable interest entities VIEs for which Marriott Vacations Worldwide is the primary beneficiary in accordance with consolidation accounting guidance. References in these Financial Statements to net income attributable to common stockholders and MVW stockholders equity do not include noncontrolling interests, which represent the outside ownership of our consolidated non-wholly owned entities and are reported separately. Intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 These Financial Statements reflect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as prepared in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, cost of vacation ownership products, inventory valuation, goodwill and intangibles valuation, accounting for acquired vacation ownership notes receivable, vacation ownership notes receivable reserves, income taxes, and loss contingencies. The uncertainties in the broader macroeconomic environment, including inflation, continuing high interest rates, mixed economic indicators, increased consumer debt, continuing global insecurity and political uncertainty, have made it more challenging to make these estimates. Actual results could differ from our estimates, and such differences may be material. 
 In our opinion, our Financial Statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position, the results of our operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. Interim results may not be indicative of fiscal year performance because of, among other reasons, general macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures and seasonal and short-term variations. These Financial Statements have not been audited. We have condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. Although we believe our footnote disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, the Financial Statements in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 We refer to the business and brands that we acquired in the acquisition of ILG, LLC, formerly known as ILG, Inc. ILG ), in 2018 (the ILG Acquisition as Legacy-ILG. We refer to the business we conducted prior to the ILG Acquisition and the associated brands as Legacy-MVW. We refer to the business and brand that we acquired in the acquisition of Welk Hospitality Group, Inc. Welk in 2021 (the Welk Acquisition as Legacy-Welk. During 2023, we rebranded all Legacy-Welk resorts as Hyatt Vacation Club resorts. Additionally, we use the term Marriott Vacation Ownership to refer to our Marriott-, Sheraton-, and Westin-brands and the term Hyatt Vacation Ownership to refer to our Hyatt-brands. 
 We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform with our current year presentation.

 The total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits was million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of million, which is predominantly attributable to the expiration of statutes of limitation, partially offset by additional interest and penalties related to non-U.S. uncertain tax positions. At September 30, 2024, unrecognized tax benefits (including interest and penalties) of million, net of indemnification, would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. 
 We anticipate million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, to be indemnified pursuant to a Tax Matters Agreement dated May 11, 2016 by and among Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide, Inc., Vistana Signature Experiences, Inc., and Interval Leisure Group, Inc., and consequently have recorded a corresponding indemnification asset.

 Credit Quality Indicators - Vacation Ownership Notes Receivable 
 We use the origination of vacation ownership notes receivable and the FICO scores of the customer by brand as the primary credit quality indicators, as historical performance indicates that there is a relationship between the default behavior of borrowers by FICO score and the brand associated with the vacation ownership interest VOI they have acquired. The estimates of the variable consideration for originated vacation ownership notes receivable and the reserve for credit losses on the acquired vacation ownership notes receivable are based on default rates that are an output of our static pool analyses and estimates regarding future defaults. 
 In the third quarter of 2023, we increased our vacation ownership notes receivable reserve to reflect then-current trends in delinquencies and default rates. We estimated the amount of the increase in our sales reserve primarily using a historical period of increased defaults. The additional reserves recorded in 2023 adjusted our future default rate estimate to reflect then-current macroeconomic conditions, including inflation outpacing wage growth, continuing high interest rates, mixed economic indicators and increased global insecurity. Subsequent to the third quarter of 2023, we increased our sales reserve rate to provide for higher expected cumulative losses on new originations. 
 We believe the cumulative impact of inflation on consumers and the related impact of year-over-year increases in maintenance fees for 2023 and 2024 are driving continued elevated delinquencies and defaults. As a result, during the second quarter of 2024, we increased our sales reserve by million to reflect increases in expected cumulative loss rates for our vacation ownership notes receivable originated during 2021-2024. In estimating the increase in the sales reserve, we considered then-current macroeconomic conditions, including higher consumer debt levels, moderating inflation, continued high interest rates, uncertainty around timing and frequency of interest rate adjustments and continued mixed economic indicators. 
 The weighted average FICO score within our consolidated vacation ownership notes receivable pool was and , at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, based upon the FICO score of the borrower at the time of origination.

 We estimate the fair value of our vacation ownership notes receivable that have been securitized using a discounted cash flow model. We believe this is comparable to the model that an independent third party would use in the current market. Our model uses default rates, prepayment rates, coupon rates, and loan terms for our securitized vacation ownership notes receivable portfolio as key drivers of risk and relative value to determine the fair value of the underlying vacation ownership notes receivable. We concluded that this fair value measurement should be categorized within Level 3. 
 Due to factors that impact the general marketability of our vacation ownership notes receivable that have not been securitized, as well as current market conditions, we bifurcate our non-securitized vacation ownership notes receivable at each balance sheet date into those eligible and not eligible for securitization using criteria applicable to current securitization transactions in the asset-backed securities ABS market. Generally, vacation ownership notes receivable are considered not eligible for securitization if any of the following attributes are present: (1) payments are greater than 30 days past due; (2) the first payment has not been received; or (3) the collateral is located in Asia or Europe. In some cases, eligibility may also be determined based on the credit score of the borrower, the remaining term of the loans and other similar factors that may reflect investor demand in a securitization transaction or the cost to effectively securitize the vacation ownership notes receivable.

The carrying value of the COLI policies is equal to their cash surrender value (Level 2 inputs). 
 Securitized Debt 
 We generate cash flow estimates by modeling all bond tranches for our active vacation ownership notes receivable securitization transactions, with consideration for the collateral specific to each tranche. The key drivers in our analysis include default rates, prepayment rates, bond interest rates, and other structural factors, which we use to estimate the projected cash flows. In order to estimate market credit spreads by rating, we obtain indicative credit spreads from investment banks that actively issue and facilitate the market for vacation ownership securities and determine an average credit spread by rating level of the different tranches. We then apply those estimated market spreads to swap rates in order to estimate an underlying discount rate for calculating the fair value of the active bonds payable. We concluded that this fair value measurement should be categorized within Level 3. 
 Term Loan 
 We estimate the fair value of our Term Loan (as defined in Footnote 12 Debt using quotes from securities dealers as of the last trading day for the quarter; however, this loan has only a limited trading history and volume, and as such, this fair value estimate is not necessarily indicative of the value at which the Term Loan could be retired or transferred. We concluded that this fair value measurement should be categorized within Level 3. 
 Revolving Corporate Credit Facility 
 We estimate that the gross carrying value of our Revolving Corporate Credit Facility (as defined in Footnote 12 Debt approximates fair value as the contractual interest rate is variable plus an applicable margin. We concluded that this fair value measurement should be categorized within Level 3. 
 Senior Notes 
 We estimate the fair value of our 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes (each as defined in Footnote 12 Debt using quoted market prices as of the last trading day for the quarter; however, these notes have only a limited trading history and volume, and as such, this fair value estimate is not necessarily indicative of the value at which these notes could be retired or transferred. We concluded that this fair value measurement should be categorized within Level 2. 
 Convertible Notes 
 We estimate the fair value of our convertible notes using quoted market prices as of the last trading day for the quarter; however, these notes have only a limited trading history and volume, and as such, this fair value estimate is not necessarily indicative of the value at which the convertible notes could be retired or transferred. We concluded that this fair value measurement should be categorized within Level 2.

 Loss Contingencies 
 In February 2019, the owners association for the St. Regis Residence Club, New York filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, New York County, Commercial Division against ILG and several of its subsidiaries and certain third parties. The operative complaint alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties related to sale and rental practices, aided and abetted certain breaches of fiduciary duty, engaged in self-dealing as the sponsor and manager of the club, tortiously interfered with the management agreement, were unjustly enriched, and engaged in anticompetitive conduct. The plaintiff sought unspecified damages, punitive damages and disgorgement of payments under the management and purchase agreements. In February 2022, the Court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint and dismissed with prejudice all claims except one (such claim, the Remaining Claim ), with respect to which the plaintiff was granted leave to amend its complaint. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint with respect to the Remaining Claim and appealed the dismissal of the other claims. In June 2023, the appellate court upheld the dismissal of those claims. Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of that appellate ruling, and in October 2023, the appellate court denied that motion. In November 2022, the Court granted our motion to dismiss the amended complaint with respect to the Remaining Claim and again granted plaintiff leave to amend its complaint. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint with respect to the Remaining Claim and again appealed the dismissal of the other claims. In January 2024, the appellate court upheld the dismissal of the other claims. In September 2023, the Court granted our motion to dismiss the amended complaint with respect to the Remaining Claim and denied plaintiff permission to file any additional amended complaints. Plaintiff s appeal of the September 2023 ruling was dismissed as untimely by the appellate court on June 10, 2024. 
 In the ordinary course of our business, various claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us. A number of these lawsuits and claims may exist at any given time. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic may give rise to various claims and lawsuits from owners, members and other parties. We record and accrue for legal contingencies when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In making such determinations, we evaluate, among other things, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred, our ability to make a reasonable estimate of loss. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances.

 Exchange Third-Party Management includes an exchange network and membership programs, as well as provision of management services to other resorts and lodging properties. We provide these services through our Interval International and Aqua-Aston businesses. Exchange Third-Party Management revenue generally is fee-based and derived from membership, exchange, and rental transactions, property and owners association management, and other related products and services. 
 Our CODM evaluates the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses or income taxes. We do not allocate corporate interest expense or indirect general and administrative expenses to our segments. We include interest income specific to segment activities within the appropriate segment. We allocate depreciation and amortization, other gains and losses, equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures, and noncontrolling interest to each of our segments as appropriate. Corporate and other represents that portion of our results that are not allocable to our segments, including those relating to consolidated owners associations, as our CODM does not use this information to make operating segment resource allocations. 
 Our CODM uses Adjusted Earnings before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments, and the components of net income attributable to common stockholders excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to common stockholders, before interest expense (excluding consumer financing interest expense associated with term securitization transactions), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding share-based compensation expense and adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our operating performance.

 Business Overview 
 We are a leading global vacation company that offers vacation ownership, exchange, rental and resort and property management, along with related businesses, products and services. Our business operates in two reportable segments: Vacation Ownership and Exchange Third-Party Management. 
 Our Vacation Ownership segment includes a diverse portfolio of resorts that includes some of the world s most iconic brands licensed under exclusive long-term relationships. We are the exclusive worldwide developer, marketer, seller and manager of vacation ownership and related products under the Marriott Vacation Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, Sheraton Vacation Club, Westin Vacation Club, and Hyatt Vacation Club brands. We are also the exclusive worldwide developer, marketer and seller of vacation ownership and related products under The Ritz-Carlton Club brand, and we have the non-exclusive right to develop, market and sell whole ownership residential products under The Ritz-Carlton Residences brand. We also have a license to use the St. Regis brand for specified fractional ownership products. 
 Our Vacation Ownership segment generates most of its revenues from four primary sources: selling vacation ownership products; managing vacation ownership resorts, clubs and owners associations; financing consumer purchases of vacation ownership products; and renting vacation ownership inventory. 
 Our Exchange Third-Party Management segment includes an exchange network and membership programs, as well as the provision of management services to other resorts and lodging properties. Exchange Third-Party Management revenue generally is fee-based and derived from membership, exchange and rental transactions, property and owners association management, and other related products and services. We provide these services through our Interval International and Aqua-Aston businesses. 
 Corporate and other represents that portion of our results that are not allocable to our segments, including those relating to consolidated property owners associations Consolidated Property Owners Associations ). 
 We recently launched a strategic business operations function to lead modernization, process improvement and long-term value generating initiatives across our business. We believe we can drive 50 million to 100 million of annual efficiencies over the next two years and plan to reinvest some of these savings to accelerate revenue growth and enhance our customer platforms, products, and services. 
 We routinely post important information, including news releases, announcements and other statements about our business and results of operations, that may be deemed material to investors on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.marriottvacationsworldwide.com. We use our website as a means of disclosing material, nonpublic information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Investors should monitor the Investor Relations section of our website in addition to following our press releases, filings with the SEC, public conference calls and webcasts. The information on our website is not part of, and is not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report.

 Performance Measures 
 We measure operating performance using the key metrics described below: 
 Contract sales from the sale of vacation ownership products, which consists of the total amount of vacation ownership product sales under contracts signed during the period where we have generally received a down payment of at least ten percent of the contract price, reduced by actual rescissions during the period, inclusive of contracts associated with sales of vacation ownership products on behalf of third parties, which we refer to as resales. In circumstances where customers apply any or all of their existing ownership interests as part of the purchase price for additional interests, we include only the incremental value purchased as contract sales. Contract sales differ from revenues from the sale of vacation ownership products that we report on our income statements due to the requirements for revenue recognition, the reserve for vacation ownership notes receivable and adjustments for sales incentives that will not be recognized as Sale of vacation ownership products revenue and other adjustments to Sale of vacation ownership products revenue. We consider contract sales to be an important operating measure because it reflects the pace of sales in our business. 
 Total contract sales include contract sales from the sale of vacation ownership products including non-consolidated joint ventures. 
 Consolidated contract sales exclude contract sales from the sale of vacation ownership products for non-consolidated joint ventures. 
 Volume per guest VPG is calculated by dividing consolidated vacation ownership contract sales, excluding fractional sales, telesales, resales, and other sales that are not attributed to a sales tour (referred to as Tours ), by the number of tours in a given period. Tours refers to the number of sales tours performed during the applicable period, and generally include virtual and offsite sales tours, and exclude telesales. We believe that VPG is valuable in evaluating the effectiveness of the sales process as it combines the impact of average contract price with the number of touring guests who make a purchase. We believe that tours is a valuable metric because it represents the volume of touring guests. 
 Development profit margin is calculated by dividing Development profit by revenues from the sale of vacation ownership products. We refer to revenues from the sale of vacation ownership products less the cost of vacation ownership products and marketing and sales costs as Development profit . We believe that Development profit margin is an important measure of the profitability of our development and subsequent marketing and sales of VOIs. 
 Total active members is the number of Interval Network active members at the end of the applicable period. We consider active members to be an important metric because it represents the population of owners eligible to book transactions using the Interval Network. 
 Average revenue per member is calculated by dividing membership fee revenue, transaction revenue, rental revenue, and other member revenue for the Interval Network by the monthly weighted average number of Interval Network active members during the applicable period. We believe this metric is valuable in measuring the overall engagement of our Interval Network active members. 
 Segment financial results attributable to common stockholders represents revenues less expenses directly attributable to each applicable reportable business segment (Vacation Ownership and Exchange Third-Party Management). We consider this measure to be important in evaluating the performance of our reportable business segments. See Footnote 16 Business Segments to our Financial Statements for further information about our reportable business segments. 
 Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenues less cost reimbursement revenues. 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Segment Adjusted EBITDA by the applicable segment s total revenues less cost reimbursement revenues.

 Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA, a financial measure that is not prescribed by GAAP, is defined as earnings, or net income attributable to common stockholders, before interest expense, net (excluding consumer financing interest expense associated with term securitization transactions), income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA reflects additional adjustments for certain items, and excludes share-based compensation expense to address considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense because companies use share-based payment awards differently, both in the type and quantity of awards granted. For purposes of our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin calculations, we do not adjust for consumer financing interest expense associated with term securitization transactions because we consider it to be an operating expense of our business. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an indicator of operating performance, which we use to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, expand our business, and return cash to stockholders. We consider Adjusted EBITDA margin to be an indicator of our operating performance. We also use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as do analysts, lenders, investors, and others, because these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company s capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provisions for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin also exclude depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful as an indicator of operating performance because it allows for period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before the impact of the excluded items. We believe Adjusted EBITDA margin is useful as an indicator of operating profitability because it allows for period-over-period 
 39

 comparisons of the profitability of our ongoing core operations before the impact of the excluded items. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin also facilitate comparisons by us, analysts, investors, and others of results from our ongoing core operations before the impact of these items with results from other companies. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin differently than we do or may not calculate them at all, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. The table below shows our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculation and reconciles these measures with Net income attributable to common stockholders, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

 Third Quarter and First Three Quarters 
 Contract sales increased during the third quarter and first three quarters of 2024 due to higher tours in each period compared to prior year periods of 10 and 6 , respectively, partially offset by lower VPGs of 4 and 5 , respectively. The decrease in VPG in both periods was due to a decline in first time buyer VPG and a larger percentage mix of international tours, which carry a lower VPG than domestic tours, partially offset by a slight increase in VPG from existing owners, and the ongoing impact from the lack of comparability of activity at our Maui sales centers given the wildfires. Excluding the 15 million increase at our Maui sales centers in the third quarter of 2024, contract sales and tours increased 2 and 6 , respectively. Excluding the 17 million decline at our Maui sales centers in the first three quarters of 2024, contract sales and tours increased 2 and 7 , respectively. We expect our full year 2024 contract sales will reflect lower VPG for the last quarter of 2024, partially offset by growth in first time buyer tours, which carry a lower VPG. 
 In the third quarter of 2023, we increased our vacation ownership notes receivable reserve to reflect then-current trends in delinquencies and default rates. We estimated the amount of the increase in our sales reserve primarily using a historical period of increased defaults. The 59 million additional reserves recorded in 2023 adjusted our future default rate estimate to reflect then-current macroeconomic conditions, including inflation outpacing wage growth, continuing high interest rates, mixed economic indicators and increased global insecurity. Subsequent to the third quarter of 2023, we increased our sales reserve rate to provide for higher expected cumulative losses on new originations. 
 We believe the cumulative impact of inflation on consumers and the related impact of higher than historical year-over-year increases in maintenance fees for 2023 and 2024 have continued to drive elevated delinquencies and defaults. As a result of the elevated delinquencies and defaults, during the second quarter of 2024, we increased our sales reserve by 70 million to reflect increases in expected cumulative loss rates for our vacation ownership notes receivable originated during 2021-2024. In estimating the increase in the sales reserve, we considered then-current macroeconomic conditions, including higher consumer debt levels, moderating inflation, continued high interest rates, uncertainty around timing and frequency of interest rate adjustments and continued mixed economic indicators. As expected, maintenance fee increases for our points based products for 2025, which were approved by the relevant property owners association, returned to normal, however, consistent with the 2024 third quarter, we plan to continue to assume an increased sales reserve for new originations until we have sufficient evidence of improvement in delinquency and default rates.

 Third Quarter 
 Rental profit, excluding profit from owned hotels, increased due to: 
 8 million of higher plus points revenue; and 
 an 8 million increase in costs allocated to marketing and sales expense for occupancy used for previews. 
 These changes were partially offset by: 
 3 million of increased costs associated with higher owner utilization of third-party vacation and other offerings; and 
 2 million of higher unsold maintenance fees associated with developer-owned inventory. 
 Rental profit for our owned hotels remained in-line with the third quarter of 2023. 
 First Three Quarters 
 Rental profit, excluding profit from owned hotels, increased due to: 
 31 million of higher plus points revenue; and

 These changes were partially offset by: 
 9 million of increased costs associated with higher owner utilization of third-party vacation and other offerings; and 
 7 million of decreased profit due to a lower average transient rate on higher keys rented and higher tidy and variable costs. 
 Rental profit for our owned hotels remained in-line with the first three quarters of 2023.

 Financing Revenues, Expenses and Profit

 Third Quarter and First Three Quarters 
 Financing revenues reflect higher interest income as a result of a higher average notes receivable balances and a slightly higher average interest rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The higher average notes receivable balances resulted from new loan originations in excess of the repayment of existing vacation ownership notes receivable, which we expect to continue for the remainder of 2024. 
 The increase in consumer financing interest expense is attributable to the higher average securitized debt at a higher average interest rate for our more recent term securitization transactions. 
 We expect our average interest rate to continue to increase as the current interest rate environment for new securitization transactions is above the average interest rate on our existing securitized debt. We do not adjust interest rates on consumer financing offerings at the same pace as, or in lock-step with, broader market interest rates; as a result, we expect our financing profit margin to continue to decrease in 2024, as we repay existing securitization transactions with lower interest rates.

 Our effective tax rate was 28.7 and 36.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the blended statutory tax rate for the same period due to income tax adjustments for discrete items, including an 11 million decrease related to changes in valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in non-U.S. jurisdictions and a 6 million decrease primarily attributable to the expiration of statutes of limitation on certain unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by an 8 million increase to remove the permanent reinvestment assertion for our earnings in certain non-U.S. entities and an increase of 3 million for deferred non-U.S. withholding taxes. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the blended statutory tax rate for the same period due to losses in non-U.S. jurisdictions for which we do not realize tax benefits.

 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the blended statutory tax rate for the same period due to income tax adjustments for discrete items, including an 18 million increase to pre-acquisition reserves for unrecognized tax benefits. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has proposed a global minimum tax of 15 of reported profits Pillar 2 that has been agreed upon in principle by over 140 non-U.S. countries. Although the model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar 2 differently than the model rules and/or on different timelines. While we continue to monitor legislative developments, we do not anticipate Pillar 2 will have a material impact on our 2024 or long-term financial results. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Typically, our capital needs are supported by cash on hand, cash generated from operations, our ability to access funds under the Warehouse Credit Facility and the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility, our ability to raise capital through securitizations in the ABS market, and, to the extent necessary, our ability to issue new debt and refinance existing debt. We believe these sources of capital will be adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, satisfy debt service requirements, fulfill other cash requirements, and return capital to stockholders. We continuously monitor the capital markets to evaluate the effect that changes in market conditions may have on our ability to fund our liquidity needs. 
 At September 30, 2024, our corporate debt, net of cash and equivalents, to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.9, above our targeted range of 2.5 to 3.0, and we remain focused on reducing this ratio by the end of 2025. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we amended the Corporate Credit Facility to provide for a new 800 million term loan facility that is scheduled to mature on April 1, 2031, the New Term Loan. The proceeds of the New Term Loan were used to refinance in full the Term Loan, which had a balance of 784 million as of March 31, 2024 and was scheduled to mature on August 31, 2025. We have no material principal payment obligations on our debt prior to 2026. See Footnote 12 Debt to our Financial Statements for further information related to maturities of our debt.

Table of Contents 

 Sources of Liquidity 
 Cash from Operations 
 Our primary sources of funds from operations are (1) cash sales and down payments on financed sales, (2) cash from our financing operations, including principal and interest payments received on outstanding vacation ownership notes receivable, (3) cash from fee-based membership, exchange and rental transactions, and (4) net cash generated from our rental and resort management and other services operations. 
 Vacation Ownership Notes Receivable Securitizations 
 We periodically securitize, without recourse through bankruptcy remote special purpose entities, the majority of the notes receivable originated in connection with the sale of vacation ownership products to institutional investors in the ABS term securitization market. These vacation ownership notes receivable securitizations provide liquidity for general corporate purposes. In a vacation ownership notes receivable term securitization, several classes of debt securities issued by a special purpose entity are collateralized by a single pool of transferred vacation ownership notes receivable. In connection with each vacation ownership notes receivable securitization, we may retain all or a portion of the securities that are issued. 
 Typically, we receive cash at inception of the term securitization transaction for the amount of notes issued less fees and monies held in reserve and we receive cash during the life of the transaction in amounts reflecting the excess spread of interest received on the related vacation ownership notes receivable less the interest payable on the ABS securities, less administrative fees and amounts from related vacation ownership notes receivable that default. Given the recent increase in delinquencies and defaults above historical averages, the cash excess spread we received from our securitization transactions has been lower than previously anticipated. At the recent level of defaults, there is no impact to cash whether we repurchase defaulted vacation ownership notes receivable from a securitization VIE and pursue foreclosure or foreclose on behalf of a securitization VIE. 
 Each of the securitized vacation ownership notes receivable transactions contains various triggers relating to the performance of the underlying vacation ownership notes receivable. If a pool of securitized vacation ownership notes receivable fails to perform within the pool s parameters (default or delinquency thresholds vary by transaction), transaction provisions effectively redirect the monthly excess spread of interest accruing on the related vacation ownership notes receivable less the interest accruing on the ABS securities and fees we would otherwise receive from that pool (attributable to the interests we retained) to accelerate the principal payments to investors (taking into account the subordination of the different tranches to the extent there are multiple tranches) until the performance trigger is cured. During the third quarter of 2024, and as of September 30, 2024, we had 15 term securitization transactions outstanding, all of which were in compliance with their respective required parameters. Since 2000, we have issued approximately 9.8 billion of debt securities in securitization transactions in the term ABS market, excluding amounts securitized through warehouse credit facilities or private bank transactions. 
 On an ongoing basis, we have the ability to use our Warehouse Credit Facility to securitize, on a revolving non-recourse basis, eligible consumer loans derived from certain vacation ownership sales. Those loans may later be transferred to term securitization transactions in the ABS market, which typically occur twice a year. During the second quarter of 2024, we amended certain agreements associated with our Warehouse Credit Facility, which extended the revolving period from May 31, 2025 to June 11, 2026. At September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Warehouse Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 70 million of gross vacation ownership notes receivable were eligible for securitization. 
 Revolving Corporate Credit Facility 
 Our Revolving Corporate Credit Facility, which expires on March 31, 2027, provides for up to 750 million of aggregate borrowings for general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, letters of credit, and acquisitions. At September 30, 2024, 75 million of borrowings and 20 million of le tters of credit were outstanding under our Revolving Corporate Credit Facility. 
 Uses of Cash 
 We minimize our working capital needs through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and disciplined collection efforts. Our working capital needs fluctuate throughout the year given the timing of annual maintenance fees on unsold inventory we pay to owners associations and certain annual compensation-related outflows. In addition, our cash from operations varies due to the timing of repayment by owners of vacation ownership notes receivable, the closing or recording of sales contracts for vacation ownership products, financing propensity, and cash outlays for inventory acquisitions and development. 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 Seasonality 
 Our cash flow from operations fluctuates during the year due to the timing of certain receipts and contractual and compensation-related payments. Significant changes in cash flow can result from the timing of our collection of maintenance fees, club dues, and other customer payments, which typically occurs in either the fourth quarter or the first quarter of each year. Generally, cash outflows related to our payment of maintenance fees associated with unsold inventory occurs in the fourth quarter for our points-based products, and in the first quarter for our weeks-based products. In addition, during the first quarter of each year, we typically have significant variable compensation-related cash outflows associated with payment of annual bonuses. 
 Timing of Estimated Tax Payments 
 The Internal Revenue Service provided for the deferral of federal income tax payments as tax relief for businesses in parts of Florida affected by the hurricanes that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of 2024. This relief allows us to delay making certain estimated tax payments, without interest or penalty. As a result, we expect to defer 28 million of payments from 2024 to the second quarter of 2025. Similarly, in the prior year, 32 million of estimated tax payments from the third and fourth quarters of 2023 were deferred to the first quarter 2024 related to hurricanes that occurred in 2023. 
 
 Operations 
 In addition to net income and adjustments for non-cash items, the following are key drivers of our cash flow from operating activities: 
 
 Inventory Spending (In Excess of) Less Than Cost of Sales 
 Nine Months Ended in millions) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Inventory spending (159) (56) Purchase of property for future transfer to inventory (27) Inventory costs 107 137 Inventory spending (in excess of) less than cost of sales (52) 54 
 Although we have significant inventory on hand, we intend to continue selectively pursuing growth opportunities by targeting high-quality inventory that allows us to add desirable new destinations to our systems with new on-site sales locations. Where possible, we will structure transactions to limit our up-front capital investment and allow us to purchase finished inventory closer to the time it is needed for sale. These capital efficient vacation ownership transaction structures may consist of the development of new inventory, or the conversion of previously built units, by third parties. In addition, we may develop inventory on our balance sheet in key markets where we believe the opportunities will generate acceptable risk adjusted returns. 
 Through our existing VOI repurchase program, we proactively acquire previously sold VOIs from owners associations and individual owners at lower costs than would be required to develop new inventory. Among other reasons for repurchasing inventory, we expect these repurchases will help stabilize the future cost of our vacation ownership products. 
 Our spending for real estate inventory in the first three quarters of 2024 was higher than cost of sales due to our acquisition of vacation ownership units in Waikiki and purchases under our VOI repurchase programs. Refer to Footnote 3 Acquisitions for information about acquisitions that occurred during the first three quarters of 2024. Purchases of property for future transfer to inventory in 2023 included the acquisition of property in Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia. We expect inventory spending to continue to exceed cost of sales for the remainder of 2024.

 Distribution Date Dividend per Share December 7, 2023 December 21, 2023 January 4, 2024 0.76 February 15, 2024 February 29, 2024 March 14, 2024 0.76 May 9, 2024 May 23, 2024 June 6, 2024 0.76 
 We currently expect to pay quarterly dividends in the future, but any future dividend payments will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors, which will depend on our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements at the time, as well as applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice, and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. In addition, our Corporate Credit Facility and the indentures governing our senior notes contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, and the terms of agreements governing debt that we may incur in the future may also limit or prohibit the payment of dividends. The payment of certain cash dividends may also result in an adjustment to the conversion rate of our convertible notes in a manner adverse to us. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future at any particular rate or at all.

 Material Cash Requirements 
 The following table summarizes our future material cash requirements from known contractual or other obligations as of September 30, 2024:

 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments and excludes unamortized debt discount and issuance costs. 
 (2) During the second quarter of 2024, we amended the Corporate Credit Facility to provide for the New Term Loan, which is scheduled to mature on April 1, 2031. The proceeds from the New Term Loan were used to refinance in full the Term Loan, which had a balance of 784 million as of March 31, 2024, and was scheduled to mature on August 31, 2025. 
 (3) Payments based on estimated timing of cash flow associated with securitized vacation ownership notes receivable. 
 (4) Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Amounts reflected herein represent expected funding requirements under such contracts and primarily relate to future purchases of property and vacation ownership units and information technology assets (hardware and software). Amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. 
 (5) Includes interest. 
 In the normal course of our resort management business, we enter into purchase commitments on behalf of owners associations to manage the daily operating needs of our resorts. Since we are reimbursed for these commitments from the cash flows of the owners associations, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. These purchase commitments are excluded from the table above. 
 
 Supplemental Guarantor Information 
 The 2028 Notes are guaranteed by MVWC, Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc. MORI ), and certain other subsidiaries whose voting securities are wholly owned directly or indirectly by MORI (such subsidiaries collectively, the Senior Notes Guarantors ). These guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. The guarantees of the Senior Notes Guarantors are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. 
 The following tables present consolidating financial information as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for MVWC and MORI on a stand-alone basis (collectively, the Issuers ), the Senior Notes Guarantors, the combined non-guarantor subsidiaries of MVWC, and MVW on a consolidated basis.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Footnote 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Standards to our Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including information about new accounting standards and the future adoption of such standards. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. We have discussed those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application in our 2023 Annual Report. Since the date of our 2023 Annual Report, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or the methodologies or assumptions we apply under them.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk has not changed materially from that disclosed in Part I, Item 7A of the 2023 Annual Report, other than as set forth below. 
 We manage the interest rate risk on our corporate debt through the use of fixed-rate debt and may also use interest rate hedges to fix a portion of our variable-rate debt. At September 30, 2024, the interest rate applicable to 70 (approximately 2.0 billion) of our corporate debt, excluding finance leases, was fixed and the interest rate applicable to the remaining 30 (approximately 873 million) was variable. Assuming we had no outstanding balance under our Revolving Corporate Credit Facility, a 100 basis point increase in the underlying benchmark rate on our variable-rate debt at September 30, 2024 would result in an annual increase in cash interest of approximately 8 million. 
 The following table presents the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of September 30, 2024 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: 
 in millions) Average Interest Rate Maturities by Period Remainder of 2024

The proceeds from the New Term Loan were used to refinance in full the Term Loan, which had a balance of 784 million as of March 31, 2024, and was scheduled to mature on August 31, 2025. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), and management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance about management s control objectives. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. However, the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Based upon the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that we record, process, summarize and report the information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 provide reasonable assurance that we accumulate and communicate such information to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions about required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We made no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Part II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Currently, and from time to time, we are subject to claims in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business, including, among others, the legal actions discussed under Loss Contingencies in Footnote 10 Contingencies and Commitments to our Financial Statements. While management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, cash flows, or overall trends in results of operations, legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and unfavorable rulings could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Item 1A to Part 1 of our 2023 Annual Report, except to the extent factual information disclosed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report relates to such risk factors, which is incorporated herein by reference.

If the parties cannot agree to a timeline for implementation of the modification within thirty (30) days following receipt of Licensee s notice pursuant to this Section 7.2.C, then Licensor may object to the proposed modification on that basis. If Licensor does not consent or object to such proposed modifications to the Brand Standards within thirty (30) days following receipt of Licensee s notice pursuant to this Section 7.2.C, such proposed modifications shall be deemed consented to by Licensor and will take effect as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. 
 D. Except as provided in Section 7.2.E, in the event of a dispute regarding proposed modifications to any aspect of the Brand Standards with respect to which either party has consent rights 
 27 
 909953-1 

under Section 7.2.B or 7.2.C (other than consents that may be granted or withheld in Licensor s sole discretion), either party may refer the matter to an Expert for resolution pursuant to Section 22.5. 
 (i) For modifications regarding physical aspects of the Brand Standards proposed by Licensor, the Expert will determine whether Licensor s proposed modifications are consistent with changes to the applicable lodging brand segment(s) and otherwise applicable to, and appropriate for, the Licensed Business. 
 (ii) For modifications proposed by Licensee, the Expert will determine whether Licensor s objection to Licensee s proposed modifications is reasonable, taking into account Licensor s brand standards for the Upscale Brand Segment, Upper-Upscale Brand Segment and or Luxury Brand Segment, as applicable, of Licensor Lodging Facilities, the applicability of such standards to Licensed Destination Club Projects and Licensed Residential Projects, the appropriate differences between hotel service levels and service levels applicable to the Licensed Destination Club Business and the Licensed Whole Ownership Residential Business, and whether the failure to implement such modifications will or may adversely affect the Upscale Brand Segment and Upper-Upscale Brand Segment of Licensor Lodging Facilities that bear the Marriott, Sheraton or Westin name or the Luxury Brand Segment of Licensor Lodging Facilities that bear the St. Regis or Luxury Collection name. 
 If the Expert determines that any such proposed modifications are appropriate, such modifications shall take effect within a reasonable period of time after the Expert s determination, taking into account applicable factors and circumstances, such as whether such modifications are required or restricted by Applicable Law, the need to obtain approval and or funding from Property Owners Associations, the sequencing of such modifications into the renovation and refurbishment schedules of existing Projects, and the applicable Specified Licensed Brand Hotel implementation schedule with respect to such modifications. If the Expert determines that such proposed modifications are not appropriate, then the Brand Standards will not be modified to reflect such modifications with respect to the Licensed Business. 
 E. In the event that Licensee does not consent to modifications to any service aspect of the Brand Standards proposed by Licensor with respect to which Licensee has consent rights under Section 7.2.B, and customer satisfaction levels at the Projects decrease greater than five (5) percentage points during the twelve (12) month period immediately following the date on which such change was to have been implemented, the parties shall investigate the reason(s) for the decrease. If the failure to implement one or more proposed modifications to any service aspect of the Brand Standards is determined to be a material reason for any such decrease, then Licensee shall promptly implement such modifications, taking into account applicable factors and circumstances, such as whether such modifications are required or restricted by Applicable Law, the need to obtain approval and or funding from Property Owners Associations, the sequencing of such modifications into the renovation and refurbishment schedules of existing Projects, and the applicable Specified Licensed Brand Hotel implementation schedule with respect to such modifications. 
 F. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall limit in any manner Licensor s or its Affiliates ability to modify or change any standards applicable to Licensor s Lodging Business or Whole Ownership Residential Business, or any other business or activity in which Licensor or its Affiliates may engage from time to time, other than the Licensed Destination Club Business or the Licensed Whole Ownership Residential Business.

7.3 Centralized Services for Specified Fractional Projects. 
 A. Licensor shall provide or make available to Licensee for use in the operation of each Specified Fractional Project those programs and services that it provides or makes available on a centralized basis to substantially all of the Licensor Lodging Facilities operating under the same brand or to a category thereof in which the relevant Specified Fractional Project would be included if it was a Licensor Lodging Facility in the same region (the Centralized Services ). Licensor or any of its designees shall have the exclusive right to maintain and administer the Centralized Services. The Centralized Services may be provided by one or more of Licensor, its Affiliates, or any third parties designated by Licensor, and Licensor may own or have investments in the suppliers and other providers of the Centralized Services. Licensor may (i) change the structure, scope, delivery and terms of any Centralized Service, (ii) add a new, or discontinue all or part of an existing, Centralized Service or (iii) make a mandatory Centralized Service optional, or an optional Centralized Service mandatory, in each case as Licensor deems advisable from time to time provided that such changes are applicable to the Licensor Lodging Facilities operating under the same brand. 
 B. Unless Licensor agrees in writing to an exception with respect thereto (including due to differences between the Specified Fractional Projects and the Licensor Lodging Facilities operating under the same brand), each Specified Fractional Project shall participate in all Centralized Services that Licensor designates as mandatory and may participate in any of the Centralized Services made available to Licensee that Licensor designates as optional provided that, in each case, the relevant Specified Fractional Project is treated in a manner consistent with the manner in which the Licensor Lodging Facilities operating under the same brand are treated, or a category thereof in which the affected Specified Fractional Project would be included if it was a Licensor Lodging Facility. The Centralized Services may not benefit all participants proportionately. Licensee shall comply with all Brand Standards applicable to the Centralized Services in which a Specified Fractional Project participates, including executing any related documents. Licensee at its expense shall purchase and install all FF&E necessary for a Specified Fractional Project to participate in the Centralized Services required under this Agreement or any other written agreement between Licensor and Licensee or their respective Affiliates. Licensee shall provide Licensor with at least ninety (90) days notice to terminate a Specified Fractional Project s participation in an optional Centralized Service. Licensee shall not use the Centralized Services in connection with any other property, site, business, product, service or activity at any time or allow any Specified Fractional Project to participate in any program or receive any services that are similar to the mandatory Centralized Services, without Licensor s prior approval. Licensor has provided to Licensee a true and complete list of all mandatory Centralized Services as of the Effective Date. 
 C. Fees for Centralized Services with respect to each Specified Fractional Project Centralized Services Charges shall be determined by Licensor on a fair and commercially reasonable basis in a manner consistent with the manner in which such charges are made with respect to substantially all of the Licensor Lodging Facilities operating under the same brand or a category thereof in which the Specified Fractional Project would be included if it was a Licensor Lodging Facility receiving the services or participating in the programs and systems to which such fees, expenses or costs are applicable, subject to modifications agreed to in writing by Licensor and Licensee (including those due to differences between the Specified Fractional Project and the applicable Licensor Lodging Facilities). The Centralized Services Charges may include amounts reasonably calculated to cover Licensor s or its Affiliates overheads and other costs incurred in providing (or arranging for the provision of) the Centralized Services, including costs of personnel and equipment and developing, promoting, operating, maintaining and upgrading the Centralized Services and associated Electronic Systems. The Centralized Services Charges also may include fees and costs from third-party providers of Centralized Services, or if Licensor or its Affiliates pay such fees or costs directly, Licensee shall reimburse such amounts. Licensor may increase or decrease any Centralized Services Charges from time to time provided that such changes are applicable to substantially 
 29 
 909953-1 

all of the Licensor Lodging Facilities operating under the same brand or to a category thereof in which the Specified Fractional Project would be included if it was a Licensor Lodging Facility, subject to any appropriate modifications agreed to in writing by Licensor to reflect appropriate differences between the applicable Licensor Lodging Facilities and such Specified Fractional Project. The Centralized Services Charges might not benefit all participants proportionately and Licensor and its Affiliates shall determine in their sole discretion how and when the Centralized Services Charges, including but not limited to funds collected for sales and marketing, are spent and allocated on behalf of a region, locality or subset of participants. The Centralized Services do not create any trust and Licensor and its Affiliates do not act as trustee or in any other fiduciary capacity with respect to the Centralized Services Charges. 
 D. The Centralized Services Charges for mandatory Centralized Services shall be calculated to reimburse costs, including pass-through fees of third-party suppliers, and shall not include a mark-up that results in a profit for Licensor or its Affiliates. In any given year the amount of Centralized Services Charges collected might differ from the cost of delivering Centralized Services and Licensor may use any surplus to fund the deficit from a previous year or the delivery of Centralized Services in a future year. Any such surplus, and any interest earned on the Centralized Services Charges retained by Licensor, shall not be deemed a profit. Licensor and its Affiliates may accept marketing or promotional funds from manufacturers and suppliers of goods or services made available through a Centralized Service. Such funds shall be used for programs intended to benefit the brands covered by the Licensed Marks and or other Licensor brands and in accordance with any manufacturer or supplier requirements. 
 E. The Centralized Services Charges for optional Centralized Services may include a mark-up that results in a profit for Licensor or its Affiliates. Licensor and its Affiliates may use the systems, resources and assets related to the Centralized Services to deliver products, services and programs to third parties for a profit by way of a trademark license fee, price mark up, administrative fee, commission, sale- leaseback arrangement, contribution for marketing or promotions and other forms of compensation.

Licensee s failure to comply with subsections 9.4(i) through (iii) shall be a default under this Agreement and will result in Licensee failing to have met the conditions precedent to converting the Project to another brand. 
 9.5 Services and Products Made Available to Members and Marketing and Exchange Arrangements. 
 A. Licensee may only enter into marketing arrangements with respect to the Licensed Business with third parties, and may only make available to Members those products and services (including Exchange Programs), (i) that are consistent with the brand positioning of the Licensed Business and, with respect to such marketing arrangements, are in compliance with the Brand Standards or (ii) that were in place as of the Original Effective Date or that are consistent with Licensee s practice during the period from January 1, 2005 until the Original Effective Date, as reasonably demonstrated by Licensee.

Licensor will notify Licensee of such objection, and the parties will engage in discussions and attempt to agree on modifications to such practice(s) so that such practice(s) will be in compliance with the Brand Standards. For local marketing alliances, the positioning of the Project in the local market shall be the governing standard. 
 B. Licensee shall have the right to seek prior written confirmation from Licensor on a confidential basis that any proposed program or arrangement is consistent with applicable Brand Standards and will not result in a breach of Licensee s obligations under this Agreement.

In either case, if the Expert finds in favor of Licensor, then Licensor s prior written consent shall be required for each New Licensee Program that is implemented on a system-

Licensee shall not allow its Members of any Project to exchange their right to use and occupy Licensed Destination Club Units or Licensed Unbranded Destination Club Units for stays (or other benefits) at luxury or upscale hotels other than those operated or franchised by Licensor or its Affiliates, except through general Exchange Programs or through tour operator arrangements that are in compliance with Licensor s Brand Standards related to approved distribution channels provided that Licensee shall be permitted to include hotels that are neither Licensor Lodging Facilities nor a part of a Lodging Competitor s hotel system in its Explorer, Club Connections, or similar program in locations where a Licensor Lodging Facility of the same brand segment and of a suitable experience type (e.g., resort) is not available. Licensor will not object to the Exchange Program and tour operator arrangements that Licensee has in place as of the Effective Date as not being in compliance with Brand Standards, and Licensee may continue such arrangements after the Effective Date with respect to the Projects covered thereby provided, however, that Licensee shall not enter into any new or additional such arrangements that do not meet the Brand Standards, and Licensor does not waive any claims related to misuses of the Licensed Marks. Licensee and its Affiliates shall have the right to operate their own Exchange Programs. Licensee may use the Licensed Marks as part of a branded Exchange Program name approved in writing by Licensor. Branded Exchange Programs operated by Licensee or its Affiliates in which both Licensed Destination Club Units and other Destination Club Units participate (including Interval International) shall be subject to commercially reasonable safeguards to be agreed by Licensor and Licensee, such as a prohibition on prominently featuring or marketing products under brands other than the Licensed Marks in such a way as to imply endorsement of such other brands by, or affiliation with, Licensor, and limits on the right of Licensee to use the Licensed Business Customer Information to benefit such Exchange Programs. At Licensor s request, use of the Licensed Marks as part of a branded Exchange Program name shall be discontinued if (i) at any time the aggregate number of Licensed Destination Club Units that participate in such branded Exchange Program is less than one-half (1 2) of the total number of all Destination Club Units that participate in such branded Exchange Program or (ii) Licensee permits Destination Club Units operated under any Hilton Brand to participate in such Exchange Program, provided that if clause (ii) is implicated, Licensee shall, in no event, be required to discontinue such use until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date.

 9.6 Changes in Programs, Services or Benefits. 
 Prior to making any significant systemic changes in the Licensed Destination Club Business or the Licensed Whole Ownership Residential Business (for example, conversion to a points 
 38 
 909953-1 

program), Licensee shall have the right to seek prior written confirmation from Licensor, on a confidential basis, that any such change is consistent with the Brand Standards and will not result in a breach of Licensee s obligations under this Agreement. In the event of a dispute regarding whether any such change is inconsistent with the Brand Standards or would result in a breach (whether or not Licensee sought prior confirmation that the proposed change is consistent with the Brand Standards), the dispute will be referred for Expert resolution pursuant to Section 22.5. 
 
 10. ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 
 10.1 Systems Installation. 
 A. Licensee will, as a cost of the Licensed Business, arrange for the purchase or lease, installation, maintenance, and use at the Projects of all Electronic Systems that Licensor reasonably requires or that Licensee chooses to use in connection with the Licensed Business, in accordance with the Brand Standards and specifications provided by or on behalf of Licensor and may not use such Electronic Systems for anything not specifically related to the Projects and the Licensed Business.

 A. Licensor will make the Reservation System available to Licensee in connection with the Licensed Business, including for reservations relating to Member usage, marketing usage, transient rental usage, and other usages of Licensed Destination Club Units, Licensed Unbranded Destination Club Units and Licensed Residential Units. All Licensed Destination Club Units, Licensed Unbranded Destination Club Units (other than Licensed Unbranded Destination Club Units at the Harborside Resort at Atlantis, which are not currently listed in the Reservation System but will be added to the Reservation System if the parties find a reasonably practicable technology solution for facilitating such listing) and Licensed Residential Units inventory made available by Licensee for transient rental stays of thirty (30) days or less must be listed in the Reservation System, but such inventory shall not be included in Lodging Competitors distribution channels, provided that for the purposes hereof, any distribution channels included within Licensor s channel standards or otherwise approved by Licensor shall not be deemed Lodging Competitors distribution channels. Licensee will comply with all Brand Standards applicable to the Licensed Business related to participation in the Reservation System, including the prohibitions on the inclusion of transient rental inventory other than inventory in Licensor Lodging Facilities or in Projects in elements of the Reservation System visible by customers, travel agents, and other members of the public. For purposes of the foregoing, Licensor and Licensee acknowledge that the seasonal nature of the Licensed Destination Club Business and Member use patterns (including increased Member use in high demand seasons) and leisure-based use patterns (including higher weekend occupancy and lower weekday occupancy) create transient rental inventory availability patterns that may differ from those for Licensor Lodging Facilities. As such, certain Brand Standards relating to participation in the Reservation System may not be suitable for the Licensed Destination Club Business (such as minimum room availability requirements for Brand Loyalty Program redemptions or the 50 Off Associate Rate winter offer). 
 B. If Licensee is in material breach of this Agreement and does not cure the breach as required by Licensor s notice of breach, Licensor may, in addition to any other remedies it may have and in accordance with Section 18.4, suspend Licensee s right to use the Reservation System at one (1) or more of the Projects (or a part of any Project) with respect to transient rentals of Licensed Destination Club Units, Licensed Unbranded Destination Club Units and or Licensed Residential Units until the breach is cured. 
 39 
 909953-1 

In the event such breach relates to one (1) or more Projects, Licensor may exercise its right to suspend Licensee from the Reservation System under this Section 10.2.B with respect to the applicable Project(s). In the event such breach relates to the Licensed Business apart from specific individual Projects or to all or substantially all of the Projects, Licensor may suspend the entire Licensed Business and all of the Projects from the Reservation System under this Section 10.2.B. Licensee covenants not to bring any damages claims against Licensor and its Affiliates arising from Licensee s suspension from the Reservation System under Section 18.4, other than claims that Licensee is not in breach of this Agreement. 
 C. Licensee will have the right to make proposals regarding the Reservation System to Licensor s Reservation Users Group. The parties will agree on a reasonable process for keeping Licensee apprised of initiatives of Licensor s Reservation Users Group that will affect the Licensed Business.

 A. The Electronic Systems not purchased by Licensee will remain the sole property of Licensor or any third party vendors, as applicable.

Licensee acknowledges that the Electronic Systems will be modified, enhanced, replaced, or become obsolete, and that new Electronic Systems may be created to meet the needs of the System and the continual changes in technology and that any such new Electronic Systems will be subject to the terms of the Electronic Systems License Agreement. 
 C. Licensee will have the right to make proposals regarding the Electronic Systems to the appropriate group within Licensor s organization that is responsible for strategic initiatives related to Electronic Systems. The parties will agree on a reasonable process for keeping Licensee apprised of initiatives regarding the Electronic Systems that will affect the Licensed Business. 
 10.4 Proposed Enhancements. 
 Licensor will reasonably consider changes to the Electronic Systems proposed by Licensee which address issues specifically relevant to the Licensed Business (including any enhancements to the Electronic Systems needed to implement such changes). Licensor shall respond to such requests within one hundred twenty (120) days following Licensor s receipt of the written request. Licensor may condition its consent to changes to the Electronic Systems suggested by Licensee based on factors such as Licensee s payment of the costs related to such implementation, including incremental internal or out-of-pocket design costs and operating costs (and the allocation thereof on a fair and commercially reasonable basis to other users of the applicable Electronic Systems who benefit from the change) the difficulties of designing or administering such changes the impact of such changes on the Electronic Systems generally third party consent requirements the prioritization of other Electronic Systems projects the general feasibility of implementing and maintaining such changes over time and considerations relating to owners and franchisees associated with Licensor Lodging Facilities.

The parties acknowledge and agree that future changes in and or replacements of Licensor and its Affiliates and or Licensee s and its Affiliates technologies, systems, business processes, programs and or business partners over the Term of this Agreement Business Changes ), including changes required by Applicable Law or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could make it more difficult, costly, commercially impractical, or even impossible to continue to provide one or more services provided by Licensor or its Affiliates or Licensee or its Affiliates hereunder (the Affected Services ), or could otherwise necessitate changes to the Affected Services. In the event of such a Business Change, Licensee and Licensor agree to discuss, in good faith, making commercially reasonable changes to the Affected Services, including changes to the manner, method, scope, delivery, timing and cost of the Affected Services, or substitution of a similar service that accomplishes the principal underlying purpose or function of the Affected Service, in order to permit the Affected Services to continue on a commercially reasonable basis (such changes, Service Modifications ).

The parties understand and agree that the party receiving an Affected Service shall bear the reasonable incremental expense of any Service Modification, including any increased costs required for the providing party to continue to provide the Affected Service as so modified. The determination of amounts charged to Licensee will be consistent with the manner in which such charges are made with respect to participating Licensor Lodging Facilities, taking into account the manner and extent to which such systems are used in connection with the Licensed Business, as further described in Section 3.3. If the parties cannot agree upon commercially reasonable Service Modifications, taking into consideration any offer made by the party receiving such service to pay the incremental costs of any Service Modification, then the provider of the Affected Service shall no longer be obligated to provide the Affected Service.

For illustrative purposes only, Licensee and its Affiliates would be prohibited from using the following name Napa Valley Destination Club operated by Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation . However, if a jurisdiction recognizes nominative fair use rights and a Member makes nominative fair use of a Licensed Mark in connection with a sale of its interests in a Project in such jurisdiction, then this section is not intended to limit or modify such fair use rights. If Licensee or its Affiliates use the Permitted Corporate Name, the Permitted Licensee Affiliate Names, or any variation thereof in violation of this Section 13.2.A(4), then, in addition to any damages that Licensor or its Affiliates may be entitled to hereunder or under Applicable Law, Licensor will have the right to require Licensee or its Affiliates, as applicable, to pay Royalties for each property with respect to which Licensee or its Affiliates are using the Permitted Corporate Name, the Permitted Licensee Affiliate Names, or a variation thereof, in violation of this Section 13.2.A(4).

Licensor shall have sole responsibility for enforcing the Licensor Intellectual Property at its sole discretion and cost and is entitled to all settlements, damages, costs, attorneys fees or other amounts received from such enforcement efforts. If any such settlement amount or damage award received by Licensor is solely based on damage to or impact on the exclusively licensed aspects of the Licensed Business, then after applying such amount or award toward Licensor s attorneys fees and other costs related to the matter, Licensor will share any remaining portion of the settlement amount or damage award with Licensee in an equitable manner as determined by Licensor based on the relative interests of the parties.

 B. Licensee will, at its expense, submit to Licensor within ninety (90) days following the end of each calendar year during the Term information regarding the length of the terms, renewal rights, and expiration dates of Property Owners Association management agreements. 
 15.3 Licensor Examination and Audit of Licensee s Records. 
 A. Licensor and its authorized representatives have the right, at any time (but not more than once per calendar year, unless an audit reveals an understatement in such year), upon reasonable notice to Licensee, to (i) examine all books, records, and accounts of Licensee for the five (5) years preceding such examination that relate to support for calculation of the Royalty Fees and other amounts payable under this Agreement where the calculation of such amount depends on information provided by Licensee and copy such information that is reasonably necessary for, and relevant to, such audit and (ii) have an independent audit made of any of such books, records, and accounts.

If Licensee in good faith disputes that there was an underpayment, the parties will review the books and records in a cooperative manner in an attempt to resolve any discrepancy. 
 B. If an examination or audit discloses an understatement of payments due to Licensor of five percent (5 or more for the period being examined or audited, or if the examination or audit reveals that the accounting procedures are insufficient to determine the accuracy of the calculation of any payments due, Licensee will reimburse Licensor for all reasonable costs and expenses connected with the examination or audit (including reasonable accounting and lawyers fees). If the examination or audit establishes a pattern of underreporting, Licensor may require that the financial reports due under Section 15.2 be audited by an internationally recognized independent accounting firm consented to by Licensor. The foregoing remedies are in addition to any other remedies that Licensor may have under this Agreement. 
 C. If an examination or audit reveals that Licensee has made overpayments to Licensor or any of its Affiliates, Licensor or such Affiliate will promptly pay to Licensee upon demand the amount overpaid. If Licensor does not pay Licensee the overpaid amount within thirty (30) days after receiving documentation evidencing such overpayment reasonably requested by Licensor, Licensor will also pay interest on the overpaid amount which will accrue thereon at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate from the thirtieth (30th) day following Licensor s receipt of such documentation until paid. 
 D.

 C. If either party receives notice of any action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand, inquiry, or investigation for which it is entitled to an indemnity under Sections 16.1.A or B, the party receiving notice shall promptly notify the other party. 
 D. Unless the parties otherwise agree, within 30 days after an indemnifying party receives notice of a third-party claim in accordance with Section 16.1.C, the indemnifying party will defend the third-party claim (and, unless the indemnifying party has specified any reservations or exceptions, seek to settle or compromise), at its expense and with its counsel. The indemnitee may, at its expense, employ separate counsel and participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement of the third- party claim. However, the indemnifying party will pay the fees and expenses of the indemnitee s counsel (a) for any period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense of the third-party claim (other than for any period in which the indemnitee did not notify the indemnitee of the third-party claim as required by Section 16.1.C) or (b) if the engagement of counsel is as a result of a conflict of interest, as the indemnitee reasonably determines in good faith. Notwithstanding the above, if Licensor determines that the matter at issue may have a material adverse effect on Licensor, the Licensed Marks, or Licensor s Lodging Business, then Licensor, through counsel of its choice, may control the defense or response to any such action, and such undertaking by Licensor will not, in any manner or form, diminish Licensor s 
 60 
 909953-1 

obligations to Licensee hereunder. If the matter at issue principally relates to Licensee s interest in the Licensed Business, Licensor shall allow Licensee through counsel of its choice to control the defense or response to any such action. 
 E. Under no circumstances will any indemnitee be required or obligated to seek recovery from third parties or otherwise mitigate its losses in order to maintain a claim for indemnification under this Agreement, and the failure to pursue such recovery or mitigate a loss will in no way reduce the amounts recoverable from the indemnifying party by the indemnitee. 
 F. The remedies provided in this Section 16.1 are cumulative and do not preclude assertion by any indemnitee of any other rights or the seeking of any and all other remedies against any indemnifying party. 
 G.

For the avoidance of doubt, (a) a failure by Licensor to (i) inspect or note in any inspection a deficiency or non- compliance with Brand Standards by Licensee or its Affiliate or (ii) enforce compliance with any Brand Standard by Licensee or its Affiliate or (b) any approval by Licensor of conduct or actions of Licensee or its Affiliate, shall not be deemed a breach that would limit or otherwise affect Licensee s obligation to indemnify Licensor. 
 (2) Except as may expressly be set forth in this Agreement, none of Licensor or its Affiliates or Licensee or its Affiliates will in any event have any liability to the other (including the obligation to indemnify the other party under this Section 16.1), or to any other Licensor indemnitee or Licensee indemnitee, as applicable, under this Agreement (a) for claims where either party or their Affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees or agents are found to be solely responsible by a final non- appealable judicial decision for such damages or losses based upon such person s or entity s willful misconduct or gross negligence or (b) for any indirect, punitive or consequential damages (other than to the extent the indemnitee is liable for such damages under a court order issued in connection with a claim). 
 H. The parties obligations under this Section 16.1 will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 63 
 909953-1 

16.5 Contribution.

The amount contributed by the indemnifying party will be in such proportion as reflects the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnitee in connection with the actions or omissions resulting in the liability and any other relevant equitable considerations. 
 B. The parties agree that any method of allocation of contribution under this Section 16.5 will take into account the equitable considerations referred to in Section 16.5.A.

No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act of 1933) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 
 
 17. TRANSFERABILITY OF INTERESTS 
 17.1 Transfers by Licensee. 
 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Licensee may not assign this Agreement or assign or sublicense any of its rights hereunder, or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement, or sell, transfer or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets relating to the Licensed Business, or merge or consolidate with any other entity in which Licensee is not the surviving entity, or engage in a transaction or series of related transactions that result in a Change in Control without Licensor s prior written consent which it may grant or withhold in its sole discretion. Any such Transfer will be a material default under this Agreement, and Licensor shall be entitled to enjoin or obtain a court order prohibiting such Transfer without posting a bond. Licensee shall not make any Transfer to a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person provided, however, that so long as the Ownership Interests in Licensee are publicly-traded on a U.S., nationally-recognized securities exchange, the purchase of publicly-traded Ownership Interests in Licensee by a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person shall not be deemed to be a violation of this sentence. If a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person acquires a Controlling Interest in Licensee, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to Licensee. 
 17.2 Transfers by Licensor. 
 A. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Licensor may not assign this Agreement or assign any of its rights hereunder, or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement provided, however, that Licensor may Transfer this Agreement to any Person without prior notice to, or consent of, Licensee, provided such Person (a) assumes Licensor s obligations to Licensee under this Agreement and (b) (i) is an Affiliate of Licensor that has the legal, financial, and operational ability to perform the obligations of Licensor under this Agreement or (ii) acquires all or substantially all of Licensor s rights in respect of (a) the System, (b) Specified Licensed Brand Hotels, and (c) the Branded Elements. This Agreement will be binding on and inure to the benefit of Licensor and the successors and assigns of Licensor. If, in connection with such acquisition of the rights in respect of the System and the Transfer of this Agreement Licensor retains ownership or control of any of the underlying assets of the System necessary to perform Licensor s obligations under this Agreement, Licensor will continue to provide to Licensee, or to the Person assuming this Agreement, access to such underlying assets as is necessary to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If, in connection with such acquisition of the rights in respect of the System and the Transfer of this Agreement, the components of the Branded Elements that 
 64 
 909953-1 

are used in Specified Licensed Brand Hotels are replaced with different or modified components by the Person assuming this Agreement, then, as a condition of such acquisition, such Person will be required to provide Licensee with access to such different or modified components that are comparable to the corresponding components of the Branded Elements. Licensor shall not make any Transfer to a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person provided, however, that so long as the Ownership Interests in Licensor are publicly-traded on a U.S., nationally-recognized securities exchange, the purchase of publicly- traded Ownership Interests in Licensor by a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person shall not be deemed to be a violation of this sentence. If a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person acquires a Controlling Interest in Licensor, Licensee shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to Licensor. 
 B. Licensee acknowledges that Licensor and its Affiliates operate as a multi-national business enterprise. Without limiting Section 17.2.A, Licensor has the right to Transfer all or part of its rights under this Agreement to any of Licensor s Affiliates and, in connection therewith, require Licensee to pay amounts due under this Agreement to such Affiliates. However, if, as a result of any such Transfer, Licensee will be liable for greater Tax liability for payments due hereunder following such Transfer, any resulting increase in Tax liability shall be borne by Licensor and not by Licensee. 
 17.3 Proposed Transfers to Lodging Competitors. 
 Without limiting Section 17.1, no Transfer of any Ownership Interest in Licensee, any Projects, the Licensed Business or any Transaction Agreement will be made to a Lodging Competitor that results in a Lodging Competitor obtaining Control of Licensee, the Projects, or the Licensed Business. Any such Transfer will be a material default under this Agreement, and Licensor shall be entitled to enjoin or obtain a court order prohibiting such Transfer without posting a bond. 
 17.4 Comfort Letter and Security Interests in This Agreement. 
 In connection with any financing benefiting the Licensed Business, Licensee may not assign, mortgage, or grant a security interest in, or pledge as collateral, this Agreement, except as permitted hereunder. At Licensee s request, Licensor hereby agrees to provide to Licensee s lender a comfort letter that is substantially similar to the form of comfort letter that has been agreed to by the parties as of the Original Effective Date, so long as such lender is not an Affiliate of Licensee and Licensee is not in breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement. However, Licensor has no obligation to provide a comfort letter in connection with, or consent to, a transaction that would be prohibited by this Section 17. If a lender forecloses on, or otherwise exercises its rights against the assets of the Licensed Business, the revenues of the Licensed Business, or such Ownership Interests in Licensee, or Licensee violates this Section 17, Licensor will have the rights under Section 18.1. Licensor has no obligation to license a lender or any Person acting on behalf of a lender, including a receiver or servicer of a loan, to use the Licensed Marks or the System, unless that obligation arises from a valid and binding written agreement between Licensor and a lender. 
 
 18. BREACH, DEFAULT, AND REMEDIES 
 18.1 Licensee Project-, Sales Facility-, and Member Service Center-Level Breaches, Defaults, and Remedies. 
 A. The Project-, Sales Facility-, and Member Service Center-level breaches listed in (i) through (viii) below are deemed to be material breaches for which Licensee may be placed in default with respect to any Project, Sales Facility, or Member Service Center, as applicable, hereunder if (x) Licensor gives Licensee notice of the breach that provides the applicable cure period for the applicable 
 65 
 909953-1

 (b) If an arbitration panel under Section 22.4 determines that (i) a material breach has occurred, (ii) (x) Licensor has failed to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such breach or (y) such breach was intentional or resulted from Licensor s gross negligence, and (iii) such breach has or may result in the goodwill associated with the Licensed Business being so materially damaged as a result of the breach that interim injunctive relief is an inadequate remedy and that termination of the entire relationship contemplated by this Agreement is the only adequate remedy, then upon the rendering of arbitration panel s determination Licensee may issue a notice of default to Licensor and terminate this Agreement and or exercise any of the other remedies under Section 18.3.B. 
 (v) If a Transfer by Licensor occurs in violation of Section 17.2, Licensee may issue a notice of breach. If Licensor fails to notify Licensee within fourteen (14) days following the notice of breach that Licensor intends to unwind such Transfer or fails to actually unwind such Transfer in a manner satisfactory to Licensee within ninety (90) days following the notice of breach, then Licensee may issue a notice of default and terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to Licensor and or exercise any of the other remedies under Section 18.3.B provided, however, that nothing herein shall restrict or limit Licensee s ability to seek injunctive relief to stop such Transfer at any time

 (viii) (a) If Licensor or any of its Affiliates is convicted of a felony or other similar crime or offense and such conviction prevents Licensee from obtaining or retaining the licenses that it requires to continue operating the Licensed Business at any individual Project(s), then Licensee may issue a notice of breach and exercise any of the remedies under Section 18.3.B 
 (b) If Licensor or any of its Affiliates is convicted of a felony or other similar crime or offense and such conviction is the actual and sole cause of Licensee being prevented from obtaining or retaining the licenses that it requires to continue operating the Licensed Business at all or substantially all of the Projects and the Licensed Business is so materially damaged that termination of the entire relationship contemplated by this Agreement is the only adequate remedy, then Licensee may issue a notice of breach. Upon such notice of breach, the parties will agree to a Remediation Arrangement under which Licensor will undertake to remedy the breach to Licensee s satisfaction. If Licensor fails to enter into a Remediation Arrangement within ninety (90) days following the date of the notice of breach or fails to cure the breach pursuant to the Remediation Arrangement, Licensee may issue a notice of default and terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to Licensor and or exercise any of the other remedies under Section 18.3.B.

 A.

receipt by respondent of a copy of the demand for arbitration. For purposes of this Section 22.4, Licensor and its Affiliates, on one hand, and Licensee and its Affiliates, on the other hand, will each be deemed to be one (1) party. The two (2) party-appointed arbitrators will have twenty (20) days from the appointment of the second (2nd) arbitrator to agree on a third (3rd) arbitrator who will chair the arbitral tribunal.

 C. Any Dispute to be settled by arbitration under this Section 22.4 will at the request of Licensor or Licensee be resolved in a single arbitration before a single tribunal together with any Dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other agreement (including any other Transaction Agreements) between or among Licensee, Guarantor and their respective Affiliates on the one hand and Licensor or its Affiliates on the other. If there are multiple claimants and or multiple respondents to the effect that there are more than two (2) parties to the arbitration, all claimants and or all respondents will attempt to agree upon their respective appointments. If such multiple parties fail to nominate an arbitrator within thirty (30) days, the AAA will appoint an arbitrator on their behalf. In such circumstances, any existing nomination of the arbitrator chosen by the party or parties on the other side of the proposed arbitration will be unaffected, and the remaining arbitrators will be appointed in accordance with AAA Rules R. 12 and R. 13. 
 D. Any controversy concerning whether a Dispute is an arbitrable Dispute, whether arbitration has been waived, whether an assignee of this Agreement is bound to arbitrate, or as to the interpretation or enforceability of this Section 22.4 will be determined by the arbitrators. 
 E. The decision of the arbitral tribunal will be final and binding upon the parties, and such decision will be enforceable through any courts having jurisdiction. The arbitral tribunal will have no authority to amend or modify the terms of this Agreement. The arbitral tribunal may award or include in their award any relief they deem proper in the circumstances, including money damages (with Interest on unpaid amounts from the date due), specific performance and legal fees and costs in accordance with this Agreement however, the arbitral tribunal may not award special, punitive, consequential or exemplary damages. The costs and expenses of arbitration will be allocated and paid by the parties as determined by the arbitral tribunal. The arbitral tribunal will have the authority to make such orders granting interim or provisional relief during the pendency of the arbitration as it deems just and equitable. Any such order will be without prejudice to the final determination of the controversy. 
 F. The parties will use their reasonable best efforts to encourage the arbitrators to resolve any arbitration related to any Dispute as promptly as practicable. Subject to Applicable Law, including disclosure or reporting requirements, or the parties agreement, the parties will maintain the confidentiality of the arbitration. Unless agreed to by all the parties or required by Applicable Law, including disclosure or reporting requirements, the arbitrators and the parties will maintain the confidentiality of all information, records, reports, or other documents obtained in the course of the arbitration, and of all awards, orders, or other arbitral decisions rendered by the arbitrators. 
 G. Any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement will be conducted on an individual (not a class-wide) basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration proceedings to which Licensor is a party, except as specified below. No decision on any matter in any other arbitration proceeding in which Licensor is a party will prevent any party to the arbitration proceeding from submitting evidence with respect to the same or a similar matter or prevent the arbitral tribunal from rendering an independent decision without regard to such decision in such other arbitration proceeding.

 Marriott Milestones, Approvals & Phases 
 Our brands provide our guests with value and experience beyond expectation. We developed this process as a critical tool to illustrate the road map of checks and balances required in development on a wide range of scales, from conversions and renovations to new builds. 
 This document is a key document. As you progress through the design process , we periodically review the work. Our goal is to identify challenges early, so they can be fixed quickly and efficiently. 
 This document spells out the expected design submittals, and what items are to be included in each submittal. We've changed our submittal process to virtually eliminate paper and to handle most reviews electronically. We'll still need f abric and finish samples, but not printed drawings or specification books. At the beginning of each project, the Process is customized according to the project scope and phasing. 
 This document outlines the project management and reporting requirements as well as project closeout and opening requirements.

 ID-1- Design Narrative 
 Purpose 
 The Licensee's Design Consultants develop a Design Narrative serving as the experiential brief for the property and informing the Project 's holistic design. A Design Narrative will be based upon the brand DNA and exists to ensure each Project is connected to the global portfolio through the consistent manifestation of the brand's core values. This ultimately brings strategic diversity to the portfolio, delineation amongst competitor brands, as well as further establishing brand affinity with new and existing guests around the world.

Marriott Milestones, Approvals & Phases 
 Our brands provide our guests with value and experience beyond expectation. We developed this process as a critical tool to illustrate the road map of checks and balances required in development for renovations. 
 This document is a key document. As you progress through the design process, we periodically review the work. Our goal is to identify challenges early, so they can be fixed quickly and efficiently. 
 This document spells out the expected design submittals, and what items are to be included in each submittal. We've changed our submittal process to virtually eliminate paper and to handle most reviews electronically. We'll still need fabric and finish samples, but not printed drawings or specification books. At the beginning of each project, the Process is customized according to the project scope and phasing. 
 This document outlines the project management and reporting requirements as well as project closeout.
