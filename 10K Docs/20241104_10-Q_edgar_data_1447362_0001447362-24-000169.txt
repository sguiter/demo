 We have a history of recurring net losses and negative cash flows and as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of million. We believe our million of cash and cash equivalents and million of marketable investment securities as of September 30, 2024, and anticipated revenue from our test reports, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the 12-month period following the date that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. 
 Unaudited Interim Financial Information 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024; the condensed consolidated statements of operations, the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and the condensed consolidated statements of stockholders equity, each for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are unaudited. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of our consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024, the results of our consolidated operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and our consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes related to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are also unaudited. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, any other interim periods, or any future year or period. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. Certain disclosures have been condensed or omitted from the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 28, 2024 (the 2023 10-K ).

 . Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. Our leasehold improvements primarily relate to our office and laboratory facilities in Friendswood, Texas, Phoenix, Arizona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and are generally being depreciated through the end of the lease terms in 2025 and 2033, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and material improvements are capitalized. Interest costs incurred during the construction of major capital projects are capitalized until the underlying asset is ready for its intended use, at which

 million and million, respectively, for liabilities associated with these bonus plans. These amounts are classified as current or noncurrent accrued liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets based on the expected timing of payment. 
 Stock-Based Compensation). PSUs vest upon the achievement of certain performance conditions and the provision of service with us through a specified period. Accruals of compensation cost for PSUs are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions and are reassessed each reporting period. We recognize compensation cost for PSUs separately for each vesting tranche on a ratable basis over the requisite service period. The requisite service period for PSUs is based on an analysis of vesting requirements and performance conditions for the particular award. Certain employees are entitled to acceleration of vesting of a portion of their awards upon retirement, subject to age, service and notice requirements. In these cases, the requisite service period takes into consideration the employee s retirement eligibility, and is reassessed at each reporting date. For the ESPP, the requisite service period is generally the period of time from the offering date to the purchase date. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.

 days from receipt. Medicare claims that were either submitted to Medicare prior to the local coverage determination or other coverage commencement date or are not covered but meet the definition of being medically reasonable and necessary pursuant to the controlling Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act are generally appealed and may ultimately be paid at the first (termed redetermination ), second (termed reconsideration or third level of appeal de novo hearing with an Administrative Law Judge). A successful appeal at any of these levels may result in prompt payment. 
 In the absence of Medicare coverage, contractually established reimbursements rates or other coverage, we have concluded that our contracts include variable consideration because the amounts paid by Medicare or commercial health insurance carriers may be paid at less than our standard rates or not paid at all, with such differences considered implicit price concessions. Variable consideration attributable to these price concessions is measured at

Included in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million and million of net negative revenue adjustments, respectively, associated with changes in estimated variable consideration. These amounts include (i) adjustments for actual collections versus estimated amounts and (ii) cash collections and the related recognition of revenue in current period for tests delivered in prior periods due to the release of the constraint on variable consideration. 
 Because our contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, we have elected the practical expedient in ASC 606 to not disclose information about our remaining performance obligations. Any incremental costs to obtain contracts are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred due to the short duration of our contracts.

 Although available to be sold to meet operating needs or otherwise, securities are generally held through maturity. We classify all investments as current assets, as these are readily available for use in current operations. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method for purposes of recording gains and losses. 
 There were realized gains or losses on sales of investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 We evaluated our investment portfolio under the available-for-sale debt securities impairment model guidance and determined our investment portfolio is comprised of low-risk, investment grade securities. As of September 30, 2024, unrealized losses on our available-for-sale investments are not attributed to credit risk. We believe that an allowance for credit losses is unnecessary because the unrealized losses on certain of our marketable investment securities are due to market factors. credit-related or noncredit-related impairment losses were recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The allowance for credit losses was as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, all of our available-for-sale debt securities had contractual maturities of one year or less.

 The obligations under the 2024 LSA are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property, the real property held by us, and are subject to certain other exceptions and limitations.

As of September 30, 2024, we had no remaining credits for leasehold improvements under this contract. In our remeasurement, we recognized an additional million in operating lease assets in exchange for an equal amount of additional lease liabilities.

 Contingent Consideration 
 In connection with our acquisition of AltheaDx, we agreed to pay contingent consideration of up to million of commercial milestone payments based on the achievement of certain net revenue targets relating to the years ending December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 AltheaDx Earnout Payments ). The portion of the AltheaDx Earnout Payments associated with the commercial milestones for the year ended December 31, 2023 was million and was not paid since the applicable commercial milestones were not met. The AltheaDx Earnout Payments included a 2022 catch-up provision for additional payment of up to million that expired in 2023. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, we have a potential payment obligation of up to million with respect to the remaining commercial milestones for 2024. If the settlement of the remaining portion of the AltheaDx Earnout Payments would have occurred on September 30, 2024, amounts would have been due because no commercial milestones had been achieved as of such date. 
 The contingent consideration was classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs and a Monte Carlo simulation to determine its fair value. The Monte Carlo simulation uses projections of the commercial milestones for the applicable period as well as the corresponding targets and approximate timing of payment based on the terms of the arrangement. The valuation of the AltheaDx contingent consideration was as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and gains or losses were recorded associated with changes in fair value during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The contingent consideration liability is remeasured at fair value at each reporting period taking into account any updated assumptions or changes in circumstances. Any changes in the fair value are recorded as gains or losses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.

 In January 2023, our board of directors approved a retirement policy (the Retirement Policy that provides for acceleration of a portion of unvested awards that were granted to certain eligible employees upon meeting age, service and notice requirements. We considered the adoption of the Retirement Policy to be a modification of existing awards under ASC Topic 718 , Compensation Stock Compensation . The modification did not result in any incremental compensation cost. However, the adoption of the policy resulted in a new estimate of the requisite service period for certain awards, which we reassess at each balance sheet date. In connection with the Retirement Policy, we accelerated the recognition of compensation expense of million and million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and accelerated the recognition of compensation expense of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Overview 
 Castle Biosciences is a molecular diagnostics company offering innovative test solutions to aid clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of dermatologic cancers, Barrett s esophagus BE ), uveal melanoma UM ), and in the treatment of mental health conditions. 
 Our Test Portfolio 
 We currently offer five commercially available proprietary multi-analyte assays with algorithmic analysis MAAA tests for use in the dermatologic, gastroenterology and ocular fields. We also offer a proprietary pharmacogenomics PGx test to guide optimal drug treatment for patients diagnosed with depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions. 
 Currently, our revenue is primarily generated by our DecisionDx-Melanoma risk stratification test for cutaneous melanoma CM ), which is supplemented by revenue generated from our DecisionDx-SCC risk stratification test for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma SCC ), our TissueCypher risk stratification test for BE and our DecisionDx-UM risk stratification test for UM. 
 All five of our MAAA tests have been granted Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Test ADLT status by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS which means each test has demonstrated that (i) when combined with an empirically derived algorithm, it yields a result that predicts the probability a specific individual patient will develop a certain condition or conditions, or will respond to a particular therapy or therapies; and (ii) it provides new clinical diagnostic information that cannot be obtained from any other test or combination of tests. We believe this designation not only demonstrates our focus on developing and validating innovative tests but also enables our Medicare reimbursement rate to be set, over the long term, by the median private payor rate, which we believe provides a fair exchange of value. Further information about Medicare coverage and ADLT status with respect to each of our tests is set forth below. 
 
 Test Overview 
 Our Dermatologic Tests 
 DecisionDx-Melanoma is our proprietary risk stratification gene expression profile GEP test that is designed to predict the risk of metastasis or recurrence for patients diagnosed with invasive CM. In a typical year, we estimate approximately 130,000 patients are diagnosed with invasive CM in the United States, representing an estimated 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 U.S. total addressable market TAM of approximately 540 million. We estimate that approximately 50 of patients diagnosed with CM are 65 years of age or older. 
 DecisionDx SCC is our proprietary GEP test for use in patients with SCC, with one or more risk factors (also referred to as high-risk SCC). We estimate that 20 of SCC patients, or 200,000 annually in the United States, are classified as high risk, representing an estimated U.S. TAM of approximately 820 million. 
 MyPath Melanoma is our proprietary GEP test for use in patients with a melanocytic lesion and uncertainty related to the malignancy of the lesion. We estimate approximately 300,000 patients each year present with a diagnostically ambiguous lesion, representing an estimated U.S. TAM of approximately 600 million. We began offering MyPath Melanoma following our acquisition of the Myriad MyPath Laboratory in May 2021 at which point we offered both our MyPath Melanoma test and our DiffDx-Melanoma test under an offering that we referred to as our Diagnostic GEP offering. However, following an internal assessment of the clinical value of offering both tests, we made the decision to suspend the clinical offering of DiffDx-Melanoma in February 2023 and now the focus of this offering is MyPath Melanoma. 
 Our Gastroenterology Test 
 TissueCypher is our proprietary risk stratification spatial omics test designed to predict future development of high-grade dysplasia and/or esophageal cancer in patients with non-dysplastic, indefinite dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia BE. We estimate a U.S. TAM of approximately 1 billion. 
 Our Uveal Melanoma Test 
 DecisionDx-UM is a proprietary, risk stratification GEP test that is designed to predict the risk of metastasis for patients with UM. We believe DecisionDx-UM is the standard of care in the management of newly diagnosed UM in the majority of ocular oncology practices in the United States. We estimate a U.S. TAM of approximately 10 million. 
 Our Mental Health Test 
 IDgenetix is a PGx test that guides personalized mental health medication selection and management for patients with depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions. We estimate a U.S. TAM of approximately 5 billion. 
 
 Commercial Expansion Efforts 
 In September 2022, we established a new commercial sales team dedicated to our Diagnostic GEP offering and added additional outside territories for our TissueCypher test, which were fully integrated into our commercial operations by the end of the second quarter of 2023. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, we continued to expand our dermatologic and gastrointestinal commercial sales forces through territory and headcount expansions with focus being on our DecisionDx-Melanoma, DecisionDx-SCC, and TissueCypher tests. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we further expanded our sales and marketing team for our TissueCypher test. We will continue to assess market response in determining further commercial expansions and commercial team structure. 
 
 Reimbursement 
 The primary source of revenue for our products is reimbursement from third-party payors, which includes government payors, such as Medicare, and commercial payors, such as insurance companies. Achieving broad coverage and reimbursement of our current products by third-party payors and continued Medicare coverage are key components of our financial success. 
 We bill third-party payors and patients for the tests we perform. We have received Medicare coverage for our DecisionDx-Melanoma, DecisionDx-SCC, MyPath Melanoma, DecisionDx-UM, TissueCypher and IDgenetix tests which meet certain criteria for Medicare and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. 
 The Medicare rates discussed below are prior to giving effect to applicable sequestration in effect from time to time as described in further detail under Government Regulation and Product Approval Healthcare Reform included in Item 1, Business, of the 2023 10-K.

 DecisionDx-Melanoma 
 DecisionDx-Melanoma tests are processed from our Phoenix laboratory and since the second quarter of 2022, have been covered under foundational local coverage determinations LCD finalized by Medicare Administrative Contractors MACs Palmetto GBA MolDX Palmetto and Noridian Health Solutions Noridian ). 
 DecisionDx-Melanoma has met ADLT status, as determined by the CMS, since 2019. Since 2022, the rate for DecisionDx-Melanoma is set annually based upon the median private payor rate for the first half of the second preceding calendar year. For example, the rate for 2023 was set using median private payor rate data from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021. Our rate for 2023 was 7,193 per test and is 7,193 for 2024. 
 DecisionDx-UM 
 DecisionDx-UM tests are processed from our Phoenix laboratory and are covered under LCDs finalized by MAC administrators Palmetto and Noridian in July 2017. 
 DecisionDx-UM has met the criteria of existing advanced diagnostic laboratory test status, also referred to as existing ADLT status, as determined by the CMS, since May 2019. Our rate is set annually based upon the median private payor rate for the first half of the second preceding calendar year. For example, the rate for 2023 was set using median private payor rate data from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021. Our rate for 2023 was 7,776 per test and is 7,776 for 2024. 
 MyPath Melanoma and DiffDx-Melanoma 
 MyPath Melanoma was covered under a test-specific LCD policy through Noridian that became effective in June 2019. Effective August 6, 2023, Palmetto and Noridian issued LCDs that converted the test-specific MyPath Melanoma LCD to a foundational LCD and provided coverage for both MyPath Melanoma and DiffDx-Melanoma. 
 MyPath Melanoma was approved as a new ADLT in September 2019. The rate for our MyPath Melanoma test is set annually based upon the median private payor rate for the first half of the second preceding calendar year. Our 2023 rate was set at 1,755 per test, based on data submitted by the predecessor owner of the Myriad MyPath Laboratory relating to the first half of 2021. Our 2024 rate is set at 1,950 per test. 
 In the second quarter of 2022, we obtained a Proprietary Laboratory Analyses PLA code for DiffDx-Melanoma. In 2023, DiffDx-Melanoma went through the CMS gapfill process which concluded in September 2023 with CMS posting a final MAC-specific gapfill rate of 1,950 per test. Our rate for 2024 is 1,950 per test. 
 Diagnostic GEP Offering 
 Our Diagnostic GEP offering included MyPath Melanoma and DiffDx-Melanoma. We began offering MyPath Melanoma following our acquisition of the Myriad MyPath Laboratory on May 28, 2021. Our internal data indicates that we have improved the technical performance of MyPath Melanoma and that it is comparable to the technical performance of DiffDx-Melanoma. As such, following an internal assessment of the clinical value of offering both tests, we made the decision to suspend the clinical offering of DiffDx-Melanoma in February 2023. 
 DecisionDx SCC 
 We issue our DecisionDx-SCC tests from our Pittsburgh and Phoenix labs, with a majority of tests being issued from our Pittsburgh lab. 
 On June 2, 2023, Novitas Solutions Novitas ), the MAC responsible for administering claims for test reports issued by our Pittsburgh laboratory, posted a finalized oncology biomarker LCD pursuant to which the DecisionDx-SCC test would no longer be covered by Medicare effective July 17, 2023. However, on July 6, 2023, Novitas suspended the final version of the LCD and announced its intent to post a new proposed LCD for comment and presentation at an open meeting. On July 27, 2023, Novitas posted a nearly identical proposed oncology biomarker LCD that continues to intend to rely upon evidentiary reviews sourced from three databases: ClinGen, OncoKB and NCCN. The proposed LCD also recommends non-coverage for our DecisionDx-SCC test. The comment period for the proposed LCD ended on September 9, 2023. On July 26, 2024, Novitas posted a note that it had been granted an extension by CMS. We cannot predict whether this LCD will be finalized as proposed or what the timing of any final LCD might be. 
 Palmetto s MolDX program oversees MAAA tests that are reported from our Phoenix laboratory and Noridian is the MAC responsible for administering claims for test reports issued by our Phoenix laboratory. On June 8, 2023, both Palmetto and Noridian posted a preliminary draft LCD recommending no coverage for DecisionDx-SCC. The comment period for the draft LCDs ended on July 22, 2023. On July 4, 2024, the LCD was finalized as proposed with a future effective date of August 18, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 DecisionDx-SCC was reimbursed at a rate of 3,873 per test under a PLA code from second quarter of 2022 through June 30, 2023 when CMS determined DecisionDx-SCC meets the criteria for new ADLT status. Effective July 1, 2023 and through March 31, 2024, CMS set the initial period rate equal to the list price of 8,500 per test. Effective April 1, 2024 and through December 31, 2025, the published CLFS rate for DecisionDx-SCC will be based on the median private payor rates received between July 1, 2023 and November 30, 2023. We submitted the median private payor data to CMS during the data reporting period in December 2023. Effective April 1, 2024, the updated CLFS rate will continue at 8,500 through December 31, 2025. Future rates will be set annually based upon the median private payor rate for the first half of the second preceding calendar year. ADLT status determines the process by which the rate is set and is not an indication of Medicare coverage. 
 TissueCypher 
 TissueCypher is processed in our Pittsburgh laboratory and falls under the Medicare jurisdiction managed by Novitas. 
 On March 24, 2022, CMS determined that TissueCypher meets the criteria for new ADLT status. ADLT status exempts TissueCypher from what is called the 14-day rule, which simplifies the billing process for Medicare patients. Effective January 1, 2023, the published CLFS rate for TissueCypher was set at 4,950 per test, which will remain effective through December 31, 2024. This rate is based on the median private payor rates received between April 1, 2022 and August 31, 2022. Thereafter, the rate will be set annually based upon the median private payor rate for the first half of the second preceding calendar year. 
 IDgenetix 
 IDgenetix is currently covered under a Noridian LCD policy and accompanying billing and coding article developed by MolDX. 
 Our IDgenetix multi-gene panel was reimbursed by Medicare at approximately 1,500 per test from April 2022 through February 2023, when MolDX notified us that as part of its annual CPT code updates, IDgenetix should shift billing to a different generic gene sequencing CPT code (the New CPT Code and continue using the IDgenetix Z-Code beginning in March 2023. The New CPT Code was set at 917 per test while the test went through CMS s Gapfill pricing process. We believed the new CPT Code, in conjunction with the IDgenetix Z-Code, did not describe all of the components of the IDgenetix test and thus, was not appropriate for IDgenetix. We subsequently obtained a test-specific PLA CPT code which became effective October 1, 2023. In November 2023, CMS posted its final CLFS determination which crosswalks our PLA CPT code to an existing PLA code at a rate of 1,336 per test effective January 1, 2024. 
 
 Government Regulation and Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests 
 On April 29, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA published a final rule on the regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests LDTs which amends the FDA's regulations to make explicit that LDT's are devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act FD C Act ). The FDA issued a policy to phase out, over the course of four years, its general enforcement discretion approach to LDTs and also issued targeted enforcement discretion policies for certain categories of LDTs. The FDA is continuing enforcement discretion for currently marketed tests offered as LDTs (that were first marketed before May 6, 2024) that are approved by the New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program NYS CLEP ). Our proprietary tests, outlined above, are all NYS CLEP approved. We believe this final ruling will have no material impact on our existing test offerings given all of our tests were marketed before May 6, 2024. 
 
 Delivered Test Reports 
 The number of test reports we deliver is a key indicator that we use to assess our business. A test report is generated when we receive a sample in our laboratory, and then the relevant test information is entered into our Laboratory Information Management System, the laboratory portion of the test is performed, including proprietary algorithmic analysis of the combined biomarkers, and a report is then generated which is delivered to the clinician who ordered the test.

 (1) Includes MyPath Melanoma and DiffDx-Melanoma. We offered both MyPath Melanoma and DiffDx-Melanoma under our Diagnostic GEP offering until February 2023 when we suspended the offering of DiffDx-Melanoma, as discussed above. 
 (2) We temporarily paused accepting additional orders in July 2023, resumed accepting new orders in a phased approach in September 2023, and completed processing of our pre-existing backlog orders in October 2023. We have continued accepting new orders since September 2023. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our test report volume increased by 41.3 and 43.6 , respectively, compared to the same period in 2023. Our dermatologic test report volume increased by 17 and 19.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have experienced higher test report volumes for all of our tests compared to the prior period in 2023. For a discussion of how we recognize revenue derived from our tests, refer to Components of Results of Operations Net Revenues below. 
 In August 2024, we amended our Pittsburgh commercial real estate lease to add 23,821 square feet to our existing facilities, most of which will be used as dedicated lab space for processing our TissueCypher test. As of September 30, 2024, substantially all leasehold improvements for this added space were complete and the added lab space was ready for use. We expect the additional space will allow us to continue developing our business through our TissueCypher product line. 
 For our DecisionDx-SCC product line, we continue to see opportunities for leverage, where many of the clinicians ordering our DecisionDx-Melanoma are the same clinicians who order our DecisionDx-SCC test. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 75 of all clinicians ordering DecisionDx-SCC had also ordered our DecisionDx-Melanoma test during that same period. 
 
 Information About Certain Metrics 
 The following provides additional information about certain metrics we have disclosed in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Test Reports Delivered 
 Test reports delivered represent the number of completed test reports delivered by us during the reporting period indicated. The period in which a test report is delivered does not necessarily correspond with the period in which the related revenue, if any, is recognized, due to the timing and amount of adjustments for variable consideration under Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). We

 use this metric to evaluate the growth in adoption of our tests and to measure against our internal performance objectives. We believe this metric is useful to investors in evaluating the volume of our business activity from period-to-period that may not be discernible from our reported revenues under ASC 606.

 Macroeconomic conditions, including uncertainties associated with the Israel-Hamas war, the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the U.S. presidential election, economic slowdowns, public health crises, labor shortages, recessions or market corrections, supply chain disruptions, inflation and monetary policy shifts, liquidity concerns at, and failures of, banks and other financial institutions or other disruptions in the banking system or financing markets, changes to interest rates and financial and credit market fluctuations, volatility in the capital markets and other evolving macroeconomic developments, continue to have direct and indirect impacts on our business and could in the future materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. We continue to actively monitor the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The extent of the impact of these factors on our operational performance and financial condition, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected timeframe, will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted; however, any continued or renewed disruption resulting from these factors could negatively impact our business. 
 
 Our Financial Results 
 Our net income may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of our planned development activities, the growth of our sales and marketing activities and the timing of revenue recognition under ASC 606. We expect our expenses will increase substantially over time as we: 
 execute clinical studies to generate evidence supporting our current and future product candidates; 
 execute our commercialization strategy for our current and future commercial products; 
 continue our ongoing and planned development of new products in our pipeline; 
 seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; 
 hire additional scientific and research and development staff; and 
 add additional operational, financial and management information systems and personnel. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe there are several important factors that have impacted, and that we expect will continue to impact, our operating performance and results of operations, including: 
 Report volume. We believe that the number of reports we deliver to clinicians is an important indicator of the growth of adoption among the healthcare provider community. Our revenue and costs are affected by the volume of testing and mix of customers. Our performance depends on our ability to retain and broaden adoption with existing prescribing clinicians, as well as attract new clinicians. Our report volume could be negatively impacted by developments related to evolving macroeconomic developments, as discussed above. 
 Reimbursement. We believe that expanding reimbursement is an important indicator of the value of our products. Payors require extensive evidence of clinical utility, clinical validity, patient outcomes and health economic benefits in order to provide reimbursement for diagnostic products. Our revenue depends on our ability to demonstrate the value of our products to these payors. 
 Gross margin. We believe that our gross margin is an important indicator of the operating performance of our business. Higher gross margins reflect the average selling price of our tests, as well as the operating efficiency of our laboratory operations. 
 Expansion of our sales force and marketing programs. We believe the expansion of our direct sales force and marketing organization to educate clinicians and pathologists on the value of our molecular testing products will significantly impact our performance. 
 Integrating acquisitions. Revenue growth, operational results and advances to our business strategy depends on our ability to integrate any acquisitions into our existing business and effectively scale their operations. The integration of acquired assets may impact our revenue growth, increase the cost of

 operations or may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. 
 New product development. A significant aspect of our business is our investment in research and development activities, including activities related to the development of new products. In addition to the development of new product candidates, we believe these studies are critical to gaining clinician adoption of new products and driving favorable coverage decisions by payors for such products. 
 
 Components of the Results of Operations 
 Net Revenues 
 We generate revenues from the sale of our products. Currently, our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of DecisionDx-Melanoma, DecisionDx-SCC, TissueCypher and DecisionDx-UM. We bill third-party payors and patients for the tests we perform. 
 Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue at the amount we expect to be entitled, subject to a constraint for variable consideration, in the period in which our tests are delivered to the treating clinicians. We have determined that our contracts contain variable consideration under ASC 606 because the amounts paid by third-party payors may be paid at less than our standard rates or not paid at all, with such differences considered implicit price concessions. Variable consideration is recognized only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur in future periods when the uncertainties are resolved. Variable consideration is evaluated each reporting period and adjustments are recorded as increases or decreases in revenues. Variable consideration for Medicare claims that are not covered by Medicare, including those claims undergoing appeal, is deemed to be fully constrained due to factors outside our influence (e.g., judgment or actions of third parties) and the uncertainty of the amount to be received is not expected to be resolved for a long period of time. For these fully constrained claims, we generally recognize revenue in the period the uncertainty is favorably resolved, if at all. Due to potential future changes in Medicare coverage policies and appeal cycles, insurance coverage policies, contractual rates and other trends in the reimbursement of our tests, our revenues may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Our ability to recognize revenue for a test is dependent on the development of reimbursement experience and obtaining coverage decisions. For tests with limited reimbursement experience or no coverage, we recognize revenues on the basis of actual cash collections. 
 Our ability to increase our revenues will depend on our ability to further penetrate our target markets, and, in particular, generate sales through our direct sales force, maintain Medicare coverage for our currently marketed products, develop and commercialize additional tests, including through acquisitions, obtain reimbursement from additional third-party payors and increase our reimbursement rate for tests performed. 
 Cost of Sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) 
 The components of our cost of sales are material and service costs associated with testing samples, personnel costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense), electronic medical record set up costs, order and delivery systems, shipping charges to transport samples, third-party test fees, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology costs, equipment and facilities depreciation and utilities. Costs associated with testing samples are recorded when the test is processed regardless of whether and when revenues are recognized with respect to that test. As a result, our cost of sales as a percentage of revenues may vary significantly from period to period because we do not recognize all revenues in the period in which the associated costs are incurred. We expect cost of sales in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases. Additionally, we expect cost of sales to increase with the expansion of laboratory capacity and staffing in advance of the anticipated growth of our more recently launched tests and tests acquired through acquisitions. For example, we commenced operations in a newly expanded laboratory facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently amended the lease in August of 2024, adding 23,821 square feet to our existing facilities. 
 Gross margin and gross margin percentage are key indicators we use to assess our business. See the table in Results of Operations Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and Results of Operations Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for details. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses include costs incurred to develop our tests, collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products. These costs consist of personnel costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense), prototype materials, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, regulatory costs, electronic medical records set up costs, costs associated with setting up and

Table of Contents 

 conducting clinical studies and allocated overhead, including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing enhanced and new products. 
 We expect to use a portion of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable investment securities to further support and accelerate our research and development activities, including important studies that are underway to support our DecisionDx-Melanoma test. For instance, in February 2023, we announced the publication of data from the DECIDE study presenting DecisionDx-Melanoma test results influenced 85 of clinicians decisions regarding the SLNB surgical procedure. Additionally, use of the tests results within current guideline recommendations led to a significant reduction in SLNB procedures performed, demonstrating the clinical value of the test to guide risk-aligned patient care. Also, in 2021, we initiated our large prospective, multi-center clinical study to develop, validate and bring to market a pipeline genomic test, or tests, aimed at predicting response to systemic therapy in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and related inflammatory skin conditions. Since December 31, 2023, we continue to maintain active clinical study test sites and a consistent number of patients enrolled in this study. Assuming we are successful in validating a genomic test, or tests, for one or more of these uses, then we expect to launch this pipeline test by the end of 2025. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses include executive, selling and marketing, legal, finance and accounting, human resources and billing functions. These expenses consist of personnel costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense), direct marketing expenses, audit and legal expenses, consulting costs, payor outreach programs and allocated overhead, including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation, and utilities. Other administrative and professional services expenses within SG A are expected to increase with the scale of our business, but selling and marketing-related expenses are expected to increase significantly, consistent with our growth strategy. 
 Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of acquired intangible assets is primarily associated with developed technology obtained through acquisitions, such as our acquisitions of Cernostics in December 2021 and AltheaDx in April 2022. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists primarily of earnings on cash and cash equivalents, primarily money market funds, and marketable investment securities, primarily short-term U.S. government obligations. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense is primarily attributable to long-term debt and finance leases. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Revisions in our estimate of annual pre-tax income, relating to uncertainty in continued Medicare coverage for our DecisionDx-SCC test and updated information, are sources of variability in our effective tax rates from period to period. As of December 31, 2023, we had federal net operating loss NOL carryforwards of 197.1 million, of which 92.0 million will begin to expire in 2029 if not utilized to offset federal taxable income, and 105.1 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2023, we also had state NOL carryforwards of 114.3 million, which begin to expire in 2028 if not utilized to offset state taxable income.

 The following table presents the calculation of gross margin (in thousands, except percentages): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (unaudited) Net revenues 85,782 61,493 24,289 Less: Cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) 15,609 11,319 4,290 Less: Amortization of acquired intangible assets 2,272 2,272 Gross margin 67,901 47,902 19,999 Gross margin percentage 79.2 77.9 1.3 
 
 Net Revenues 
 Net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 24.3 million, or 39.5 , to 85.8 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 13.9 million increase in revenue from our dermatologic tests and a 10.4 million increase in revenue from our non-dermatologic tests. 
 The 13.9 million increase in net revenues for our Dermatologic tests was primarily attributable to our DecisionDx-SCC test, which was due to higher test report volumes and a higher realized average selling price ASP ), as well our DecisionDx-Melanoma test which had higher test report volumes though a slightly lower ASP. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, test report volumes for our DecisionDx-SCC and DecisionDx-Melanoma tests increased by 48.8 and 9.4 , respectively. Increases in realized ASP for our DecisionDx-SCC test were primarily attributable to an increase in our Medicare reimbursement rate for this test, beginning in July 2023. 
 The 10.4 million increase in net revenues from our non-dermatologic tests was largely attributable to a 114.7 increase in test report volumes for our TissueCypher test, and, to a lesser extent, to our IDgenetix test which also had higher test report volumes. Increases in our TissueCypher test report volumes reflect growth through our sales force efforts as well as the impacts of a temporary pause in accepting new orders from July 2023 through September 2023, during which time our lab operations team successfully implemented certain process improvements, automations, and operational enhancements for this test to support future growth. Net revenue from our non-dermatologic tests as a percentage of total net revenue increased from 16.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 24.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cost of Sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) 
 Cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 4.3 million, or 37.9 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher personnel costs and higher expense for supplies and lab services. Increases in personnel costs reflect a higher headcount, due to additions made to support business growth in response to growing test report volumes, as well as merit and annual inflationary wage adjustment for existing employees. Higher expense for supplies and lab services also reflects higher test report volumes. 
 Due to the nature of our business, a significant portion of our cost of sales expenses represents fixed costs associated with our testing operations. Accordingly, our cost of sales expense will not necessarily increase or decrease commensurately with the change in net revenues from period to period. We expect our cost of sales expenses (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) to continue to increase in future periods as we hire additional laboratory personnel and related resources to support expected operational growth and higher test volumes. 
 
 Gross Margin 
 Our gross margin percentage was 79.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 77.9 for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues which were attributable to increases in both test report volumes and average selling prices, partially offset by higher personnel costs, higher expense for supplies, and higher expense incurred through our expanded laboratory capacity and higher test report volumes.

Table of Contents 

 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 0.6 million, or 4.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and primarily reflect slightly lower expense for clinical studies and personnel costs. 
 We expect to continue incurring research and development expenses through our continued investments in our ongoing pipeline initiatives and as we seek opportunities to build evidentiary support and new tests where commercial opportunities exist. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 The following table provides a breakdown of SG A expenses (in thousands):

 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 1.3 million, or 4.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher travel and transportation costs incurred through our business development activities as well as slightly higher marketing costs and relatively consistent personnel costs. Stock-based compensation expense included in sales and marketing was 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 4.5 million, or 28.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily due to higher personnel costs, higher professional fees and higher information technology related costs. Higher personnel cost reflects headcount expansions in our administrative support functions as well as merit and annual inflationary wage adjustment for existing employees. Stock-based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense was 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.3 million and remains consistent as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased by 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of higher average balances of marketable investment securities and slightly higher interest rates. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased by 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to interest incurred on our long-term debt where we had no debt outstanding during the comparative period. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense was 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and was due to revisions in estimated pre-tax income, reflecting uncertainty in continued Medicare coverage for our DecisionDx-SCC test and updated information, as well as stock-based compensation, permanent differences, changes in valuation allowance, research and development tax credit and state income taxes. We recorded a minimal amount in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
 Stock-based compensation expense, which is allocated among cost of sales, research and development expense and SG A expense, was 13.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect material increases in stock-based compensation expense in future periods, attributable to both existing awards outstanding and anticipated additional grants to our current and future employees. As of September 30, 2024, we had 710 employees, compared to 587 as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding awards was 77.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.

 Net Revenues 
 Net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 92.1 million, or 59.9 , to 245.8 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 63.1 million increase in revenue from our dermatologic tests and a 29.0 million increase in revenue from our non-dermatologic tests. 
 The 63.1 million increase from our dermatologic tests was primarily due to a higher ASP for DecisionDx-SCC test, where we began receiving Medicare reimbursement at a higher rate beginning in July 2023, a 52.3 increase in DecisionDx-SCC test report volumes, and a 10.5 increase in DecisionDx-Melanoma test report volumes. 
 The 29.0 million increase in revenue from our non-dermatologic tests was largely attributable to a 152 increase in tests report volumes for our TissueCypher test, and, to a much lesser extent, a higher realized ASP. Increases in our TissueCypher test report volumes reflect growth through our sales force efforts as well as the impacts of a temporary pause in accepting new orders from July 2023 through September 2023, during which time our lab operations team successfully implemented certain process improvements, automations, and operational enhancements for this test to support future growth. Our IDgenetix and DecisionDx-UM tests also contributed to the increase in non-dermatologic revenues, with both tests having higher test report volumes as well as higher ASPs. Net revenue from our non-dermatologic tests as a percentage of total net revenue increased from 15.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 21.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cost of Sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) 
 Cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 11.5 million, or 35.2 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher personnel costs and expense for supplies and lab services. Increases in personnel costs reflect a higher headcount, due to additions made to support business growth in response to growing test report volumes, as well as merit and annual inflationary wage adjustment for existing employees. Higher expense for supplies and lab services also reflects higher test report volumes. 
 Due to the nature of our business, a significant portion of our cost of sales expenses represents fixed costs associated with our testing operations. Accordingly, our cost of sales expense will not necessarily increase or decrease commensurately with the change in net revenues from period to period.

 hire additional laboratory personnel and related resources to support our expected operational growth and higher test volumes. 
 
 Gross Margin 
 Our gross margin percentage was 79.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 74.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher personnel costs, higher expense for supplies and lab services and higher expense incurred through our expanded laboratory capacity and higher test report volumes. 
 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 0.4 million, or 0.9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting lower clinical studies costs, lower organizational development costs, and lower expense for laboratory supplies, partially offset by higher personnel costs. 
 We expect to continue incurring research and development expenses through our continued investments in our ongoing pipeline initiatives and as we seek opportunities to build evidentiary support and new tests where commercial opportunities exist.

 Stock-based compensation expense, which is allocated among cost of sales, research and development expense and SG A expense, totaled 38.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 39.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect material increases in stock-based compensation expense in future periods, attributable to both existing awards outstanding and anticipated additional grants to our current and future employees. As of September 30, 2024, we had 710 employees compared to 587 as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding awards was 77.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable investment securities, cash generated from the sale of our products and our line-of-credit under the 2024 Loan and Security Agreement (the 2024 LSA ). All of our marketable investment securities are considered investment grade, are readily available for use in current operations and have contractual maturities of one year or less. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had marketable investment securities of 184.8 million and 144.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 95.0 million and 98.8 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had a 25 million credit-line available under the 2024 LSA. 
 Our liquidity has been primarily derived from the revenue generated from the sale of our products and proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock in July 29, 2019 (the IPO and our follow-on public offerings of common stock in June and December of 2020. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable investment securities and anticipated cash generated from sales of our products will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and could result in us depleting our capital resources sooner than expected. 
 As mentioned above, we expect to use a portion of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable investment securities to further support and accelerate our research and development activities, including the clinical studies noted above in Components of the Results of Operations Research and Development. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, clinical research and development services, laboratory operations, equipment and related supplies, legal and other regulatory expenses, general administrative costs and, from time to time, expansion of our laboratory and office facilities in support of our growth, such as the construction of our future corporate headquarters. We anticipate that a substantial portion of our cash requirements in the foreseeable future will relate to the further commercialization of our currently marketed products, the development of our future product candidates in our pipeline and the potential commercialization of these pipeline products, should their development be successful, and the construction of our future corporate headquarters. 
 In July 2023, following approval by our board of directors, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a plot of land located in Friendswood, Texas for a purchase price of 7.6 million, subject to certain adjustments, for the purpose of developing a commercial office building to be used as our future corporate headquarters. In February 2024, we closed on the purchase of the land for cash consideration of 7.2 million. The development project will include a four-story headquarters building, which will encompass approximately 80,000 square feet of Class A office space. Construction began in May 2024 and is expected to continue through early 2026, at which time the building 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 is expected to be ready for occupancy and use. Over the duration of this project, we expect to make significant capital expenditures in form of payments to the developer under a percentage of completion basis. As of September 30, 2024, the development project is expected to cost a total of approximately 40 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have made minimal capital expenditures in the planning and early development phases of this project. We intend to use the proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan, the 2024 Credit Line and our existing cash and cash equivalents to pay for this project. 
 In connection with our acquisition of AltheaDx, we agreed to pay contingent consideration of up 75.0 million, payable 50 in cash and 50 in common stock, based on the achievement of certain commercial milestones relating to the years ending December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. The portion of the AltheaDx Earnout Payments associated with the commercial milestones for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 37.5 million and was not paid since the applicable commercial milestones were not met. The AltheaDx Earnout Payments included a 2022 catch-up provision for additional payment of up to 17.5 million that expired in 2023. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, we have a potential payment obligation of up to 20.0 million with respect to the remaining commercial milestones for 2024. The number of shares of our common stock that may be issued in connection with the commercial milestone payment for 2024 is subject to limitations. As of September 30, 2024, we believe it to be unlikely that the remaining commercial milestones will be met and that future payments will be due. 
 Since our inception, we have generally incurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a net loss of 57.5 million, used 5.6 million in operating cash flows, and had an accumulated deficit of 218.4 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 8.7 million and positive operating cash flows of 40.5 million. Our ability to maintain profitability will heavily depend on us maintaining Medicare coverage for our currently marketed products, on the successful commercialization of the products we plan to launch in the future, and our ability to manage operating expenses. We expect to incur additional expenses in the future as we invest in the commercialization of our existing products and the development and commercialization of our current pipeline products and future product candidates. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable investment securities and anticipated cash generated from the sale of our commercial products will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We believe we will meet longer-term expected cash requirements and obligations through a combination of existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable investment securities and anticipated cash generated from sales of our products and issuances of equity securities or debt offerings. However, we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing genomic tests, including, among others, the uncertainty of: 
 successful commencement and completion of clinical study protocols; 
 successful identification and acquisition of tissue samples; 
 the development and validation of genomic classifiers; and 
 acceptance of new genomic tests by clinicians, patients and third-party payors including competitor actions. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate our exact working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of, many factors, including those listed above as well as those listed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the 2023 10-K and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC. 
 In the event additional funding is required, we expect that we would use a combination of equity and debt financings, which may not be available to us when needed, on terms that we deem to be favorable or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any disruptions to, or volatility in, the credit and financial markets or any deterioration in overall economic conditions may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain, more costly and/or more dilutive. If we are unable to raise additional funds through debt or equity financing or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product discovery and development activities or future commercialization efforts.

 Long-Term Debt 
 We had no debt as of December 31, 2023. Our long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 is presented in the table below (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 (Unaudited) Term debt 10,200 Unamortized discount (185) Total long-term debt 10,015 Less: Current portion of long-term debt Total 10,015 
 2024 Loan and Security Agreement 
 On March 26, 2024 (the Closing Date ), we entered into the 2024 LSA, by and between the Company, its wholly owned subsidiary, Castle Narnia Real Estate Holding 1, LLC and Silicon Valley Bank, a division of First-Citizens Bank Trust Company (the Lender ). The 2024 LSA provides for (i) on the Closing Date, 10.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans (discussed in the 2024 Term Loan section below), and (ii) from the Closing Date until March 31, 2025, an additional line of credit of 25.0 million with the same interest rate and maturity as the term debt available (discussed in 2024 Credit Line below) at our option. 
 The obligations under the 2024 LSA are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property, the real property held by the Company, and are subject to certain other exceptions and limitations. We have the right to prepay the 2024 LSA in whole, subject to a prepayment fee of approximately 1.50 if paid prior to March 26, 2026. Amounts repaid under the 2024 LSA may not be reborrowed. 
 In addition, the 2024 LSA contains customary conditions of borrowing, events of default and covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other entities, incur indebtedness and make distributions to holders of our capital stock. Should an event of default occur, including the occurrence of a material adverse change, we could be liable for immediate repayment of all obligations under the 2024 LSA. Should we seek to amend the terms of the 2024 LSA, the consent of the Lender would be required. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with this covenant. 
 The 2024 LSA bears interest at a floating rate equal to the greater of (a) the WSJ Prime Rate plus 0.25 or (b) 6.00 per annum. The Term Loans are interest only from the Closing Date through November 30, 2025, which may be extended at our option through November 30, 2026 as long as no event of default under the 2024 LSA has occurred. After the end of the interest only period, we are required to pay equal monthly installments of principal through the maturity date of November 1, 2028. 
 We are also obligated to make an additional final payment of 2.00 of the aggregate original principal amounts of Term Loans advanced by the Lender, due at the earlier of the maturity date or date the Term Loans are repaid in full. 
 2024 Term Loan 
 On March 26, 2024, we drew 10.0 million in Term Loans under the terms and provisions of the 2024 LSA. We are obligated to make a final payment of 0.2 million under the terms of the 2024 LSA final payment provisions. A discount on debt equal to this obligation was recorded on the draw date and is being amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the debt. As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate for all outstanding debt under the 2024 Term Loan was 8.60 . 
 2024 Credit Line 
 We have a 25.0 million line of credit under the terms and provisions of the 2024 LSA available from the Closing Date until March 31, 2025. Amounts repaid under the 2024 Credit Line may not be reborrowed. As of September 30, 2024, no draws had been made on the line of credit. 
 Leases 
 We have entered into various operating and finance leases, which are primarily associated with our laboratory facilities and office space. 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 Total undiscounted future minimum payment obligations under our operating leases and finance leases as of September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 24.0 million, of which 0.8 million is payable through the remainder of 2024 and 23.2 million is payable through early 2034. The leases expire on various dates through 2034 and provide certain options to renew for additional periods. 
 We expect our lease obligations may increase in the future as we expand our facilities, operations and headcount in support of the anticipated growth in our portfolio of commercial products and pipeline tests. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (unaudited) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 40,501 (24,213) Net cash used in investing activities (55,907) (8,511) Net cash provided by financing activities 11,524 999 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (3,882) (31,725) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 98,841 122,948 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 94,959 91,223 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 40.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was primarily attributable to non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 38.9 million, depreciation and amortization of 10.2 million, net income of 8.7 million, deferred income taxes of 3.7 million and decreases in inventory of 1.4 million, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of 11.9 million, increases in accretion of discounts on marketable investment securities of 5.1 million, decreases in accounts payable of 3.8 million, increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 1.7 million and decreases in accrued compensation of 1.3 million. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 24.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily attributable to the net loss of 54.9 million, increases in accounts receivable of 13.8 million, increases in accretion of discounts on marketable investment securities of 3.9 million, decreases in accrued compensation of 2.0 million and increases in inventory of 1.8 million, partially offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 39.4 million, depreciation and amortization of 9.1 million, a change in accounts payable of 2.7 million and a change in other accrued and current liabilities of 1.4 million. 
 The 64.7 million increase in cash inflows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to increases in collections from customers attributable to higher net revenues partially offset by increases in operating expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 net revenues increased by 59.9 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which outpaced the 11.6 increase in net operating expenses for the same period. In part, the cash provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the payment of annual cash bonuses to our employees as well as certain health care benefit payments totaling 20.8 million, that are not expected to recur during the remainder of 2024. In comparison, we paid 17.7 million during the same period in 2023 towards annual cash bonuses and certain health care benefits. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 55.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of purchases of marketable investment securities of 158.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of 20.8 million, partially offset by the maturity of marketable investment securities of 123.3 million. Net cash used in investing activities was 8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted primarily of purchases of marketable investment securities of 136.7 million and purchases of property and equipment of 9.8 million, partially offset by the maturity of marketable investment securities of 138.0 million. 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 The 47.4 million increase in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to purchasing 21.7 million more in marketable investment securities and collecting 14.7 million fewer proceeds from maturing marketable investment securities. We also increased our purchases of property and equipment by 10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to our purchase of land for cash consideration of 7.2 million on February 9, 2024. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted primarily of 10.0 million of proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and 2.3 million of proceeds from contributions to our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP and 1.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the 2.4 million payment of employee taxes attributable to the vesting of Restricted Stock Units RSUs ). 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and primarily consisted of 2.0 million of proceeds from contributions to the ESPP and 0.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the 1.1 million payment of employee taxes attributable to the vesting of RSUs. 
 
 Inflation 
 In 2021, the rate of inflation in the United States began to increase but has continued to subside since the second half of 2022. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial results during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We are unable to predict if the rate of inflation will increase in future periods. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to the information discussed under Critical Accounting Estimates included in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2023 10-K. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily relate to interest rates fluctuations. We had cash and cash equivalents of 95.0 million as of September 30, 2024, which include bank deposits and money market funds. We had marketable investment securities of 184.8 million as of September 30, 2024, which include U.S. government securities. Due to the nature of these instruments, we believe that we have no material exposure to interest rate risk. 
 We had long-term debt of 10.0 million as of September 30, 2024, consisting of an outstanding term loan which bears interest at a floating rate that fluctuates with the WSJ Prime Rate, subject to an interest rate floor of 6.00 . In September 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 50 basis points, lowering the target for key lending rates by half a percent and the WSJ Prime Rate decreased by 50 basis points thereafter. 
 A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial statements. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Our exposure to inflationary pressures is primarily in personnel and related costs. The extent of any future impacts from inflation on our business and our results of operations will be dependent upon how long the elevated inflation levels persist and if the rate of inflation were to further increase, neither of which we are able to predict. If elevated levels of inflation were to persist or if the rate of inflation were to accelerate, the purchasing power of our cash and cash equivalents may be eroded, our expenses could increase faster than anticipated and we may utilize our capital resources sooner than expected. Further, given the complexities of the reimbursement landscape in which we operate, our payors may be unwilling or unable to increase reimbursement rates to compensate for inflationary impacts.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Legal proceedings, including litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions could result in material costs, occupy significant management resources and entail civil and criminal penalties, even if we ultimately prevail. On February 1, 2024, we received a Subpoena from the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, seeking documents and information concerning claims submitted for payment under federal healthcare programs. The Subpoena requested that we produce documents relating primarily to interactions with medical providers and billing to government-funded healthcare programs for our tests. The time period covered by the Subpoena is January 1, 2015 through February 1, 2024. We are continuing to cooperate with the government s request and is in the process of responding to the Subpoena. We are unable to predict what action, if any, might be taken in the future by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, or any other governmental authority as a result of the matters related to this Subpoena. No claims have been made against us at this time. This inquiry, and any potential resulting claim asserted against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to address and divert management s attention and other resources. Any potential claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and harm our reputation. Our insurance and indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. We are unable to predict the outcome and are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 other than the updates to the risk factors or new risk factors set forth below. New risk factors that were not included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 have been marked with an asterisk ). 
 We may disclose changes to risk factors or additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Financial Position 
 We may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations, commercialize new products or expand our operations. 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable investment securities and anticipated cash generated from sales of our products will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. If our available cash and cash equivalents, marketable investment securities and anticipated cash generated from sales of our products are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements including because of lower demand for our products, lower than currently expected rates of reimbursement from third-party payors or other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. In March 2024, we entered into the 2024 LSA, by and between us, our wholly owned subsidiary, Castle Narnia Real Estate Holding 1, LLC and the Lender. The 2024 LSA provides for (i) on the Closing Date, 10.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans, and (ii) from the Closing Date until March 31, 2025, an additional 25.0 million available at our option. We drew 10.0 million in Term Loans on the Closing Date. We expect to use the proceeds for the purpose of developing a commercial office building to be used as our future corporate headquarters, and the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
 We may consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons, including to: 
 increase our sales and marketing efforts for the DecisionDx-Melanoma, DecisionDx-SCC, MyPath Melanoma, DecisionDx-UM, TissueCypher and IDgenetix tests and address competitive developments among these or future commercial products; 
 fund ongoing evidence development for our existing products as well as additional pipeline programs; 
 expand our laboratory testing facility and related testing capacity; 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 expand our technologies into other types of dermatological, ocular, gastrointestinal or mental health disorders; 
 acquire, license or invest in technologies; 
 acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and 
 finance capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses. 
 Our present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 our ability to achieve revenue growth; 
 our rate of progress in establishing payor coverage and reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors; 
 our rate of progress in, and cost of the sales, marketing, coverage and reimbursement activities associated with, establishing adoption of our lead product, DecisionDx-Melanoma, among our other products; 
 the cost of expanding our laboratory operations and offerings, including our sales, marketing, coverage and reimbursement efforts; 
 our rate of progress in, and cost of research and development activities associated with, diagnostic products in research and early development; 
 the potential cost of, and delays in, the development of new products as a result of changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products; 
 acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies; 
 the duration and effects of elevated inflation; 
 the effects on our operations of general political and economic conditions and evolving macroeconomic developments, including geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine by Russia and related sanctions or the Israel-Hamas war, public health crises, economic slowdowns, labor shortages, recessions or market corrections, supply chain disruptions, inflation and monetary policy shifts, bank failures or other disruptions in the banking system or financing markets, rising interest rates and tightening of credit markets resulting from the conflict or other evolving macroeconomic developments; and 
 the effect of competing technological and market developments. 
 To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. 
 If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or products, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. 
 Any disruptions to, or volatility in, the credit and financial markets or any deterioration in overall economic conditions may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain, more costly and/or more dilutive. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our commercialization, research and development efforts or grant rights to third parties to market and/or develop products that we would otherwise prefer to market and develop ourselves.

Table of Contents 

 The terms of the Loan and Security Agreement place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility. 
 In March 2024, we entered into the 2024 LSA with the Lender, which provides for (i) on the Closing Date, 10.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans, and (ii) from the Closing Date until March 31, 2025, an additional 25.0 million available at our option. The 2024 LSA includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as standard events of default, including an event of default based on the occurrence of a material adverse event. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on us transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying cash dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, selling assets and making any payment on subordinated debt, in each case subject to certain exceptions. These restrictive covenants could limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to pursue business opportunities that we or our stockholders may consider beneficial. In addition, the Lender could declare a default upon the occurrence of any event that it interprets could have a material adverse effect, as defined in the 2024 LSA. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, the Lender may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the 2024 LSA. Any declaration by the Lender of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay these outstanding obligations at the time any event of default occurs. Further, if we raise any additional capital through debt financing, the terms of such additional debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Our products are currently marketed as LDTs, and any changes in regulations or the FDA s enforcement discretion for LDTs, or violations of regulations by us, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. 
 The diagnostics industry is highly regulated, and we cannot assure you that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly and adversely in the future. In many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. Although the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has generally exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable regulations with respect to in vitro diagnostics IVD that are designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. These tests are referred to as LDTs. We currently market our products as LDTs. 
 On April 29, 2024, the FDA published final regulations under 21 CFR Part 809 under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD C Act to make explicit that IVD products are devices under the FD C Act, removing much of the FDA s historical enforcement discretion for most LDTs. In conjunction with this final rule, the FDA proposed to phase out its general enforcement discretion approach for LDTs so that IVDs manufactured by a laboratory would generally fall under the same enforcement approach as other IVDs. This final rule also provides that FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion and generally not enforce premarket review and quality system requirements (except for requirements under Part 820, subpart M (records)) for currently marketed IVDs offered as LDTs that were first marketed prior to April 29, 2024 and intends to exercise enforcement discretion and generally not enforce premarket review requirements for LDTs approved by the NYS CLEP. We believe that our tests will continue to be subject to FDA enforcement discretion in their current forms. Additionally, pursuant to the final rule, the FDA will gradually end its general enforcement discretion approach in five stages over a four-year period for other LDTs not approved by NYS CLEP or not already on market. Each stage of the proposed phaseout period would subject LDTs to a set of regulatory requirements. For example, the first stage of the phaseout would require LDT developers to comply with medical device reporting requirements and correction and removal reporting requirements by May 6, 2025. LDTs that are considered higher risk IVDs would be subject to premarket review requirements within three and a half years, and LDTs that are considered moderate or low risk IVDs would be subject to premarket submission requirements within four years after the FDA publishes the final rule. While the enforcement policy is phased out, the FDA could still decide to pursue enforcement action at any time against LDTs that it deems to be violative of its regulations when appropriate. 
 All of our existing tests were marketed prior to April 29, 2024 and are conducted in labs licensed by the New York State Department of Health. If the FDA were to determine that our tests, or modifications thereof, are not within the scope of the FDA's enforcement discretion policy for LDTs for any reason, including based on these final rules or new rules, regulations, policies or guidance, or due to changes in statute, our existing tests may become subject to extensive FDA requirements, or our business may otherwise be adversely affected and lead to potential adverse

 effects on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, under the terms of this FDA final rule, any future Castle tests developed and commercialized are likely to be subject to extensive FDA requirements which may adversely impact our business, prospects, results of operations and financial conditions. In addition, we would be required to obtain 510(k) or premarket approval PMA for certain of our tests by October 1, 2027. We would also be subject to device registration and listing requirements, medical device reporting requirements and the requirements of the FDA s Quality System Regulation. We may be required to conduct clinical trials prior to continuing to sell our existing products or launching any other products we may develop. This may increase the cost of conducting, or otherwise harm, our business. 
 Even if the FDA does not modify its policy of enforcement discretion, the FDA may disagree that we are marketing our LDTs within the scope of its policy of enforcement discretion and may impose significant regulatory requirements. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations as historically enforced by the FDA, we cannot assure you that the FDA will agree with our determination. A determination that we have violated these laws and regulations, or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. 
 We may be required to obtain premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or a PMA for any future test we wish to offer. The process for submitting a 510(k) premarket notification and receiving FDA clearance usually takes from three to 12 months, but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never guaranteed. The process for submitting and obtaining FDA approval of a PMA is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain. It generally takes from one to three years or even longer, and approval is not guaranteed. PMA approval typically requires extensive clinical data and can be significantly longer, more expensive and more uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. Despite the time, effort and expense expended, there can be no assurance that a particular device ultimately will be cleared or approved by the FDA through either the 510(k) clearance process or the PMA process on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any cleared or approved labeling claims will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our products. If premarket review is required for some or all of our products, the FDA may require that we stop selling our products pending clearance or approval, which would negatively impact our business. Even if our products are allowed to remain on the market prior to clearance or approval, demand or reimbursement for our products may decline if there is uncertainty about our products, if we are required to label our products as investigational by the FDA, or if the FDA limits the labeling claims we are permitted to make for our products. As a result, we could experience significantly increased development costs and a delay in generating additional revenue from our products, or from other pipeline products. Furthermore, it could reduce our revenues or increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to Reimbursement and Government Regulation 
 We generally have limited reimbursement coverage for our products, and if third-party payors, including government and commercial payors, do not provide sufficient coverage of, or adequate reimbursement for, our products, our commercial success, including revenue, will be negatively affected. 
 Our revenue depends on achieving broad coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including both government and commercial third-party payors. If third-party payors do not provide coverage of, or do not provide adequate reimbursement for, a substantial portion of the list price of our products, we may need to seek additional payment from the patient beyond any co-payments and deductibles, which may adversely affect demand for our products. Coverage determinations by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, a third-party payor s determination of whether our products are appropriate, medically necessary or cost-effective. If we are unable to provide third-party payors with sufficient evidence of the clinical utility and validity of our products, they may not provide coverage, or may provide limited coverage, which will adversely affect our revenues and our ability to succeed. To the extent that more competitors enter our markets, the availability of coverage and the reimbursement rate for our products may decrease as we encounter pricing pressure from these competitors. 
 Since each third-party payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy to cover our products, enter into a contract with us and set the amount it will reimburse for a product, these negotiations are a time-consuming and costly process, and they do not guarantee that the third-party payor will provide coverage or adequate reimbursement for our products. In addition, the determinations by a third-party payor whether to cover our products and the amount it will reimburse for them are often made on an indication-by-indication basis. 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 In cases where there is no coverage policy or we do not have a contracted rate for reimbursement as a participating provider, the patient is typically responsible for a greater share of the cost of the product, which may result in further delay of our revenue, increase our collection costs or decrease the likelihood of collection. 
 Our claims for reimbursement from third-party payors may be denied upon submission, and we may need to take additional steps to receive payment, such as appealing the denials. Such appeals and other processes are time-consuming and expensive and may not result in payment. Third-party payors may perform audits of historically paid claims and attempt to recoup funds years after the funds were initially distributed if the third-party payors believe the funds were paid in error or determine that our products were medically unnecessary. If a third-party payor audits our claims and issues a negative audit finding, and we are not able to overturn the audit findings through appeal, the recoupment may result in a material adverse effect on our revenue. Additionally, in some cases commercial third-party payors for whom we are not a participating provider may elect at any time to review claims previously paid and determine the amount they paid was too much. In these situations, the third-party payor will typically notify us of their decision and then offset whatever amount they determine they overpaid against amounts they owe us on current claims. We cannot predict when, or how often, a third-party payor might engage in these reviews and we may not be able to dispute these retroactive adjustments. 
 Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue at the amount we expect to be entitled, subject to a constraint for variable consideration, in the period in which our tests are delivered to the treating clinician. We have determined that our contracts contain variable consideration under ASC 606 because the amounts paid by third-party payors may be paid at less than our standard rates or not paid at all, with such differences considered implicit price concessions. Variable consideration is recognized only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur in future periods when the uncertainties are resolved. 
 Variable consideration is evaluated each reporting period and adjustments are recorded as increases or decreases in revenues. Variable consideration for Medicare claims that are not covered by Medicare, including those claims undergoing appeal, is deemed to be fully constrained due to factors outside our influence (e.g., judgment or actions of third parties) and the uncertainty of the amount to be received is not expected to be resolved for a long period of time. For these fully constrained claims, we generally recognize revenue in the period the uncertainties are resolved, if favorable. Due to potential future changes in Medicare coverage policies and appeal cycles, insurance coverage policies, contractual rates and other trends in the reimbursement of our tests, our revenues may fluctuate significantly from period to period. 
 Although we are an in-network participating provider with some commercial third-party payors, including several Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, and certain large, national commercial third-party payors, including Aetna, other commercial third-party payors have issued non-coverage policies that currently categorize our tests as experimental or investigational. If we are not successful in obtaining coverage from third-party payors, in reversing existing non-coverage policies, or if other third-party payors issue similar non-coverage policies, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 
 The process to obtain Medicare coverage is lengthy, time-consuming, has changed over time, may change in the future and requires significant dedication of resources, and as we develop or acquire new products, we may be unsuccessful in receiving Medicare coverage for those products or in maintaining our current Medicare coverage. On a periodic basis, CMS requests bids for its MAC services, and MAC jurisdictions have changed in the past. A change in our MAC, or future changes in the MolDX program, the elimination of the program, or a change in the administrator of that program, may affect our ability to maintain Medicare coverage and reimbursement for products for which we have coverage, obtain Medicare coverage for products for which we do not yet have coverage, or obtain Medicare coverage for any products we may launch in the future, or delay payments for our tests. Additionally, MACs that currently provide coverage for our products may periodically reevaluate their coverage decisions and decide to withdraw coverage based on a number of factors that we may not be able to predict or control. Accordingly, current Medicare coverage of our tests or a history of coverage by Medicare is no guarantee of future Medicare coverage. We have received positive coverage decisions and receive Medicare reimbursement for our DecisionDx-Melanoma, DecisionDx-UM, MyPath Melanoma tests, and IDgenetix. Our DecisionDx-SCC and TissueCypher tests receive Medicare reimbursement as well. If coverage for one or more of our products is withdrawn, our business could be adversely impacted. 
 On June 2, 2023, Novitas the MAC responsible for administering claims for test reports issued by our Pittsburgh laboratory, posted a finalized oncology biomarker LCD pursuant to which the DecisionDx-SCC test would no longer be covered by Medicare effective July 17, 2023. However, on July 6, 2023, Novitas suspended the final version of the LCD and announced its intent to post a new proposed LCD for comment and presentation at an open meeting. On July 27, 2023, Novitas posted a nearly identical proposed oncology biomarker LCD that continues to intend to

 rely upon evidentiary reviews sourced from three databases: ClinGen, OncoKB and NCCN. The proposed LCD also recommends non-coverage for our DecisionDx-SCC test. The comment period for the proposed LCD ended on September 9, 2023. On July 26, 2024, Novitas posted a note that it had been granted an extension by CMS. We cannot predict whether this LCD will be finalized as proposed or what the timing of any final LCD might be. 
 Palmetto s MolDX program oversees MAAA tests that are reported from our Phoenix laboratory and Noridian is the MAC responsible for administering claims for test reports issued by our Phoenix laboratory. On June 8, 2023, both Palmetto and Noridian posted a preliminary draft LCD recommending no coverage for DecisionDx-SCC. The comment period for the draft LCDs ended on July 22, 2023. On July 4, 2024, the LCD was finalized as proposed with a future effective date of August 18, 2024. 
 Under Medicare, payment for products like ours is generally made under the CLFS with payment amounts assigned to specific procedure billing codes. Medicare reimbursement rates for our tests are subject to change and may decrease from those currently in effect. For example, in February 2023, MolDX notified us that IDgenetix should shift billing to a different multi-test generic gene sequencing CPT code and continue using the IDgenetix Z-Code beginning in March 2023. As a result of this change, the Medicare reimbursement rate for the IDgenetix multi-gene panel decreased from approximately 1,500 to 917 per test. We subsequently obtained a test-specific PLA CPT code which became effective October 1, 2023. In November 2023, CMS posted its final CLFS determination which crosswalks our PLA CPT code to an existing PLA code at a rate of 1,336 per test effective January 1, 2024. 
 In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act PAMA which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services are paid under Medicare. Under PAMA, certain laboratories are required to report to CMS commercial third-party payor payment rates and volumes for each test they perform. CMS uses this data to calculate a weighted median payment rate for each test, which will be used to establish revised Medicare CLFS reimbursement rates for the test. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. We bill Medicare for our products, and therefore we are subject to reporting requirements under PAMA. 
 If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement rates from commercial third-party payors, this may adversely affect our Medicare rate. It is unclear what impact new pricing structures, such as those adopted under PAMA, may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 The U.S. federal government continues to show significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform and reducing healthcare costs. Similarly, commercial third-party payors may seek to reduce costs by limiting coverage or reducing reimbursement for our products. Any government-adopted reform measures or changes to commercial third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies could cause significant pressure on the pricing of, and reimbursement for, healthcare products and services, including our products, which could decrease demand for our products, and adversely affect our sales and revenue. 
 In addition, some third-party payors have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, laboratory benefit management programs, often using third-party benefit managers to manage these programs. The stated goals of these programs are to help improve the quality of outpatient laboratory services, support evidence-based guidelines for patient care and lower costs. The impact on laboratories, such as ours, of active laboratory benefit management by third parties is unclear, and we expect that it could have a negative impact on our revenue in the short term. It is possible that third-party payors will resist reimbursement for the products that we offer, in favor of less expensive products, may require pre-approval for our products or may impose additional pricing pressure on and substantial administrative burden for reimbursement for our products. 
 We expect to continue to focus substantial resources on increasing coverage and reimbursement for our current products and any future products we may develop. We believe it may take several years to achieve broad coverage and adequate contracted reimbursement with a majority of third-party payors for our products. 
 However, we cannot predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels third-party payors will cover and reimburse our products. If we fail to establish and maintain broad adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our products, our ability to generate revenue could be harmed and our future prospects and our business could suffer. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Use of Proceeds from IPO of Common Stock 
 On July 29, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold 4,600,000 shares of our common stock, including 600,000 shares associated with the full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of 16.00 per share.

 The offer and sale of all of the shares of our common stock in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to our Registration Statements on Form S-1, as amended (File Nos. 333-232369 and 333-232796), which were declared or became effective on July 24, 2019. 
 There has been no material change in our planned use of the net proceeds from the IPO as described in the final prospectus filed with the SEC on July 26, 2019 relating to our Registration Statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-232369 and 333-232796). 
 Since the effective date of our registration statement through September 30, 2024, we have not used any of the net proceeds from the IPO. Pending such uses, we have invested, and plan to continue to invest, the balance of the net proceeds from the IPO in cash and cash equivalent securities or highly liquid investment securities.
