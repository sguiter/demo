equity interest in RP
Finance LLC RP Finance ), which was, until March 13, 2024 (the date of the RP Finance Consolidation, as described in Note
3), accounted for under the equity method. RP Finance is an entity associated with members of the family of Howard Jonas (Executive Chairman,
Chairman of the Board, and controlling stockholder of the Company) which holds equity interest of RP Finance. RP Finance holds debt
and equity investments in Cornerstone. In October 2021, Cornerstone received negative results of its Avenger 500 Phase 3 study for Devimistat
in pancreatic cancer as well as a recommendation to stop its ARMADA 2000 Phase 3 study due to a determination that the trial would unlikely
achieve its primary endpoint (the Data Events ). Due to the Data Events, RP Finance fully impaired its then debt and equity
investments in Cornerstone. 

On March 13, 2024, Cornerstone consummated a restructuring
of its outstanding debt and equity interests (the Cornerstone Restructuring ). As a result of the Cornerstone Restructuring,
Rafael became a owner of the issued and outstanding common stock of Cornerstone (the Cornerstone Acquisition ), and Cornerstone
became a consolidated subsidiary of Rafael. The Cornerstone Acquisition is accounted for as an acquisition of a variable interest entity
that is not a business in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company was determined to be the accounting acquirer for financial reporting
purposes. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the transaction. In conjunction with
the Cornerstone Restructuring and Cornerstone Acquisition, the Company reassessed its relationship with RP Finance, and as a result determined
that RP Finance is still a variable interest entity and that the Company became the primary beneficiary of RP Finance as the Company now
holds the ability to control repayment of the RP Finance Line of Credit which directly impacts RP Finance s economic performance.
Therefore, following the Cornerstone Restructuring and Cornerstone Acquisition, the Company consolidated RP Finance (the RP Finance
Consolidation ). See Note 3 f or additional information on the Consolidation. The Company
is currently reviewing Cornerstone s current efforts, prospects and available resources to determine the optimal operational direction. 

In May 2021,
the Company formed Rafael Medical Devices, an orthopedic-focused medical device company developing instruments to advance minimally invasive
surgeries. In August 2023, the Company raised from third parties in exchange for ownership of Rafael Medical
Devices. 

In April
2023, the Company first invested in Day Three, a company which empowers third-party manufacturers to reimagine their existing cannabis
offerings enabling them to bring to market better, cleaner, more precise and predictable versions by utilizing Day Three s pharmaceutical-grade
technology and innovation like Unlokt . In January 2024, the Company entered into a series of transactions with Day Three
and certain shareholders, acquiring a controlling interest of Day Three and subsequently consolidating Day Three's results (the Day
Three Acquisition ). The Company is evaluating the prospects for Day Three s technology and offerings. 

The Company in these consolidated
financial statements refers to Rafael Holdings and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

of
the outstanding voting interests of Cornerstone (the Cornerstone Acquisition ).
For accounting purposes, Rafael was determined to be the acquirer, as the Company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary
of Cornerstone, a VIE, in accordance with ASC 810. For Rafael, t he Cornerstone Acquisition
is the result of the Cornerstone Restructuring. As part of the Cornerstone Restructuring: 

(i) all issued and outstanding
shares of Cornerstone s preferred stock and non-voting common stock converted into shares of Cornerstone Common Stock (the Mandatory
Common Conversion on a one-for-one basis, which shares of Cornerstone Common Stock were then subjected to the Reverse Stock Split
(as defined below), including the conversion of Rafael's shares of Cornerstone s Series D Preferred Stock into 
shares of post-Reverse Stock Split Cornerstone Common Stock; 

(ii) Cornerstone offered shares
of Cornerstone s Common Stock to all holders of Cornerstone s promissory notes convertible into Cornerstone Series C preferred
stock (the Series C Convertible Notes who were Accredited Investors with the purchase price to be paid through conversion
of the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest on their Series C Convertible Notes held by each holder into Common Stock at
the Cornerstone Restructuring Common Stock Price as described below (the Series C Convertible Notes Exchange ). Approximately
 of the outstanding Series C Convertible Notes participated in the Series C Convertible Notes Exchange, and million of principal
and accrued interest outstanding on the Series C Convertible Notes was converted into shares of post-Reverse Stock Split Cornerstone
Common Stock. Series C Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal and accrued interest amount of million remaining outstanding,
of which Series C Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal and accrued interest amount of thousand were amended in the Cornerstone
Restructuring to (A) extend the maturity date thereof to May 31, 2028 and (B) provide that, on conversion thereof, the converting holder
will receive shares of Cornerstone Common Stock. The holders of these amended Series C Convertible Notes that remain outstanding waived
such holders rights in connection with the Cornerstone Restructuring. Series C Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal and
accrued interest amount of million remained outstanding and were not amended in connection with the Cornerstone Restructuring. The
principal and accrued interest are included in Convertible Notes on the consolidated balance sheets; 

(iii) Rafael converted the
approximately million of the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the RFL Line of Credit (as defined in Note 4) into
 shares of post-Reverse Stock Split Cornerstone Common Stock. The conversion of the RFL Line of Credit, inclusive of accrued
interest, into equity in Cornerstone represents a recovery of a previously written-off asset, and the Company recorded the recovery in
accordance with ASC 326, by recognizing a gain of million, in conjunction with and immediately prior to the Cornerstone Restructuring
equal to the fair value of the Cornerstone Common Stock, up to the amount of principal and accrued interest on the instrument, that was
received in settlement of the RFL Line of Credit in connection with the Cornerstone Restructuring. Upon the consummation of the Cornerstone
Acquisition, the investment was eliminated as Cornerstone became a majority-owned subsidiary of Rafael and the difference between the
investment s carrying value and its fair value included in purchase consideration, which is based on the value of Cornerstone s
Common Stock, resulted in a gain of million that was recorded to the Company s additional paid-in capital given the related
party nature of the transaction; 

(iv) Rafael converted the
approximately million of the outstanding principal and accrued interest pursuant to the 2023 Promissory Note (as defined in Note
4) into shares of post-Reverse Stock Split Cornerstone Common Stock. Prior to the Cornerstone Restructuring, the Company recorded
the 2023 Promissory Note at its fair value as the security was classified as available-for-sale. The 2023 Promissory Note is included
in the consideration paid at its fair value (which was deemed to be the fair value of the Cornerstone Common Stock received) in the Cornerstone
Acquisition in accordance with ASC 810-10-30-4. The Company recognized a gain of million for the realization of previously unrealized
gains on the fair value of the 2023 Promissory Note in other comprehensive loss;

consummation of the Cornerstone Restructuring, and (iv) terminate all future lending obligations of RP Finance under the RPF Line of Credit
(as so amended, the Amended RPF Line of Credit 

(vi) Rafael invested an additional
 million in cash in exchange for shares of post-Reverse Stock Split Cornerstone Common Stock; 

(vii) Cornerstone amended
and restated its certificate of incorporation, to, among other things, effect a reverse split of all of Cornerstone s capital stock
on a one-for-ten basis (the Reverse Stock Split ), set the number of authorized shares of Cornerstone Common Stock to be
sufficient for issuance of the Common Stock in the Cornerstone Restructuring and eliminate the authorized preferred stock not required
to be authorized as a result of the Mandatory Common Conversion; 

(viii) Cornerstone amended
prior agreements in place giving certain parties rights to designate members of the Board and those rights have been eliminated. All directors
are elected by the Cornerstone stockholders and as the majority stockholder, Rafael can control that vote. The Company has entered into
a voting agreement (the Voting Agreement whereby Rafael has agreed to maintain three directors of Cornerstone that are
independent of Rafael; and 

(ix) Cornerstone increased
the available reserve of Cornerstone Common Stock for grant to employees, consultants and other service providers to approximately 
of Cornerstone s fully diluted capital stock (the Reserve Increase ). 

Acquisition of Cornerstone 

As a result of the Cornerstone Restructuring,
Rafael became a owner of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of Cornerstone, which became a consolidated subsidiary of Rafael.
The Cornerstone Acquisition is accounted for as an acquisition of a VIE that is not a business in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company
was determined to be the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. The guidance requires an initial screen test to determine
if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets. If that
screen test is met, the acquired entity is not a business for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the Cornerstone Acquisition was
accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value of Cornerstone s gross assets is concentrated within
in-process research and development, an intangible asset. 

Under ASC 810, the initial consolidation of a
VIE shall not result in goodwill being recognized, and the acquirer shall recognize a gain or loss for the difference of (a) the sum of
(i) the fair value of any consideration paid, (ii) the fair value of any noncontrolling interests, and (iii) the reported amount of any
previously held interests, and (b) the net amount of the VIE s identifiable assets and liabilities recognized and measured in accordance
with ASC 805, Business Combinations ASC 805 ). In accordance with the calculation within ASC 810, no gain or loss
was recognized on the Cornerstone Acquisition. 

The net amount of the VIE s identifiable
assets and liabilities recognized with respect to the Cornerstone Acquisition is based upon management s preliminary estimates of
and assumptions related to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, using currently available information. For this
purpose, fair value shall be determined in accordance with the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosure s.

in the Company s equity ownership interest in Cornerstone). In conjunction with the Cornerstone Acquisition, the Company reassessed
its relationship with RP Finance and, as a result of the Cornerstone Restructuring and resulting Cornerstone Acquisition, determined that
RP Finance is still a VIE and that the Company is now considered the primary beneficiary of RP Finance as the Company now holds the ability
to control repayment of the RPF Line of Credit, which directly impacts RP Finance s economic performance. Therefore, the Company
has consolidated RP Finance as a result of the Cornerstone Acquisition (the RP Finance Consolidation ). The RP Finance Consolidation
is accounted for as an acquisition of a VIE that is not a business in accordance with U.S. GAAP as RP Finance does not meet the definition
of a business under U.S. GAAP. 

Under ASC 810, the initial consolidation of a
VIE shall not result in goodwill being recognized, and the acquirer shall recognize a gain or loss for the difference of (a) the sum of
(i) the fair value of any consideration paid, (ii) the fair value of any noncontrolling interests, and (iii) the reported amount of any
previously held interests, and (b) the net amount of the VIE s identifiable assets and liabilities recognized and measured in accordance
with ASC 805. 

The following table presents, in accordance with
ASC 810, the sum of (i) the fair value of consideration paid, (ii) the fair value of noncontrolling interests, and (iii) the reported
amount of previously held interests (amounts in thousands): 

(iii) Reported value of previously held interests (1)

shares of Cornerstone Common Stock. 

The Company assumed Cornerstone's liability to

for a purchase price of million. The Company also received a warrant exercisable for shares of common stock, post DTL Reverse
Stock Split, which expires from the date of issuance or earlier based on the occurrence of certain events as defined in the
Day Three Purchase Agreement (the Day Three Warrant ). 

Prior to January 2024, the Company accounted for
this investment as an equity method investment in accordance with the guidance in ASC 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint
Ventures . The Company determined that a ownership interest in Day Three and its right to designate two members of the Board of
Directors of Day Three (out of a current total of seven members) indicates that the Company is able to exercise significant influence. 

The Company determined that Day Three is a VIE;
however, the Company determined that, prior to January 2024, it was not the primary beneficiary as it did not have the power to direct
the activities that most significantly impacted Day Three s economic performance. The Company has therefore concluded it was not
required to consolidate Day Three. The Company used the equity method of accounting to record its investment in Day Three. 

Day Three s fiscal year ends on December
31 and, as a result, the Company recognizes its share of Day Three s earnings/loss on a one-month lag. For the three months ended
October 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized approximately thousand and thousand of equity in loss of Day Three, based on
its proportionate share of Day Three s results through January 2, 2024, the effective date of the Day Three Acquisition, as discussed
below. The assets and operations of Day Three are not significant to the Company's assets or operations. 

Acquisition of Day Three 

In January 2024, the Company entered into a series
of transactions with Day Three and certain shareholders to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock, post DTL Reverse Stock
Split, of Day Three, acquiring a controlling interest of Day Three (the Day Three Acquisition ). As a result of the Day Three
Acquisition, the Company holds an aggregate of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Day Three. Day Three has options
and warrants outstanding that, if and when exercised, could dilute the Company's ownership interest in Day Three. In connection with the
Day Three Acquisition, the Day Three Warrant was terminated. The acquisition date was determined to be January 2, 2024, which is the date
that Rafael obtained a controlling interest of the common stock of Day Three. The Day Three Acquisition is being accounted for as a business
combination in accordance with ASC 805. 

During the period of October 2023 through January
2024, the Company advanced to Day Three pursuant to a promissory note (the Day Three Note I ), to Day Three
pursuant to a promissory note (the Day Three Note II ), to Day Three pursuant to a third promissory note (the
 Day Three Note III ), and to Day Three pursuant to a fourth promissory note (the Day Three Note IV (collectively, the Day Three Promissory Notes ). The Day Three Promissory Notes accrue interest at rates of between 
and per annum. 

The aggregate consideration of the Day Three Acquisition
was million, which consisted of 1) cash consideration of million, 2) accrued consideration of million, 3) the exchange
of principal and accrued interest amounts totaling to million owed by Day Three to the Company pursuant to the Day Three Promissory
Notes for common stock, and 4) the fair value of previously held interests in Day Three of million.

During the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company recognized an adjustment which changed the fair value of certain acquired liabilities
and goodwill as a result of obtaining additional information about the estimated liabilities. Further adjustments may be necessary as
additional information related to the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and tax implications thereon is assessed during
the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). 

The noncontrolling interest was recognized at
fair value, which was determined using the implied enterprise value based on the purchase price multiplied by the ratio of the number
of shares owned by minority holders to total shares, as of the acquisition date. 

Included in the acquired liabilities assumed in
the Day Three Acquisition is a non-interest bearing installment note payable of million. The installment note was recognized by Day
Three in relation to a 2021 asset purchase agreement for certain patents. The assumed installment note payable had a balance of thousand
due January 2024 (which was paid in January 2024) and the remaining million due in November 2024. At October 31, 2024 and July 31,

Company's percentage ownership of Cyclo common stock to approximately at the time of investment. 

William
Conkling, Rafael's CEO, serves on Cyclo s Board of Directors. 

The Company has determined that Cyclo is a VIE;
however, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary as the Company does not have the power to direct the activities
of Cyclo that most significantly impact Cyclo s economic performance and, therefore, is not required to consolidate Cyclo. The Company
has elected to account for its investment in Cyclo under the fair value option, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as unrealized

Hedge funds classified as Level 3 include investments
and securities which may not be based on readily observable data inputs. The availability of observable inputs can vary from security
to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of security, whether the security is new and
not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the security. The fair value
of these assets is estimated based on information provided by the fund managers or the general partners. Therefore, these assets are classified
as Level 3. During the three months ended October 31, 2024, the Company requested a withdrawal
of its remaining balance in Hedge Fund Investments. The Company recognized a realized loss of thousand upon the withdrawal s approval.
The withdrawal, in the amount of million, was not yet funded at October 31, 2024, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

Available-for-sale securities classified as Level
3 include a convertible note receivable, related party (see Note 8) which may not be based
on readily observable data inputs. The availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including,
for example, the type of security, whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and
other characteristics particular to the security. The fair value of this asset is estimated using a scenario-based analysis based on the
probability-weighted present value of future investment returns, considering each of the possible outcomes available to us, including
cash repayment, equity conversion, and collateral transfer scenarios. Estimating the fair value of the convertible note requires the development
of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in
internal and external market factors. Therefore, this asset is classified as Level 3. 

The Company recognizes the fair value of the Cyclo
Warrants utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model Black-Scholes model at acquisition and each reporting
date. The application of the Black-Scholes model utilizes significant assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, marketability
discount and risk-free interest rate. In order to determine the volatility, we measured expected volatility based on several inputs, including
considering a peer group of publicly traded companies and the implied volatility of Cyclo s publicly-traded warrants. As a result of the
unobservable inputs that were used to determine the expected volatility of the Cyclo Warrants, the fair value measurement of these warrants
reflected a Level 3 measurement within the fair value measurement hierarchy. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of
the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The expected volatility is a key assumption or input
to the valuation of the Cyclo Warrants; however, changes in the expected volatility assumption will have less of an effect on the Black-Scholes
model valuation as the Cyclo Warrants approach their expiration. The Cyclo Warrants are subject to limits on exercise and any sales of
the underlying shares of common stock would be subject to volume restrictions for which a discount to the stock price of Cyclo was applied.
The Black-Scholes model further incorporated a discount for the overall lack of marketability for the Cyclo Warrants.

The Company used a scenario-based analysis to
estimate the fair value of the Cyclo Convertible Notes based on the probability-weighted present value of future investment returns, considering
each of the possible outcomes available to the Company, including cash repayment and equity conversion. Estimating the fair values of
the Cyclo Convertible Notes requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over
the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. The four scenarios included maturity, a subsequent
financing, a change in control, and an event of default, whereby total probability of one-hundred percent is allocated across the
four scenarios, at issuance and each subsequent reporting period. With respect to the scenario reflecting maturity of the Cyclo Convertible
Notes, the associated volatility assumption reflects voluntary conversion of the Cyclo Convertible Notes prior to their respective maturities.

In connection with the conversion of Rafael Medical
Devices from a Delaware corporation to a Delaware limited liability company, Rafael Medical Devices adopted the Rafael Medical Devices,
LLC 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the RMD 2023 Plan in August 2023. The RMD 2023 Plan allows for issuance of up to 
Class A Units (the Units ). There were Units available for issuance under the RMD 2023 Plan as of October 31,
2024. 

Rafael Medical Devices, LLC records compensation
expense for stock-based awards based upon an assessment of the grant date fair value for options using the Black-Scholes model. The expected
term was determined according to the simplified method, which is the average of the vesting tranche dates and the contractual term. Due
to the lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data, the estimate of expected volatility is primarily based on the
historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, characteristics from comparable companies
are selected, including enterprise value and position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet
the expected life of the share-based awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity
Treasury rates with remaining maturities similar to the expected term of the options. Expected dividend yield is zero as Rafael Medical
Devices, LLC has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Overview 

Rafael Holdings, Inc. Rafael Holdings ,
 Rafael , we or the Company is a holding company with interests in clinical and early-stage pharmaceutical
companies, including an investment in (and planned Merger with) Cyclo Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:
CYTH), Cyclo Therapeutics or Cyclo ), a clinical stage biotechnology company dedicated to developing Trappsol 
Cyclo , which is being evaluated in clinical trials for the potential treatment of Niemann-Pick Disease Type C1 NPC1 ),
a rare, fatal and progressive genetic disorder, a majority equity interest in LipoMedix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. LipoMedix ),
a clinical stage pharmaceutical company, Barer Institute Inc. Barer ), a wholly-owned preclinical cancer metabolism research
operation, and a majority interest in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Cornerstone ), formerly known as Rafael Pharmaceuticals
Inc., a cancer metabolism-based therapeutics company. We also hold a majority interest in Rafael Medical Devices, LLC Rafael Medical
Devices ), an orthopedic-focused medical device company developing instruments to advance minimally invasive surgeries, and a majority
interest in Day Three Labs, Inc. Day Three ), a company which empowers third-party manufacturers to reimagine their existing
cannabis offerings enabling them to bring to market better, cleaner, more precise and predictable versions by utilizing Day Three s
pharmaceutical-grade technology and innovation like Unlokt . In November 2022, the Company resolved to curtail its early-stage development
efforts, including pre-clinical research at Barer. The decision was taken to reduce spending as the Company focuses on exploring strategic
opportunities. Since then, the Company has sought partners for programs at Farber (as defined below) and has entered into a license agreement
for one of its technologies that is in pre-clinical research stage. The Company s primary focus, to date, has been to expand our
investment portfolio through opportunistic and strategic investments including therapeutics, which address high unmet medical needs. Upon
closing of the planned Merger with Cyclo, the Company intends to focus its efforts on making Trappsol Cyclo its lead clinical
program. In anticipation of that change in strategic focus, the Company is currently evaluating its operating entities (or portfolio of
assets) to ensure the future focus of its resources on core assets and specifically the Trappsol Cyclo clinical
and development efforts. 

Historically,
the Company owned real estate assets. As of October 31, 2024 , the Company holds a portion
of a commercial building in Jerusalem, Israel as its remaining owned real estate asset. 

In May 2023,
the Company first invested in Cyclo Therapeutics. Cyclo is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products
for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Cyclo s lead drug candidate is Trappsol Cyclo (hydroxypropyl
beta cyclodextrin), a treatment for NPC1. NPC1 is a rare and fatal autosomal recessive genetic disease resulting in disrupted cholesterol
metabolism that impacts the brain, lungs, liver, spleen, and other organs. In January 2017 the FDA granted Fast Track designation to Trappsol 
Cyclo for the treatment of NPC1. Initial patient enrollment in the U.S. Phase I study commenced in September 2017, and in May 2020
Cyclo announced Top Line data showing Trappsol Cyclo was well tolerated in this study. Cyclo is currently conducting a Phase
3 Clinical Trial evaluating Trappsol Cyclo in Pediatric and Adult
Patients with Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C1. See Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information
on the Company s investments in Cyclo. 

As discussed in more detail in Note 11 to the
consolidated financial statements, on August 21, 2024, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Cyclo. In the event the Merger
is consummated, the Company intends to fund the TransportNPC phase III clinical trial, evaluating Trappsol Cyclo in Niemann
Pick C, to its interim analysis in the middle of 2025 and focus its efforts on Trappsol Cyclo as its lead clinical
program. At that point, the Company will make a determination as to whether or not to file an NDA for Trappsol Cyclo . 

48 

LipoMedix
is a clinical stage Israeli company focused on the development of a product candidate that holds the potential to be an innovative, safe,
and effective cancer therapy based on liposome delivery. As of July 31, 2024, the Company s ownership interest in LipoMedix was
approximately 95 . LipoMedix has completed various clinical stages of Promitil including
Phase 1A (solid tumors) and 1B (as single agent and in combination with capecitabine and/or bevacizumab in colorectal cancer). Another
phase 1B testing Promitil as radiosensitizer is ongoing and near completion. A total of 149 patients have been treated with Promitil 
as a single agent, or in combination with other anticancer drugs or radiotherapy, under the framework of a Phase 1A and two 1B clinical
studies and under named patient approval for compassionate use. 

In 2019,
the Company established Barer, a preclinical cancer metabolism research operation, to focus on developing a pipeline of novel therapeutic
compounds, including compounds designed to regulate cancer metabolism with potentially broader application in other indications beyond
cancer. Barer was comprised of scientists and academic advisors that are experts in cancer metabolism, chemistry, and drug development.
In addition to its own internal discovery efforts, Barer pursued collaborative research agreements and in-licensing opportunities with
leading scientists from top academic institutions. Barer s majority owned subsidiary, Farber Partners, LLC Farber ),
was formed around one such agreement with Princeton University s Office of Technology Licensing Princeton for technology
from the laboratory of Professor Joshua Rabinowitz, in the Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, for an exclusive worldwide license
to its SHMT (serine hydroxymethyltransferase) inhibitor program. In November 2022, the Company resolved
to curtail its early-stage development efforts, including pre-clinical research at Barer Institute. Since then, the Company has
sought partners for Farber programs and has entered into a license agreement for one of its technologies that is in pre-clinical research
stage. 

The Company owns a 37.5 equity interest in RP
Finance LLC RP Finance ), which was, until March 13, 2024 (the date of the RP Finance Consolidation, as described in Note
3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), accounted for under the equity method. RP Finance is an entity associated with members of
the family of Howard Jonas (Executive Chairman, Chairman of the Board, and controlling stockholder of the Company) which holds 37.5 equity
interest of RP Finance. RP Finance holds debt and equity investments in Cornerstone. In October 2021, Cornerstone received negative results
of its Avenger 500 Phase 3 study for Devimistat in pancreatic cancer as well as a recommendation to stop its ARMADA 2000 Phase 3 study
due to a determination that the trial would unlikely achieve its primary endpoint (the Data Events ). Due to the Data Events,
RP Finance fully impaired its then debt and equity investments in Cornerstone. 

On March 13, 2024, Cornerstone consummated a restructuring
of its outstanding debt and equity interests (the Cornerstone Restructuring ). As a result of the Cornerstone Restructuring,
Rafael became a 67 owner of the issued and outstanding common stock of Cornerstone (the Cornerstone Acquisition ), and Cornerstone
became a consolidated subsidiary of Rafael. The Cornerstone Acquisition is accounted for as an acquisition of a variable interest entity
that is not a business in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company was determined to be the accounting acquirer for financial reporting
purposes. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the transaction. In conjunction with
the Cornerstone Restructuring and Cornerstone Acquisition, the Company reassessed its relationship with RP Finance, and as a result determined
that RP Finance is still a variable interest entity and that the Company became the primary beneficiary of RP Finance as the Company now
holds the ability to control repayment of the RP Finance Line of Credit which directly impacts RP Finance s economic performance.
Therefore, following the Cornerstone Restructuring and Cornerstone Acquisition, the Company consolidated RP Finance (the RP Finance
Consolidation ). See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements f or
additional information on the Consolidation. The Company is currently reviewing Cornerstone s current efforts, prospects and available
resources to determine the optimal operational direction. 

In May 2021, the Company formed Rafael Medical
Devices, an orthopedic-focused medical device company developing instruments to advance minimally invasive surgeries. In August 2023,
the Company raised 925,000 from third parties in exchange for 31.6 ownership of Rafael Medical Devices. 

In April 2023, the Company first invested in Day
Three, a company which empowers third-party manufacturers to reimagine their existing cannabis offerings enabling them to bring to market
better, cleaner, more precise and predictable versions by utilizing Day Three s pharmaceutical-grade technology and innovation like
Unlokt . In January 2024, the Company entered into a series of transactions with Day Three and certain shareholders, acquiring a
controlling interest of Day Three and subsequently consolidating Day Three s results (the Day Three Acquisition ). The Company
is evaluating the prospects for Day Three s technology and offerings.

Capital Resources 

As of October 31, 2024, we held cash and
cash equivalents of approximately 8.2 million and available-for-sale securities valued at approximately 46.1 million. The Company expects
its balance of cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities, to be sufficient to meet our obligations for at least the
next 12 months from the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Operating Activities 

Cash used in operating activities increased by
 0.9 million from cash used of 2.1 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023 to cash used of 3.0 million for the three months
ended October 31, 2024, due to the increase in the net loss partially offset by the impact from non-cash items and changes in assets and
liabilities. 

52 

Investing Activities 

Cash provided by investing activities for the
three months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily due to proceeds of 33.3 million from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities,
partially offset by purchases of available-for-sale securities of approximately 15.7 million and the issuance of 9.0 million in convertible
notes due from Cyclo. 

Cash used in investing activities for the three
months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to purchases of available-for-sale securities of approximately 47.5 million, the purchase
of investment in Cyclo of 6.8 million, and the loan of 0.3 million to Day Three. This is partially offset by proceeds of 47.5 million
from the sale and maturities of available-for-sale securities and proceeds of 0.3 million from the sale of equity securities. 

Financing Activities 

Cash used in financing activities for the three
months ended October 31, 2024 was related to a payment for taxes related to shares withheld for employee taxes of 50 thousand. 

Cash provided by financing activities for the
three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily related to the proceeds from sale of RMD membership units of 0.9 million. 

We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common
stock until we achieve sustainable profitability and retain certain minimum cash reserves. The payment of dividends in any specific period
will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We have chosen accounting policies that we believe
are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We apply these
accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

The application of critical accounting policies
requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related
disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation. If actual
results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual
amounts become known. The critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation
of our consolidated financial statements, or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors, are discussed in the Critical Accounting
Estimates section in Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024. There were no material changes during the three months
ended October 31, 2024 to the Critical Accounting Estimates previously disclosed. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, 
as defined in relevant SEC regulations, that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results
of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

53 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risks 

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK 

Revenue from tenants located in Israel represented
60 and 100 of our consolidated revenues for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The entirety of these revenues
is in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our foreign currency exchange risk is somewhat mitigated by our ability to offset a portion
of these non-U.S. Dollar-denominated revenues with operating expenses that are paid in the same currencies. While the impact from fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates affects our revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, the net amount of our exposure to foreign
currency exchange rate changes at the end of each reporting period is generally not material. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was performed under the supervision
and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated
under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of October 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s
management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no significant changes made in the
Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

54 

Part II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

Legal proceedings disclosure is presented in Note
22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 to Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

previously disclosed in Item 1A to Part I of the 2024 Form 10-K.
