United States 

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

2018-2020 tax years. Moreover, the CARES Act also temporarily increases the business interest deduction limitations from 30 to 50 of
adjusted taxable income for the 2019 and 2020 taxable year. Lastly, the Tax Act technical correction classifies qualified improvement
property as 15-year recovery period, allowing the bonus depreciation deduction to be claimed for such property retroactively as if it
was included in the Tax Act at the time of enactment. The Company does not anticipate a significant tax impact on its financial statements
and will continue to examine the impact the CARES Act may have on its business.

provides for a foreign tax credit in connection with the foreign taxes paid. In 2019, the Company recorded a GILTI inclusion of .
The Company has elected to treat the financial statement impact of GILTI as current period expenses.

In accordance with the relevant tax laws and regulations
of the PRC, a company registered in the PRC is subject to income taxes within the PRC at the applicable tax rate on taxable income. All
the PRC subsidiaries were subject to income tax at a rate of 25 for the year ended December 31, 2022. According to PRC tax regulations,
the PRC net operating loss can generally carry forward for no longer than five years starting from the year subsequent to the year in
which the loss was incurred. 

Taiwan 

The Company s loss
before income taxes is primarily derived from the operations in Taiwan and income tax expense is primarily incurred in Taiwan. 

As a result of
amendments to the Taiwan Income Tax Act enacted by the Office of the President of Taiwan on February 7, 2018, the
statutory income tax rate increased from 17 to 20 and the undistributed earning tax, or a surtax, decreased from
10 to 5 effective from January 1, 2018. As a result, the statutory income tax rate in Taiwan is 20 for the years
ended August 31, 2021 and 2020. An additional surtax, of which rate was reduced from 10 to 5 being applied to the
Company starting from September 1, 2018, is assessed on undistributed income for the entities in Taiwan, but only to the extent such
income is not distributed or set aside as a legal reserve before the end of the following year. The 5 surtax is recorded in
the period the income is earned, and the reduction in the surtax liability is recognized in the period the distribution to
stockholders or the setting aside of legal reserve is finalized in the following year. 

The components of the income tax expense are: 

Deferred 

Total income tax expense 

The reconciliation of income taxes expenses computed
at the Taiwan statutory tax rate (2021: at PRC statutory rate) applicable to income tax expense is as follows: 

Tax effect of non-deductible expenses 

Tax effect of stock-based compensation 

Tax effect of non-taxable income 

Impact of different tax rates in other jurisdictions 

Others 

Changes in valuation allowance 

Effective tax rate 

3) Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net 

The tax effects of temporary differences representing
deferred income tax assets and liabilities result principally from the following: 

Allowance for doubtful receivables 

Total deferred tax assets 

Reversal of deferred tax assets 

Valuation allowance 

Total deferred tax assets, net 

June 30, 2024 
 December 31, 2023 

Deferred tax liabilities 

Property and equipment, difference in depreciation 

Deferred tax liabilities, net 

The valuation allowance as of June 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023 was primarily provided for the deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will expire
before the Company is able to realize its benefits, or that the future deductibility is uncertain. The ultimate realization of deferred
income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible or utilizable. Management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
The movement for the valuation allowance is as follows. 

Additions of valuation allowance 

Reductions of valuation allowance 

Balance at the end of the year 

PRC Withholding Tax on Dividends 

The current PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law imposes
a 10 withholding income tax for dividends distributed by foreign-invested enterprises to their immediate holding companies outside the
PRC. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between the PRC and the jurisdiction of the foreign
holding company. Distributions to holding companies in Hong Kong that satisfy certain requirements specified by PRC tax authorities, for
example, will be subject to a 5 withholding tax rate. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not recorded
any withholding tax on the retained earnings of its foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC, since the Company had intended to reinvest
its earnings to potentially continue its business in mainland China, namely the manufacturing of the RASs through GZ GST, and its foreign-invested
enterprises do not intend to declare dividends to their immediate foreign holding companies. 

As of June 30, 2023, the Company had not recorded
any withholding tax on the retained earnings of its foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC, and the Company decided not to reinvest its
earnings since it is not continuing its business in mainland China, and its foreign-invested enterprises do not intend to declare dividends
to their immediate foreign holding companies.

under the following assumptions: 

Expected term (in years) 

Volatility 

The Company estimated the grant date fair value
of time-based stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which requires assumptions involving an estimate of
the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, the expected term of the options, volatility, discount rate and dividend
yield. The Company calculated expected option terms based on the simplified method for plain vanilla options
due to the limited exercise information. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the vesting
term and the original contractual term of the options. The Company calculated volatility using the average adjusted volatility of quick
companies feature of Capital IQ for a period of time reflective of the expected option term, while the discount rate was estimated using
the interest rate for a treasury note with the same contractual term as the options granted. Dividend yield is estimated at our current
dividend rate, which adjusts for any known future changes in the rate.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related
notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). In addition, our unaudited consolidated financial
statements and the financial data included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflect our reorganization and have been prepared as
if our current corporate structure had been in place throughout the relevant periods. Actual results could differ materially from those
projected in the forward-looking statements. For additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties, please see
the items listed under the section captioned Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements herein and
the section captioned Risk Factors as well as any other cautionary language contained in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. Except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation
to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Operations Overview 

As of December 31, 2019, we provide land-based
recirculation aquaculture systems for fish farming. Our primary business operations consist of the design, development and production
of RASs large scale fish tank systems, for fish farms along with expert consulting, technology transfer and aquaculture project management
services to new and existing aquaculture management business services. Through our branch office, we also procure and sell eel in Taiwan.
In addition, as of December 2022, we sell food items, including our signature seafood porridge bowl, through our flagship bento box store
located at the Ning Xia Night Market in the Datong District of Taipei City, Taiwan. 

In October 2020, the government of Taiwan began
supporting the Green Power and Solar Sharing Fish Farms initiative. In view of the opportunities resulting from this initiative, in October
2020, Nocera ceased all of its operations in China and moved all of its technology and back-office operations to Taiwan. We now only operate
out of Taiwan. 

Our current mission is to provide consulting services
and solutions in aquaculture projects to reduce water pollution and decrease the disease problems of fisheries. Our goal is to become
a global leader in the land-based aquaculture business. We are now poised to grow our existing operations in Taiwan and expand into the
development and management of land-based fish farms in Taiwan and North and South America. We do not currently have any intentions of
conducting operations in China or Hong Kong. 

Effective December 31, 2020, we entered into a
series of contractual agreements with Xin Feng Construction Co., Ltd., a funded limited liability company registered in Taiwan (R.O.C.),
whereby we agreed to provide technical consulting and related services to XFC. On November 30, 2022, we entered into a Purchase of Business
Agreement with Han-Chieh Shih, in which we sold our controlling interest of XFC, to the Purchaser for a total purchase cash price of 300,000.
The closing of the XFC Sale occurred on November 30, 2022 and the XFC VIE agreements were terminated in connection with the XFC Sale.
As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have no intention of providing services to construct indoor RASs and solar
sharing fish farms in Taiwan. 

As of September 30, 2021, we launched our first
RAS demo site in Taiwan and engaged the demo site into the testing phase to raise eel. Currently, we are promoting our RASs in Taiwan
and looking for opportunities to cooperate with local solar energy industry and to expand our business into the U.S. We believe the U.S.
is a potentially lucrative market to penetrate. 

On September 7, 2022, we entered into a series
of contractual agreements with the majority stockholder of Meixin Institutional Food Development Co., Ltd., a Taiwan corporation and a
food processing and catering company, and Meixin, of which we purchased 80 controlling interest of Meixin for 4,300,000. The Meixin
VIE Agreements essentially confer control and management of Meixin as well as substantially all of the economic benefits of the Selling
Stockholder in Meixin to us. As a result, we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary of Meixin and Meixin became our VIE. 

25 

On June 1, 2023, Gui Zhou Grand Smooth Technology
Ltd. GZ GST ), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into that certain Share Purchase Agreement dated as of June
1, 2023, as amended, with Zhe Jiang Xin Shui Hu Digital Information, Ltd. Zhe Jiang ), pursuant to which GZ GST acquired
all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Zhe Jiang from the stockholders of Zhe Jiang (the Zhe Jiang Acquisition in exchange for the issuance of 1,500,000 shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share. During the initial transaction process
and our performing due diligence for the closing, we observed that time constraints have led to certain complexities and challenges in
consummating the Acquisition within the originally planned timeframe. We are actively working with Zhe Jiang to resolve such complexities
and challenges and will file a Current Report on Form 8-K if and when the Zhe Jiang Acquisition is consummated. 

On January 31, 2024, we entered into a Variable
Interest Entity Purchase Agreement Xinca Purchase Agreement with Zhejiang Xinca Mutual Entertainment Culture Media Co.,
Ltd. Xinca ), a domestic funded limited liability company registered in China (P.R.C). The Xinca Purchase Agreement was
entered into by our wholly-owned subsidiary and foreign enterprise, Shanghai Nocera Culture Co., Ltd. WFOE ), through a
series of contractual agreements VIE Agreements ), in which we exchanged 1,800,000 shares of our restricted common stock
for a 100 controlling interest in Xinca. As a result, the Company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of Xinca and Xinca
became a variable interest entity VIE of the Company. 

On April 14, 2024, we entered into a Variable
Interest Entity Purchase Agreement SY Media Purchase Agreement with Hangzhou SY Culture Media Co. Ltd. SY Culture ),
a domestic funded limited liability company registered in China (P.R.C). The SY Culture Purchase Agreement was entered into by our wholly-owned
subsidiary and foreign enterprise, Gui Zhou Grand Smooth Technology Ltd. WFOE ), through a series of contractual agreements VIE Agreements ), in which we exchanged 600,000 shares of our restricted common stock for a 100 controlling interest in
SY Culture. As a result, the Company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of SY Culture and SY Culture became a variable
interest entity VIE of the Company. 

We employ a sales and marketing strategy targeting
Taiwan government-supported solar fish farms. We are planning on expanding our sales and marketing model through the use of online marketing,
data intelligence, and the establishment of a distributor network. The online marketing and data intelligence is designed to generate
sales leads internationally outside of Taiwan that can be directed to our sales department for further follow-up. 

We plan to sell and develop fish farms in Taiwan,
the U.S. and Brazil. We expect to sell over five thousand tanks in the next five years. Our production facility is to be established in
Taiwan, and we plan to sell the systems into the Americas and European countries as well. 

We also intend to expend the fish farming demo
sites in Taiwan by adding 20 units of RAS eel farming equipment with outsourcing construction services and build the catfish farm in the
U.S. by the end of 2024 to promote our fish farming systems to the global market. We are expecting more customers from various countries
actively inquiring about our equipment. As of February 16, 2023, we completed the acquisition of 229 acres of land in Montgomery County,
Alabama, of which we intend to build RASs on that land for fish farming. As of June 30, 2024, we are still ensuring all requirements and
evaluations are being thoroughly addressed prior to constructing any RASs on the Alabama land. Simultaneously, the design of the RAS equipment
is underway, progressing in alignment with the project s timeline. Both aspects are being managed concurrently to maintain project
efficiency and coherence. We plan to enhance market penetration through the establishment of our own fish farms and diversify revenue
streams through various sales channels. 

Key Factors Affecting our Performance 

As a result of a number of factors, our historical
results of operations may not be comparable to our results of operations in future periods, and our results of operations may not be directly
comparable from period to period. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors impacting our results of operations. 

26 

Known Trends and Uncertainties 

Inflation 

Prices of certain commodity products, including
raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and
demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, trade restrictions and tariffs. Increasing prices in the
component materials for our goods may impact the availability, the quality and the price of our products, as suppliers search for alternatives
to existing materials and increase the prices they charge. Our suppliers may also fail to provide consistent quality of product as they
may substitute lower cost materials to maintain pricing levels. Nocera s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight,
including fuel, which significantly increased due to the effects of coronavirus (COVID-19), Russia s illegal military invasion of
Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices such as fuel and plastic may negatively
affect our profit margins if Nocera is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost
reduction initiatives. 

Geopolitical Conditions 

Our operations could be disrupted by geopolitical
conditions, trade disputes, international boycotts and sanctions, political and social instability, acts of war, terrorist activity or
other similar events. From time to time, we could have a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or a large number
of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific customer, industry,
or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations. 

In February 2022, Russia initiated significant
military action against Ukraine. Russia s invasion, the responses of countries and political bodies to Russia s actions, and
the potential for wider conflict may increase financial market volatility and could have adverse effects on regional and global economic
markets, including the markets for certain securities and commodities. Following Russia s actions, various countries, including
the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and France, as well as the European Union, issued broad-ranging economic sanctions
against Russia. The sanctions consist of the prohibition of trading in certain Russian securities and engaging in certain private transactions,
the prohibition of doing business with certain Russian corporate entities, large financial institutions, officials and persons and the
freezing of Russian assets. The sanctions include a possible commitment by certain countries and the European Union to remove selected
Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, commonly called SWIFT, the electronic
network that connects banks globally, and imposed restrictive measures to prevent the Russian Central Bank from undermining the impact
of the sanctions. A number of large corporations and U.S. states have also announced plans to curtail business dealings with certain Russian
businesses. 

The imposition of the current sanctions (and potential
imposition of further sanctions in response to continued Russian military activity) and other actions undertaken by countries and businesses
may adversely impact various sectors of the Russian economy, and the military action has severe impacts on the Ukrainian economy, including
its exports and food production. The duration of ongoing hostilities and corresponding sanctions and related events cannot be predicted
and may result in a negative impact on the markets and thereby may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of
operation. 

In addition, while we do not have any direct operations
or significant sales in the Middle East, geopolitical tensions and ongoing conflicts in the region, particularly between Israel and Hamas,
may lead to global economic instability and fluctuating energy prices that could materially affect our business. It is not possible to
predict the broader consequences of the Israel-Hamas war, including related geopolitical tensions, and the measures and actions taken
by other countries in respect thereof, which could materially adversely affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional economies
and the global economy. While it is difficult to predict the impact of any of the foregoing, the Israel-Hamas war may increase our costs,
disrupt our supply chain, reduce our sales and earnings, impair our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms,
if at all, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

27 

Foreign Currency 

Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and
our operations in Taiwan use their local currency as their functional currencies. Substantially all of our revenue and expenses are in
NT dollars. We are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations with respect to any of such currency. For example, the value of
the NT dollar depends to a large extent on Taiwan government policies and Taiwan s domestic and international economic and political
developments, as well as supply and demand in the local market. 

The income statements of our operations are translated
into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies,
the translation of these foreign currencies denominated transactions results in reduced revenue, operating expenses and net income for
our international operations. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our
foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. 

Effects of COVID-19 

COVID-19 has globally resulted in the loss of
life, business closures, restrictions on travel and widespread cancellation of social gatherings. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts
our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including: 

new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the disease; 

the duration and spread of any future COVID-19 outbreaks; 

the severity of travel restrictions imposed by geographic areas in which we operate, mandatory or voluntary business closures, if any; 

regulatory actions taken in response to any future COVID-19 outbreaks which may impact merchant operations, consumer and merchant pricing, and our product offerings; 

other business disruptions that affect our workforce; 

the impact on capital and financial markets; and 

actions taken throughout the world, including in markets in which we operate, to contain any future COVID-19 outbreak or treat its impact. 

In addition, any future outbreak of COVID-19 may
result in a widespread global health crisis and adversely affected global economies and financial markets, and similar public health threats
could do so in the future. 

Since 2021, substantially all our revenues are
concentrated in Taiwan pending expansion into other international markets. Consequently, our results of operations will likely be adversely
materially affected to the extent that any COVID-19 outbreak or any epidemic harms Taiwan s economy and society and the global economy
in general. Any potential impact to our results will depend on to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge
regarding the duration and severity of any future COVID-19 outbreak and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities
to contain any future COVID-19 outbreak or treat its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control. If the disruptions posed by any
future COVID-19 outbreak or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, the operations of our business may
be materially adversely affected. 

28 

To the extent any future COVID-19 outbreak or
a similar public health threat has an impact on our business, it is likely to also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks
described in the Risk Factors section in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2023 initially filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. 

Seasonality 

Since the global growing demand for aquaculture
production along with the decreasing production from wild fisheries, our fish farming systems provide a controlled and traceable environment
for fish species, and therefore our business rarely suffers a seasonal impact. 

Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions 

We prepare our financial statements in conformity
with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the financial reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information,
our own historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use
of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our
accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We consider the policies discussed below to be
critical to an understanding of our financial statements. 

The SEC defines critical accounting policies as
those that are, in management s view, most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and those
that require significant judgments and estimates. 

The accounting principles we utilized in preparing
our consolidated financial statements conform in all material respects to GAAP. 

Reclassification 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified
to conform with current year presentation. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the allowance for doubtful
receivables; the useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets; impairment of long-lived assets; recoverability of the
carrying amount of inventory; fair value of financial instruments; provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates for certain income
tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act and the assessment of deferred tax assets or liabilities. These estimates
are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

29 

Financial Assets 

The classification of financial assets depends
on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales
of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified
in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets
within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace. 

a) Category
of financial assets and measurement 

Financial assets are classified into
the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets
at amortized cost. 

1) 
 Financial asset at FVTPL 

For certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset. 

2) 
 Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI 

Debt instruments with contractual terms specifying
 that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of collecting
 contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, are measured at FVTOCI. 
 
 Interest income calculated using the effective
 interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment gains or losses on investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are recognized
 in profit or loss. Other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and will
 be reclassified to profit or loss when these debt instruments are disposed. 

3) 
 Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI 

On initial recognition, we may irrevocably designate
 investments in equity investments that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI. 
 
 Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are
 subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income
 and accumulated in other equity. 
 
 Dividends on these investments in equity instruments
 at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss when our right to receive the dividends is established, unless our rights clearly represent
 a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. 

30 

4) 
 Measured at amortized cost 

Cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper, debt
 instrument investments, notes and accounts receivable (including related parties), other receivables, refundable deposits and temporary
 payments (including those classified under other current assets and other noncurrent assets) are measured at amortized cost. 
 
 Debt instruments with contractual terms specifying
 that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of holding
 financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, are measured at amortized cost. 
 
 Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets
 measured at amortized cost are measured at amortized cost, which equals to carrying amount determined by the effective interest method
 less any impairment loss. 

b) Impairment
of financial assets 

At the end of each reporting period,
a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for
investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI. 

The loss allowance for accounts receivable
is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments
that are measured at FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition,
a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial instrument
within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition,
a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the expected
life of a financial instrument. 

We recognize an impairment loss in profit
or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account, except
for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, for which the loss allowance is recognized in other comprehensive income
and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset. 

c) Derecognition
of financial assets 

We derecognize a financial asset only
when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another entity. 

On derecognition of a financial asset
at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the asset s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received
and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between
the asset s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been
recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument
at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings,
without recycling through profit or loss. 

Fair Value Measurement 

We apply ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement disclosure
requirements for fair value measurements. 

31 

ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price
that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) on the measurement date in an orderly
transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. 

ASC Topic 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation
techniques, which is based on whether the inputs into the valuation technique are observable or unobservable. The hierarchy is as follows: 

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments. 

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value. Unobservable inputs are valuation technique inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 

Our management is responsible for determining
the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangibles identified as of the acquisition date and considered a number of factors including
valuations from an independent appraiser. 

When available, we use quoted market prices to
determine the fair value of an asset or liability. If quoted market prices are not available, we measure fair value using valuation techniques
that use, when possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates and currency rates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash on
hand and cash in bank with no restrictions. The balance of cash as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 were 586,424 and 1,116,183, respectively. 

Accounts Receivable, Net 

Accounts receivable are stated at the original
amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts, if any, based on a review of all outstanding amounts at period end. An allowance is also
made when there is objective evidence that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
We analyze the aging of the customer accounts, coverage of credit insurance, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, historical
and current economic trends and changes in its customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets, Net 

Prepaid expense and other assets, net consist
of receivable from prepaid rent, etc. Management reviews its receivable balance each reporting period to determine if an allowance for
doubtful accounts is required. An allowance for doubtful account is recorded in the period in which loss is determined to be probable
based on an assessment of specific evidence indicating doubtful collection, historical experience, account balance aging, and prevailing
economic conditions. Bad debts are written off against the allowance after all collection efforts have ceased. 

32 

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at lower of cost or net
realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Inventories include raw materials, work in progress and finished
goods. The variable production overhead is allocated to each unit of product on the basis of the actual use of the production facilities.
The allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. 

Where there is evidence that the utility of inventories,
in their disposal in the ordinary course of business, will be less than cost, whether due to physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes
in price levels, or other causes, the inventories are written down to net realizable value. 

Property and Equipment, Net 

Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Cost represents the purchase price of the asset and other costs incurred to bring the asset into its existing
use. Maintenance, repairs, and betterments, including replacement of minor items, are charged to expense; major additions to physical
properties are capitalized. 

Depreciation of property and equipment is provided
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which are shown as follows. 

Useful life 
 
 Leasehold improvements 
 Shorter of the remaining lease terms and estimated useful lives 
 
 Land 
 Indefinite, as per land titles 
 
 Furniture and fixture 
 5 years 
 
 Equipment 
 3 years 
 
 Machinery 
 5 years 
 
 Vehicle 
 5 years 

Upon sale or disposal, the applicable amounts
of asset cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount less proceeds from disposal is charged or
credited to income. 

Business Combination 

For a business combination, the assets acquired,
the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized at the acquisition date and measured at their fair
values as of that date. In a business combination achieved in stages, the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree, are recognized at the full amounts of their fair values. In a bargain purchase in which the total acquisition-date
fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest
in the acquiree, that excess in earnings is recognized as a gain attributable to the acquirer. 

Deferred tax liability and assets are recognized
for the deferred tax consequences of differences between the tax bases and the recognized values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 740-10. 

33 

Variable Interest Entity 

A variable interest entity VIE is an entity (investee) in which the investor has obtained a controlling interest even if it has less than a majority of voting rights,
according to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). A VIE is subject to consolidation if a VIE meets one of the following three
criteria as elaborated in ASC Topic 810-10, Consolidation: 

(a) 
 equity-at-risk is not sufficient to support the entity s activities; 

(b) 
 as a group, the equity-at-risk holders cannot control the entity; or 

(c) 
 the economics do not coincide with the voting interest. 

If a firm is the primary beneficiary of a VIE,
the holdings must be disclosed on the balance sheet. The primary beneficiary is defined as the person or company with the majority of
variable interests. A corporation formed, owned, and operated by two or more businesses (ventures) as a separate and discrete business
or project (venture) for their mutual benefit is defined as a joint venture. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

We recognize goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill
and Other . Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed
in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1st of each year, and is
tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
An impairment charge for goodwill is recognized only when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less than
its carrying amount. 

We recognize intangible assets in accordance with
ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . Acquired intangible assets subject to amortization are stated at cost and are
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization
are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Assets not
subject to amortization are tested for impairment at least annually. 

The estimates of fair value are based on the best
information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash
flows. Although these assets are not currently impaired, there can be no assurance that future impairments will not occur. 

Share-Based Compensation 

We determine our share-based compensation in accordance
with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation (ASC 718), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees based on the grant date fair value of the award. 

Determining the appropriate fair value model and
calculating the fair value of phantom award grants requires the input of subjective assumptions. We use the Black-Scholes pricing model
to value our phantom awards. Share-based compensation expense is calculated using our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties
and the application of management s judgment. Significant estimates include our expected volatility. If different estimates and
assumptions had been used, our phantom unit valuations could be significantly different and related share-based compensation expense may
be materially impacted. 

34 

The Black-Scholes pricing model requires inputs
such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected volatility and expected dividend yield. We base the risk-free interest rate
that we use in the Black-Scholes pricing model on zero coupon U.S. Treasury instruments with maturities similar to the expected term of
the award being valued. The expected term of phantom awards is estimated from the vesting period of the award and represents the weighted
average period that our phantom awards are expected to be outstanding. We estimated the volatility based on the historic volatility of
our guideline companies, which we feel best represent our Company. We have never paid and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends
in the foreseeable future and, therefore, we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the pricing model. We account for forfeitures as
they occur. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair presentation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
position as of June 30, 2024, consolidated results of operations for the period ended June 30, 2024, cash flows for the year period ended
June 30, 2024 and change in equity for the period ended June 30, 2024, as applicable, have been made. 

Critical accounting policies are those that we
consider the most critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. 

Impairment of Long-lived Assets 

We review our long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may no longer be recoverable. When these events
occur, we measure impairment by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows
expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flow is less
than the carrying amount of the assets, we would recognize an impairment loss, which is the excess of carrying amount over the fair value
of the assets. 

Commitments and Contingencies 

In the normal course of business, we are subject
to contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business that relate to a wide range of matters, such as government
investigations and tax matters. We recognize a liability for such contingency if we determine it is probable that a loss has occurred
and a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made. We may consider many factors in making these assessments including historical and the
specific facts and circumstances of each matter. 

Revenue Recognition 

We have early adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and all subsequent ASUs that modified ASC 606 on January 1, 2017. 

The core principle of the guidance is that an
entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, we apply the following
steps: 

Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer 

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract 

Step 3: Determine the transaction price 

Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract 

Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation 

35 

We considered revenue is recognized when (or as)
we satisfy performance obligations by transferring a promised goods and provide maintenance service to a customer. Revenue is measured
at the transaction price which is based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for transferring the promised
goods and providing maintenance service to the customer. Contracts with customers are comprised of invoices, and written contracts. 

We do not have arrangements for returns from customers.
We have no sales incentive programs. 

We provide goods, maintenance service warranties
for the goods sold with a period varying from 18 months to 72 months, with the majority of the periods being 18 months, and exclusive
sales agency license to its customers. For performance obligation related to providing products, we expect to recognize the revenue according
to the delivery of products. For performance obligation related to maintenance service warranties, we expect to recognize the revenue
on a ratable basis using a time-based output method. The performance obligations are typically satisfied as services are rendered on a
straight-line basis over the contract term, which is generally for 18 months as a majority of the maintenance service warranties periods
provided are 18 months. For performance obligation related to exclusive agency license, we recognize the revenue ratably upon the satisfaction
over the estimated economic life of the license. 

We do not have amounts of contract assets since
revenue is recognized as control of goods is transferred. The contract liabilities consist of advance payments from customers and deferred
revenue. Advance payments from customers are expected to be recognized as revenue within 12 months. Deferred revenue is expected to be
recognized as revenue within 12 months. 

Cost of Sales 

Cost of sales consists primarily of material costs,
labor costs, depreciation, and related expenses, which are directly attributable to the production of the product. Write-down of inventories
to lower of cost or net realizable value is also recorded in cost of sales. 

Income Taxes 

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method,
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates, applicable to the periods
in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

Leases 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,
Leases (ASC Topic 842), which amends the lease requirements in ASC Topic 840, Leases. Under the new lease accounting standard, a lessee
will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for most leases on the balance sheet. The new standard also modifies
the classification criteria and accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases, and enhances the disclosure requirements. Leases
will continue to be classified as either finance or operating leases. 

We adopted ASC Topic 842 using the modified retrospective
transition method effective January 1, 2019. There was no cumulative effect of initially applying ASC Topic 842 that required an adjustment
to the opening retained earnings on the adoption date nor revision of the balances in comparative periods. As a result of the adoption,
we recognized a lease liability and right-of-use asset for each of our existing lease arrangement. The adoption of the new lease standard
does not have a material impact on our consolidated income statement or our consolidated statement of cash flow. 

36 

Uncertain Tax Positions 

We account for uncertainty in income taxes using
a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition
by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit,
including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest
amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized
and recorded as necessary in the provision for income taxes. According to the PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law, the statute of
limitations is three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to computational errors made by the taxpayer or the withholding agent.
The statute of limitations is extended to five years under special circumstances, where the underpayment of taxes is more than RMB 100,000.
In the case of transfer pricing issues, the statute of limitation is ten years. There is no statute of limitation in the case of tax evasion.
We record interest and penalties on uncertain tax provisions as income tax expense. There were no uncertain tax positions as of June 30,
2024 and 2023, and we have no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. We do not believe that the unrecognized
tax benefits will change over the next twelve months. 

Comprehensive (Loss) Income 

Comprehensive income or loss is comprised of the
our net (loss) income and other comprehensive income or loss. The component of other comprehensive income or loss consists solely of foreign
currency translation adjustments, net of the income tax effect. 

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions 

Our reporting currency is the United States dollar US ). The functional currency of our VIE in Taiwan is the New Taiwan dollar NT ), and the functional currency
of our Hong Kong subsidiary is Hong Kong dollars HK ). The functional currency of PRC companies is the Renminbi RMB ).
In the consolidated financial statements, the financial information of our subsidiary and the consolidated VIE has been translated into
US . Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date, equity amounts are translated at historical
exchange rates, except for changes in accumulated deficit during the year which is the result of income statement translation process,
and revenue, expense, gains or losses are translated using the average exchange rate during the year. Translation adjustments are reported
as foreign currency translation adjustments and are shown as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss in the consolidated
statements of changes in equity and comprehensive (loss) income. The exchange rates as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 are 7.1268 and 7.2258,
respectively. The annual average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are 7.0423 and 6.7208, respectively. 

(Loss) Earnings per Share 

Basic (loss) earnings per share is computed by
dividing net (loss) income attributable to holders of common stock by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the year. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses were 308,795,
for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to approximately 368,667 for the comparable period in 2023. This increase was primarily
due to the increase of audit fees, consulting fees, and salary expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 

General and administrative expenses were 884,406,
for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to approximately 1,428,004 for the comparable period in 2023. This decrease was primarily
due to the decrease of consulting fees for the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

Other expense 

Other income was 16,136, for the three months
ended June 30, 2024, compared to other expense of 880 for the comparable period in 2023. The other income was interest revenue of bank
deposits. The other expense was interest expense for a bank loan. The increase was mainly the effect of interest expense recognized for
the three months ended June 30, 2023. 

Other income was 13,866, for the six months ended

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we
recorded an income tax expense of 122,380 compared to income tax expense of nil for the comparable period in 2023. The increase of
income tax expense is because we evaluated the income tax impact for the period ended June 30, 2024. 

39 

Net income attributable to the Company 

Net loss attributable to us (excluding net loss
attributable to non-controlling interest) for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 354,278 compared to net loss attributable to us
(excluding net loss attributable to non-controlling interest) of 311,374 for the comparable period in 2023. Margins remained similar
profit margin for three months ended June 30, 2024. 

Net loss attributable to the Company (excluding
net loss attributable to non-controlling interest) for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 840,698, compared to a net loss attributable
to the Company (excluding net loss attributable to non-controlling interest) of 1,299,022 for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease
was primarily due to the decrease of General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company had net cash used by operating activities
for the period ended June 30, 2023 and the cash balance was 586,424 as of June 30, 2024 and stockholders equity of 803,618. The
Company believes its current cash balances coupled with anticipated cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its
working capital requirements for at least one year from the date of issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The
Company continues to control its cash expenses as a percentage of expected revenue on an annual basis and thus may use its cash balances
in the short-term to invest in revenue growth. Based on current internal projections, the Company believes it has and/or will generate
sufficient cash for its operational needs, for at least one year from the date of issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. Management is also focused on growing the Company s existing product offering, as well as its customer base, to increase
its revenues. The Company cannot give assurance that it can increase its cash balances or limit its cash consumption and thus maintain
sufficient cash balances for its planned operations or future acquisitions. Future business demands may lead to cash utilization at levels
greater than recently experienced. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future. However, the Company cannot assure
that it will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. Subject to the foregoing, management believes that the
Company has sufficient capital and liquidity to fund its operations for at least one year from the date of issuance of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. 

 To
 date, we have funded our operations through revenues, loans from our officers, and the issuance
 of equity securities. 

As of June 30, 2024, we reported a net asset balance
of 803,618. There remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to several factors, including the potential
delisting of our securities, the excess of current liabilities over current assets, and the substantial deficits in operating cash flow
compared to our available cash balance. 

The following table provides detailed information
about our net cash flows for the periods indicated: 

For the six months ended June 30,

Net cash used in operating activities 

Net cash used in operating activities amounted
to 658,042 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. This reflected a net loss of 863,172, depreciation of 54,529 and share-based compensation
of 30,165.

Net cash used in operating activities amounted
to 649,888 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This reflected a net loss of 1,334,501, consultancy services settled by equities
of 521,100, depreciation of 81,608 and share-based compensation of 132,955. 

Net cash used in investing activities 

Net cash provided by investing activities was
 212,007 for the year ended June 30, 2024, which were primarily attributable to the proceeds from disposal of financial assets at fair
value through profit and loss. 

Net cash used in investing activities was 1,057,870
for the year ended June 30, 2023, which were primarily attributable to the purchase of land and investment funds. 

Net cash used by financing activities 

Net cash used by financing activities amounted
to 44,683 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, which was repayment of bank loans and acquisition of subsidiaries. 

Net cash used by financing activities amounted
to 81,034 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, which was repayment of bank loans. 

Since we plan to build our land-based fish farming
demo sites in Taiwan, the U.S. and Brazil to promote our fish farming systems to the global market, we expect that we will require additional
capital, which includes construction costs, marketing costs, operation costs, etc., to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect
to obtain financing from shareholders or raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.
The shareholders are committed to provide additional financing required when we try to raise additional capital from third party
investors or banks. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising this additional capital. 

Business Combinations 

We account for business acquisitions in accordance
with ASC 805, Business Combinations . We measure the cost of an acquisition as the aggregate of the acquisition date fair values
of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition
are expensed as incurred. We record goodwill for the excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition, fair value of any non-controlling interests
and acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquired business over (ii) the fair value of the identifiable
net assets of the acquired business. 

The acquisition method of accounting requires
us to exercise judgment and make estimates and assumptions based on available information regarding the fair values of the elements of
a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset
valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies. We must also refine these estimates over a one-year measurement
period, to reflect any new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known,
would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional
amounts that we have recorded for the fair value of assets and liabilities in connection with an acquisition, these adjustments could
materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair
value of future acquired technology, user lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to
generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change
compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have
estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense.
If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed, which could materially
impact our results of operations.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company, 
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information in this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, under the supervision of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer performed an evaluation (the Evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide a reasonable
level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of June 30, 2024, due to the presence of material weaknesses described below, our disclosure controls and procedures
were ineffective. 

The following material weaknesses in our disclosure
controls and procedures at June 30, 2024 were: 

we did not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 

there were insufficient monitoring and review controls over the financial reporting closing process, including the lack of individuals with current knowledge of GAAP that led to the restatement of our previously issued financial statements; and 

inadequate segregation of duties. 

We believe that these material weaknesses primarily
relate, in part, to our lack of sufficient staff with appropriate training in GAAP and SEC rules and regulations with respect to financial
reporting functions, and the lack of robust accounting systems, as well as the lack of sufficient resources to hire such staff and implement
these accounting systems. 

We expect to remediate these material weaknesses
in the second half of 2024. However, we may discover additional material weaknesses that may require additional time and resources to
remediate. Our remediation process includes, but not limited to: 

Investing in information technology systems to enhance our operational and financial reporting and internal controls. 

Enhancing the organizational structure to support financial reporting processes and internal controls. 

Providing guidance, education and training to employees relating to our accounting policies and procedures. 

Further developing and documenting detailed policies and procedures regarding business processes for significant accounts, critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates. 

Establishing effective general controls over information technology systems to ensure that information produced can be relied upon by process level controls is relevant and reliable. 

42 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no
assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons within our Company and our consolidated
subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. There are inherent limitations
to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable,
not absolute, assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we took
several actions to correct past material weaknesses, including, but not limited to, establishing an audit committee of our Board comprised
of three independent directors, adding experienced accounting and financial personnel and retaining third-party consultants to review
our internal controls and recommend improvements. However, we may need to take additional measures to fully mitigate these issues, and
the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to (1) address the issues identified,
(2) ensure that our internal controls are effective or (3) ensure that the identified material weakness or other material weaknesses will
not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. 

43 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We were not subject to any legal proceedings during
the six months ended June 30, 2024 and there are currently no legal proceedings, to which we are a party, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

There have been no material changes in our risk
factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1,
2024. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

On April 14, 2024, Gui Zhou Grand Smooth Technology
Ltd. GZ GST ), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement dated as of April 14, 2024,
with Hangzhou SY Culture Media Co. Ltd. SY Culture ), pursuant to which GZ GST acquired all of the issued and outstanding
equity securities of SY Culture from the stockholders of SY Culture in exchange for the issuance of 600,000 unregistered shares of the
Company s common stock, par value 0.001 per share. 

The issuance of the capital stock listed above
was deemed exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, as amended (the Securities Act or Regulation
D promulgated thereunder in that the issuance of securities were made to an accredited investor and did not involve a public offering.
The recipient of such securities represented its intention to acquire the securities for investment purposes only and not with a view
to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 

Holding
Foreign Companies Accountable Act 

On December
2, 2021, the SEC adopted final amendments implementing the disclosure and submission requirements under the Holding Foreign Companies
Accountable Act (the HFCAA ), pursuant to which the SEC will identify a Commission-Identified Issuer if an
issuer has filed an annual report containing an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken
by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction, and will then impose a trading prohibition on an issuer after it is identified as and remains
a Commission-Identified Issuer for three consecutive years. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that
it is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong
Kong, because of positions taken by one or more authorities in such jurisdictions. Since the Company s auditor is located in Hong
Kong, the Company s auditor is included on a list of audit firms the PCAOB determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely
because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong, and is therefore subject to the PCAOB s determination. In May
2022, the Company was added to the SEC s conclusive lists of issuers identified under the HFCAA, or a Commission-Identified Issuer.
Therefore, the Company will be delisted and its securities will be prohibited from being traded over-the-counter if it remains
identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for three consecutive years. If the Company s securities are unable to be listed on
another securities exchange by then, such a delisting or prohibition of trading would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase
the Company s securities when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with a potential delisting or prohibition
of trading would have a negative impact on the price of the Company s securities. The Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act AHFCAA ), passed by the U.S. Senate and if enacted, would require Commission-Identified Issuers to comply with the PCAOB
audits within two consecutive years instead of three consecutive years. In light of the PRC government s recent expansion of authority
in Hong Kong, there are risks and uncertainties which the Company cannot foresee for the time being, and rules and regulations in China
can change quickly with little or no advance notice.
