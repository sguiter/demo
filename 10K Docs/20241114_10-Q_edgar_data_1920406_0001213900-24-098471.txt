Overview 

Asset
Entities is a technology company providing social media marketing and content delivery services across Discord, TikTok, and other social
media platforms. We also design, develop and manage servers for communities on Discord. Based on the growth of our Discord servers and
social media following, we have developed three categories of services: (1) our Discord investment education and entertainment services,
(2) social media and marketing services, and (3) our AE.360.DDM brand services. We also offer Ternary v2, a cloud-based
subscription management and payment processing solution for Discord communities, which includes a suite of customer relations management
tools and Stripe-verified payment processing. All of our services are based on our effective use of Discord as well as other social media
including TikTok, X, Instagram, and YouTube. 

Our
Discord investment education and entertainment service is designed primarily by and for enthusiastic Generation Z, or Gen Z, retail investors,
creators and influencers. Gen Z is commonly considered to be people born between 1997 and 2012. Our investment education and entertainment
service focuses on stock, real estate, cryptocurrency, and NFT community learning programs designed for the next generation. While we
believe that Gen Z will continue to be our primary market, our Discord server offering features education and entertainment content covering
real estate investments, which is expected to appeal strongly to older generations as well. Our current combined server user membership
was approximately 200,000 as of September 30, 2024. 

Our
social media and marketing services utilize our management s social influencer backgrounds by offering social media and marketing
campaign services to business clients. Our team of social influencer independent contractors, which we call our SiN or
 Social Influencer Network , can perform social media and marketing campaign services to expand our clients Discord
server bases and drive traffic to their businesses, as well as increase membership in our own servers. 

Our
 AE.360.DDM, Design Develop Manage service, or AE.360.DDM , is a suite of services to individuals and companies
seeking to create a server on Discord. We believe we are the first company to provide Design, Develop and Manage, or DDM,
services for any individual, company, or organization that wishes to join Discord and create their own community. With our AE.360.DDM
rollout, we are uniquely positioned to offer DDM services in the growing market for Discord servers. 

Through
Ternary v2, our subscription management and payment processing solution for Discord communities, subscribers can monetize and manage
their Discord users. Ternary v2 simplifies the process for our subscribers to: (i) sell memberships to their Discord servers on their
websites and collect payments through Stripe with daily payouts; (ii) add digital products and services and designate purchase options
to their Discord servers; (iii) customize their user Discord permissions and roles and other Discord settings; and (iv) utilize
our Discord bot to automatically apply their Discord user settings to authenticate new users, apply customizable permission sets to users,
and remove users when their subscriptions expire. As a Stripe-verified partner through Ternary v2, we can also assist subscribers with
integrating other platforms into their Discord servers with open application programming interfaces, further extending our platform s
capabilities. 

We
believe that we are a leading provider of all of these services, and that demand for all of our services will continue to grow. We expect
to experience rapid revenue growth from our services. We believe that we have built a scalable and sustainable business model and that
our competitive strengths position us favorably in each aspect of our business. 

Our
revenue depends on the number of paying subscribers to our Discord servers. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
we received revenue from 1,184 and 298 Asset Entities Discord server paying subscribers, respectively. 

Our
Historical Performance 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated
deficit of 9,994,891 and cash balance of 2,098,406. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a net loss of
 1,315,369 and 1,190,491, respectively. To date, the Company has financed its operations primarily through capital raises and sales of
its services. In April 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-278707), which was declared effective
by the SEC on April 26, 2024, for potential offerings of up to 100,000,000 in aggregate (the Shelf Registration Statement ),
subject to the requirement that in no event may we sell shares having a value exceeding more than one-third of our public float in any
12-month period under the Shelf Registration Statement so long as our public float remains below 75,000,000. In May 2024, the Company
completed the first of a two-part private placement of its Series A Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of 1.5 million, and in July 2024,
the Company completed the second part of the private placement for an additional 1.5 million in gross proceeds. In September 2024, the
Company entered into a Sales Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2024 (the ATM Sales Agreement ), between the Company and
A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (the Sales Agent ), and filed a prospectus supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement
for an at the market offering of shares of Class B Common Stock (the ATM Financing for gross proceeds of
up to 1,791,704. The Company expects that up to approximately 1.0 million of additional gross proceeds may be sold in the ATM Financing,
subject to the Company s ability to meet the requirements of SEC rules for the filing of an additional prospectus supplement to
the Shelf Registration Statement for such additional amount. Based on the Company s existing cash resources and the cash expected
to be received from the ATM Financing and other planned financings, it is expected that the Company will have sufficient funds to carry
out the Company s planned operations through September 30, 2025 and for at least 12 months beyond that period. For further discussion,
see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and
Capital Resources .

Principal
Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance 

Our
operating results are primarily affected by the following factors: 

our
 ability to acquire new customers and users or retain existing customers and users; 

our
 ability to offer competitive pricing; 

our
 ability to broaden product or service offerings; 

industry
 demand and competition; 

our
 ability to leverage technology and use and develop efficient processes; 

our
 ability to attract and retain talented employees and contractors; and 

market
 conditions and our market position. 

Emerging
Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company 

We
qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ).
As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging
growth company, we will not be required to: 

have
 an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 

present
 three years, instead of two years, of audited financial statements, with correspondingly reduced Management s Discussion
 and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations disclosure in this Annual Report; 

comply
 with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation
 or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e.,
 an auditor discussion and analysis); 

comply
 with certain greenhouse gas emissions disclosure and related third-party assurance requirements; 

submit
 certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; 
 and 

disclose
 certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons
 of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period
provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), for complying with new or
revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until
those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition
period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting
standards. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our
initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues are 1,235,000,000 or more,
(ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act ), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates
exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iv) the date on which we have
issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. 

To
the extent that we continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the
Exchange Act, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth
company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including as to: (i) the auditor attestation requirements
of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (ii) scaled executive compensation disclosures; (iii) presenting two years of audited financial
statements, instead of three years; and (iv) compliance with certain greenhouse gas emissions disclosure and related third-party assurance
requirements.

Recent
Developments 

On

Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan due to the termination of the grantee s employment, which were forfeited
and returned to the Plan in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

Revenues .
Our revenues increased 237.4 to approximately 0.20 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 0.06 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues from the increased number
of our Discord server paying subscribers during the three months ended September 30, 2024, including subscribers to the OptionsSwing
and Pure Profits Discord servers that the Company acquired in November 2023 and June 2024, respectively, compared to such revenues for

expenses increased 21.4 to approximately 1.52 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 1.25 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising, marketing, payroll and
other administrative expenses and administrative cost of public filings of approximately 0.24 million and an increase in management
compensation costs of approximately 0.03 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to such costs for the three

from operations increased 10.5 to approximately 1.32 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 1.19
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising, marketing, payroll
and other administrative expenses and administrative cost of public filings of approximately 0.24 million and an increase in management
compensation costs of approximately 0.03 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to such costs for the three

Revenues .
Our revenues increased 114.5 to approximately 0.42 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 0.20 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues from the increased number of
our Discord server paying subscribers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, including subscribers to the OptionsSwing and
Pure Profits Discord servers that the Company acquired in November 2023 and June 2024, respectively, compared to such revenues for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, which preceded the acquisitions of the OptionsSwing and Pure Profits Discord servers. There was
no material difference in the Company s subscription pricing structure between these periods. 

Operating Expenses .
Our total operating expenses increased 28.3 to approximately 4.85 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately
 3.78 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising, marketing,
payroll and other administrative expenses and administrative cost of public filings of approximately 0.84 million and an increase in
management compensation costs of approximately 0.23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to such costs for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Loss From Operations . Our loss
from operations increased 23.6 to approximately 4.43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 3.58
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising, marketing, payroll
and other administrative expenses and administrative cost of public filings of approximately 0.84 million and an increase in management
compensation costs of approximately 0.23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to such costs for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had an accumulated deficit of 9,994,891. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a net loss of 4,428,810
and 3,582,799, respectively. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through capital raises and sales of our services. In
April 2024, we filed the Shelf Registration Statement, which was also declared effective by the SEC in April 2024, for potential offerings
of up to 100,000,000 in aggregate, subject to the requirement that in no event may we sell shares having a value exceeding more than
one-third of our public float in any 12-month period under the Shelf Registration Statement so long as our public float remains below
 75,000,000. In May 2024, the Company completed the first of a two-part private placement of its Series A Preferred Stock for gross proceeds
of 1.5 million, and in July 2024, the Company completed the second part of the private placement for an additional 1.5 million in gross
proceeds. In September 2024, the Company entered into the ATM Sales Agreement and filed a prospectus supplement to the Shelf Registration
Statement for the ATM Financing for gross proceeds of up to 1,791,704. The Company expects that up to approximately 1.0 million of additional
gross proceeds may be sold in the ATM Financing, subject to the Company s ability to meet the requirements of SEC rules for the
filing of an additional prospectus supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement for such additional amount. Based on our existing cash
resources and the cash expected to be received from the ATM Financing and other planned financings, it is expected that the Company will
have sufficient funds to carry out the Company s planned operations through September 30, 2025 and for at least 12 months beyond
that period, including the Company s costs associated with being a public reporting company. 

23 

We
may, however, in the future require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions, implementation of our strategy to
expand our business, or other investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our own financial resources are insufficient to
satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The
sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased
debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing
may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable
to us, or at all, could limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.

Net cash used in operating activities was approximately
 3.45 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately 2.95
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net loss. 

Net cash used in investing activities was approximately
 0.215 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.008 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
This change was primarily due to the purchase of an intangible asset and increased purchases of
property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a lesser amount of such
purchases for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was
approximately 2.84 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 6.85 million net cash provided
by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily due to the reduced amount of proceeds
from the Company s private placements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the proceeds received from its
February 2023 initial public offering. 

Initial
Public Offering and Underwriting Agreement 

On
February 2, 2023, the Company entered into the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of February 2, 2023, between the Company and Boustead
Securities, LLC, a registered broker-dealer Boustead ), as representative of the underwriters named on Schedule 1 thereto
(the Underwriting Agreement ), relating to the Company s initial public offering of 1,500,000 shares of Class B Common
Stock (the IPO Shares ). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, in exchange for Boustead s firm commitment to purchase
the IPO Shares, the Company agreed to sell the IPO Shares to Boustead at a purchase price (the IPO Price of 23.25 (93 
of the public offering price per share of 25.00, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and before deducting a 0.75 
non-accountable expense allowance), and one or more warrants to purchase 7 of the aggregate number of shares of Class B Common Stock
sold in the initial public offering, at an exercise price equal to 125 of the public offering price, subject to adjustment (the Representative s
Warrant ). 

On
February 3, 2023, the IPO Shares and 300,000 outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock that were registered for resale as described
below were listed and commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market tier of Nasdaq. 

24 

The
closing of the initial public offering took place on February 7, 2023. At the closing, the Company sold the IPO Shares for total gross
proceeds of 7,500,000. After deducting the underwriting discounts, commissions, non-accountable expense allowance, and other expenses
from the initial public offering, the Company received net proceeds of approximately 6.6 million. The Company also issued Boustead the
Representative s Warrant exercisable for the purchase of 21,000 shares of Class B Common Stock at an exercise price of 31.25 per
share, subject to adjustment. The Representative s Warrant may be exercised by payment of cash or by a cashless exercise provision,
and may be exercised at any time for five years following the date of issuance. 

The
IPO Shares were offered and sold, and the Representative s Warrant was issued, pursuant to the Company s Registration Statement
on Form S-1 (File No. 333-267258), as amended, initially filed with the SEC on September 2, 2022, and declared effective by the SEC on
February 2, 2023 (the IPO Registration Statement ), and the final prospectus, dated February 2, 2023 (the Final IPO
Prospectus ), filed with the SEC on February 6, 2023 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) of the Securities Act. In addition, a total of
300,000 shares of Class B Common Stock were registered for resale by the selling stockholders named in the IPO Registration Statement,
and a final prospectus relating to these shares, dated February 2, 2023 (the Final Resale Prospectus ), was filed with the
SEC on February 6, 2023 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) of the Securities Act. Any resales of these shares occurred at a fixed price of 25.00
per share until the Class B Common Stock was listed on Nasdaq. Thereafter, these sales will occur at fixed prices, at market prices prevailing
at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices, or at negotiated prices. The Company will not receive any proceeds
from the resale of Class B Common Stock by the selling stockholders. 

The
IPO Registration Statement also registered for sale shares of Class B Common Stock with a maximum aggregate offering price of 1,125,000
for an additional 45,000 shares of Class B Common Stock at the assumed public offering price of 25.00 per share upon full exercise of
the underwriters over-allotment option; and up to an additional 3,150 shares of Class B Common Stock underlying the Representative s
Warrant with a maximum aggregate offering price of 98,437.50 at the assumed exercise price of 31.25 per share assuming full exercise
of the over-allotment option. The underwriters over-allotment option expired unexercised. The Company has not received any proceeds
from the exercise of the Representative s Warrant because it has not been exercised. 

On
April 4, 2023, Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to the IPO Registration Statement (the Post-Effective Amendment was filed
with the SEC and became effective on April 14, 2023. The Post-Effective Amendment was required to be filed to update the IPO Registration
Statement to include, among other things, the information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023. The Post-Effective Amendment maintained the effectiveness of the IPO
Registration Statement with respect to the sale of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Representative s
Warrant and the resale of the shares of common stock held by the selling stockholders. Updated prospectuses were included with the Post-Effective
Amendment. The Post-Effective Amendment also incorporates by reference all documents subsequently filed by the Company pursuant to Sections
13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, prior to the termination of the offering described in the prospectuses included with the
Post-Effective Amendment. 

As
stated in the IPO Registration Statement and the Final IPO Prospectus, the Company intended to use the net proceeds from the initial
public offering for investment in corporate infrastructure, marketing and promotion of Discord communities, social campaigns, and the
Company s AE.360.DDM service, expansion of the Company s SiN service, increasing staff and company
personnel, and general working capital, operating, and other corporate expenses. As stated in the Post-Effective Amendment, the Company
intended to use any proceeds from the exercise of the Representative s Warrant for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

The
following is the Company s reasonable estimate of the uses of the proceeds from the initial public offering from the date of the
closing of the offering on February 7, 2023 through September 30, 2024: 

None
 was used for construction of plant, building and facilities; 

None
 was used for the purchase and installation of machinery and equipment; 

None
 was used for purchases of real estate; 

25 

0.3 million was used for the acquisition of other businesses; 

None
 was used for the repayment of indebtedness; 

Approximately
 6.0 million was used for working capital; and 

None was used for temporary investments. 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, none of the proceeds from the initial public offering were used to make direct or
indirect payments to any of the Company s directors or officers, any of their associates, any persons owning 10 or more of any
class of the Company s equity securities, or any of our affiliates, or direct or indirect payments to any others other than for
the direct costs of the offering. 

There
has not been, and the Company does not expect, any material change in the planned use of proceeds from the initial public offering as
described in the IPO Registration Statement and the Final IPO Prospectus or any exercise of the Representative s Warrant, as described
in the Post-Effective Amendment. 

Pursuant
to the Underwriting Agreement, as of February 3, 2023, we were subject to a lock-up agreement that provided that we may not, without
the prior written consent of Boustead, for 12 months, subject to certain exceptions, (i) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell
any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, change the terms of, or grant any option, right or warrant
to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of capital stock of the Company or any securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of the Company; (ii) file or cause to be filed any registration
statement with the SEC relating to the offering of any shares of capital stock of the Company or any securities convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of the Company (other than pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-8 for employee
benefit plans); or (iii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic
consequences of ownership of capital stock of the Company, whether any such transaction described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above
is to be settled by delivery of shares of capital stock of the Company or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. 

The
Underwriting Agreement contains other customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company, customary conditions to closing,
indemnification obligations of the Company and Boustead, including for liabilities under the Securities Act, other obligations of the
parties, and termination provisions. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Underwriting Agreement were made

Stock during the five business days prior to the closing of the purchase of the Triton Shares (the Triton Closing ). The
Triton Closing was required to occur within five business days after the Triton Shares were received by Triton. Triton s obligation
to purchase the Triton Shares was conditioned on the effectiveness of a registration statement covering the resale of the Triton Shares
and Triton s ownership not exceeding 9.99 of the Class B Common Stock outstanding as of June 30, 2023. 

The
Triton Closing Agreement contained additional requirements, including that the Company maintain the listing of the Class B Common Stock

relating to misrepresentations, breaches of obligations, and third-party claims relating to the Triton Closing Agreement, with certain
exceptions. The Triton Closing Agreement provided that it would expire either upon the Triton Closing or September 30, 2023. 

Under
an Amended and Restated Closing Agreement, dated as of August 1, 2023, between the Company and Triton (the Triton Amended and
Restated Closing Agreement ), the Closing Agreement was amended and restated to provide that, subject to its terms and conditions,
the Company may deliver a Triton Closing Notice and issue certain securities to Triton at any time on or before September 30, 2023, pursuant

pre-funded warrants Triton Pre-Funded Warrants and together with Triton Shares, Triton Securities that

Triton Shares and Triton Pre-Funded Warrants, such that the aggregate price of the Triton Shares and the Triton Pre-Funded Warrants together

price of 1,000,000. Any proceeds under the Triton Amended and Restated Closing Agreement must be reduced by a 25,000 administrative
fee. The Triton Amended and Restated Closing Agreement also provided that it would expire either upon the date that Triton paid the required
purchase price after receiving a Triton Closing Notice, or September 30, 2023. The terms of the price of the Triton Securities and the
required date of the Triton Closing were not amended, except that if Triton elected to purchase Triton Pre-Funded Warrants in lieu of
Triton Shares, then the purchase price per Triton Pre-Funded Warrant acquired would be reduced by 0.01 with such 0.01 being the exercise
price of the Triton Pre-Funded Warrant. 

The
Triton Amended and Restated Closing Agreement provided that Triton s obligation to purchase the Triton Securities was subject to
certain conditions. These conditions included the filing and effectiveness of the required registration statement for the resale of the
Triton Securities. In addition, the Class B Common Stock was required to remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market tier of Nasdaq, and
the issuance of the Triton Securities was required to not violate any requirements of Nasdaq. Triton s purchase requirement was
also subject to provisions that prevented Triton from acquiring shares of Class B Common Stock at the time of any sale of the Triton
Securities or exercise of the Triton Pre-Funded Warrants that would result in the number of shares beneficially owned by Triton and its
affiliates exceeding 9.99 of the total number of shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance
of the shares under the Triton Amended and Restated Closing Agreement or the Triton Pre-Funded Warrants (the Triton Beneficial
Ownership Limitation ). The Triton Amended and Restated Closing Agreement provided for the issuance of the Triton Pre-Funded Warrants
in lieu of issuance of some or all the Triton Shares, with an exercise price of 0.01 per share and with no expiration date, if, in Triton s
sole discretion, it would otherwise exceed the Triton Beneficial Ownership Limitation, or otherwise upon Triton s election. For
each of the Triton Shares that Triton instead elected to be issuable as Triton Warrant Shares, the number of Triton Shares that we were
required to issue to Triton at the time of any sale of the Triton Securities was required to be decreased on a one-for-one basis.
We were also required to provide indemnification against liabilities relating to misrepresentations, breaches of obligations, and third-party
claims relating to the Triton Amended and Restated Closing Agreement, with certain exceptions.

on October 13, 2023.

the Amended A R Closing Agreement.

a Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Closing Agreement (the Third Triton Amendment ), dated as of March 29, 2024, the
Company and Triton agreed to amend the Amended A R Closing Agreement to provide that the Amended A R Closing Agreement would
expire on April 30, 2024, instead of March 31, 2024. The Third Triton Amendment did not amend any of the other provisions of the Amended

Registration
Rights Agreement 

In
connection with the Ionic Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to provide certain registration rights to Ionic, pursuant to the Registration
Rights Agreement, dated as of May 24, 2024, between the Company and Ionic (the Ionic Registration Rights Agreement ). The
Ionic Registration Rights Agreement provides for the registration for resale of any and all shares of Class B Common Stock issuable to
Ionic with respect to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock under the Ionic Purchase Agreement (the Registrable Conversion Shares ).
Within the later of 15 calendar days of the First Ionic Closing or May 24, 2024, the Company was required to file a registration statement
(the First Registration Statement for the offer and resale of the maximum number of Registrable Conversion Shares permitted
to be covered in accordance with applicable SEC rules, regulations and interpretations. The First Registration Statement was required
to be declared effective within 45 days of the First Ionic Closing, or 90 days if the First Registration Statement received a review.
Pursuant to these requirements, a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-280020), was originally filed by the Company with
the SEC on June 7, 2024, and as amended, was filed to register the offer and resale of 385,894 shares of Class B Common Stock, which
was considered the maximum number of Registrable Conversion Shares permitted to be covered in accordance with applicable SEC rules, regulations
and interpretations, and was declared effective by the SEC on July 24, 2024. Following the Second Ionic Closing, which occurred on July
29, 2024, for the issuance and sale of an additional 165 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of 1,500,000, the Company
was required to file a registration statement (the Second Registration Statement within 45 days of the Second Ionic Closing

SEC rules, regulations and interpretations. The Second Registration Statement was required to be declared effective within 45 days of
the Second Ionic Closing, or 90 days if the Second Registration Statement received a review. Pursuant to these requirements, a Registration
Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-281438), was originally filed by the Company with the SEC on August 9, 2024, and as amended, was
filed to register the offer and resale of 482,120 shares of Class B Common Stock, which was considered the maximum number of Registrable
Conversion Shares permitted to be covered in accordance with applicable SEC rules, regulations and interpretations, and was declared
effective by the SEC on September 11, 2024. 

In
the event the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available under the First Registration Statement and the Second Registration Statement
is insufficient to cover all of the Registrable Conversion Shares, the Company will be required to file at least one additional registration
statement (each of such additional registration statement, the First Registration Statement, and the Second Registration Statement, and
collectively, the Registration Statement within 14 days of the date that the necessity arises and that such additional
Registration Statement may be filed under SEC rules to cover such Registrable Conversion Shares up to the maximum permitted to be covered
under SEC rules, which must be made effective within 45 days of such date, or 90 days if such additional Registration Statement receives
a review. Any failure to meet the filing deadline for either the First Registration Statement or the Second Registration Statement Filing
Failure would have resulted in liquidated damages of 20,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. Any failure to meet the effectiveness
deadline for any Registration Statement Effectiveness Failure will result in liquidated damages of 20,000 shares of Class
B Common Stock. Each of the shares issuable upon a Filing Failure or an Effectiveness Failure must also be covered by a Registration
Statement to the same extent as the Registrable Conversion Shares. The Company will be required to use its best efforts to keep each
Registration Statement effective until all such shares of Class B Common Stock are sold or may be sold without restriction pursuant to
Rule 144 under the Securities Act Rule 144 ), and without the requirement for us to be in compliance with the current public

Terms
of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock under Certificate of Designation and Securities Purchase Agreement 

Pursuant
to the Ionic Purchase Agreement, on May 24, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
of the Company with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada (the Initial Certificate of Designation ), as amended
by the Certificate of Amendment to Designation (the First Designation Amendment filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Nevada on June 14, 2024, as amended by the Certificate of Amendment to Designation (the Second Designation Amendment filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on September 4, 2024 at 9:58 AM Pacific Daylight Time, as amended by the Certificate
of Amendment to Designation (the Third Designation Amendment filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada
on September 4, 2024 at 11:38 AM Pacific Daylight Time (as amended, the Certificate of Designation ), designating 660 shares
of the Company s preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 0.0001 par value per share, and setting
forth the voting and other powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights of the Series A Preferred Stock.
Each share of Series A Preferred Stock has an initial stated value Stated Value of 10,000 per share. 

The
Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to all other capital stock of the Company with respect to the payment of dividends, distributions
and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company, unless the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred Stock consent to the creation of other capital stock of the Company that is senior or equal in rank to the Series
A Preferred Stock. 

Holders
of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive cumulative dividends, in shares of Class B Common Stock (or cash at the Company s
option) on the Stated Value at an annual rate of 6 (which will increase to 12 if a Triggering Event (as defined in the Certificate
of Designation) occurs until such Triggering Event, if curable, is cured). Dividends will be payable upon conversion or redemption of
the Series A Preferred Stock. 

Holders
of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock into a number of shares of Class B Common
Stock determined by dividing the Stated Value of such shares (plus any accrued but unpaid dividends and other amounts due, unless paid
by the Company in cash) by the conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock (the Conversion Price ). The initial Conversion
Price is 3.75, subject to adjustment including adjustments due to full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions. Holders may elect to convert
shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Class B Common Stock at an alternate Conversion Price equal to 85 (or 70 if the Company s
Class B Common Stock is suspended from trading on or delisted from a principal trading market or upon occurrence of a Triggering Event)
of the average of the lowest daily volume weighed average price of the Class B Common Stock during the Alternate Conversion Measuring
Period (as defined in the Certificate of Designation). 

A
holder of Series A Preferred Stock may not convert the Series A Preferred Stock into Class B Common Stock to the extent that such conversion
would cause such holder s beneficial ownership of Class B Common Stock to exceed 4.99 of the outstanding Class B Common Stock
immediately after conversion, which may be increased by the holder to up to 9.99 upon no fewer than 61 days prior notice (the
 Series A Beneficial Ownership Limitation ). Any conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that would result in the
holder beneficially owning in excess of 4.99 of the shares of Class B Common Stock will not be effected, and the shares of Class B Common
Stock that would cause such excess will be held in abeyance and not issued to the holder until the date the Company is notified by the
holder that its ownership is less than 4.99 , at the applicable Conversion Price, and subject to the holder s compliance with other
applicable procedural requirements for conversion. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are not prohibited from delivering a Conversion
Notice (as defined by the Certificate of Designation) while another Conversion Notice remains outstanding. 

The
Certificate of Designation provides that the Conversion Price may not be lower than a floor price (the Floor Price of
 0.4275 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits and similar transactions. If the Conversion Price would be less than the Floor
Price, then, subject to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation, the Stated Value will automatically increase in the
manner provided pursuant to the Certificate of Designation, as described in the following paragraph. The Series A Preferred Stock also
may not be converted except to the extent that the shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon such conversion may be resold pursuant
to Rule 144 or an effective and available registration statement. 

32 

If
a conversion of Series A Preferred Stock would have resulted in the issuance of an amount of shares of Class B Common Stock exceeding
19.99 of the Company s common stock outstanding as of the date of the signing of the related binding agreement, which number of
shares would be reduced, on a share-for-share basis, by the number of shares of common stock issued or issuable pursuant to any transaction
or series of transactions that may be aggregated with the transactions contemplated by the Certificate of Designation under applicable
rules of Nasdaq, including Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) (such amount, the Exchange Limitation ), the Conversion Price would
have been required to be at least equal to the price (the Minimum Price that would be the lower of the last closing price
of the stock immediately preceding the signing of the related binding agreement and the average closing price for the five Trading Days
(as defined below) immediately preceding the signing of the related binding agreement, before the effectiveness of the approval of such
number of the holders of the outstanding shares of the Company s voting securities as required by the Bylaws of the Company (the
 Bylaws and the Nevada Revised Statutes NRS ), to ratify and approve all of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents (as defined in the Ionic Purchase Agreement), including the issuance of all of the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock and shares of Class B Common Stock upon conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, all as may be required by the applicable
rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Capital Market tier of Nasdaq (or any successor entity) (the Stockholder Approval ).
In the event that the Conversion Price on a Conversion Date (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) would have been less than
the applicable Minimum Price or the Floor Price if not for the immediately preceding sentence, then, upon any conversion of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, the Stated Value will automatically be increased by an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the higher of (I) the highest price that the Class B Common Stock trades at on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion
Date and (II) the applicable Conversion Price and (B) the difference obtained by subtracting (I) the number of shares of Class B Common
Stock delivered (or to be delivered) to the holder on the applicable Conversion Date with respect to such conversion of shares of Series
A Preferred Stock from (II) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Stated Value (plus any accrued but unpaid dividends and other amounts
due on such shares) of the Series A Preferred Stock being converted that the holder has elected to be the subject of the applicable conversion,
by (y) the applicable Conversion Price. 

The
Ionic Purchase Agreement required that the Company obtain the Stockholder Approval, by the prior written consent of the requisite stockholders
as required by the Bylaws and the NRS, to ratify and approve all of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, including
the issuance of all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares
pursuant to the Ionic Purchase Agreement, all as may be required by the applicable rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Capital Market
tier of Nasdaq (or any successor entity). The Ionic Purchase Agreement and the Certificate of Designation further required that the Company
file a Preliminary Information Statement on Schedule 14C with the SEC within 10 days of the date of the First Ionic Closing followed
by the filing of a Definitive Information Statement on Schedule 14C with the SEC within 20 days of the date of the First Ionic Closing,
or within 45 days of the date of the First Ionic Closing if delayed due to a court or regulatory agency, including but not limited to
the SEC, which was required to disclose the Stockholder Approval. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, the Stockholder Approval was
required to become effective 20 days after the Definitive Information Statement was sent or given in accordance with SEC rules. 

In
accordance with the requirements and provisions described above, on May 24, 2024, the Company obtained the execution of a written consent
in lieu of a special meeting of a majority of the voting power of the stockholders of the Company approving a resolution approving the
issuance of Class B Common Stock in aggregate in excess of the limitations provided by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), including that an
amount of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to or greater than 20 of the total common stock or voting power outstanding on the date
of the Certificate of Designation may be issued pursuant to the Certificate of Designation at a price that may be less than the Minimum
Price. On May 31, 2024, the Company filed a Preliminary Information Statement on Schedule 14C with the SEC. On June 13, 2024, the Company
filed a Definitive Information Statement on Schedule 14C with the SEC disclosing the Stockholder Approval. As of the 20 th day
following actions meeting these and other applicable requirements, the Company is permitted to issue more than the limited number of
shares as defined by the Exchange Limitation, at a Conversion Price that may be below the Minimum Price. 

Under
the Ionic Purchase Agreement, if the closing price of the Class B Common Stock falls below 3.75 per share, the holder s total
sales of Class B Common Stock will be restricted. The holder may only sell either the greater of 25,000 per Trading Day or 15 of the
daily trading volume of the Class B Common Stock reported by Bloomberg, LP, until the closing price exceeds 3.75. Trading Day 
is defined as a day on which the principal trading market for the Class B Common Stock is open for trading for at least six hours. 

33 

In
addition, while any of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, if the closing price of the Class B Common Stock is equal
to or less than 0.4275 per share for a period of ten consecutive Trading Days, then the Company will promptly take all corporate action
necessary to authorize a reverse stock split of the Class B Common Stock by a ratio equal to or greater than 300 of the quotient obtained
by dividing 0.4275 by the lowest closing price of the Class B Common Stock during such ten-Trading Day period, including calling a special
meeting of stockholders to authorize such reverse stock split or obtaining written consent for such reverse stock split, and voting the
management shares of the Company in favor of such reverse stock split. 

The
Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert to Class B Common Stock upon the 24-month anniversary of the initial issuance date
of the Series A Preferred Stock. 

The
Company will have the right at any time to redeem all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding at a price equal
to 110 of the Stated Value plus any accrued but unpaid dividends and other amounts due. 

Holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock will generally have the right to vote on an as-converted basis with the Class B Common Stock, subject
to the Series A Beneficial Ownership Limitation. 

Under
the Ionic Purchase Agreement, the Company generally may not sell securities in a financing transaction while Ionic beneficially owns
any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or common stock until the end of the 30-day period following the initial date of the effectiveness
of each Registration Statement or during any Alternate Conversion Measuring Period. In addition, the Company may not file any other registration
statement or any offering statement under the Securities Act, other than a registration statement on Form S-8 or supplements or amendments
to registration statements that were filed and effective as of the date of the Ionic Purchase Agreement (solely to the extent necessary
to keep such registration statements effective and available and not with respect to any Subsequent Placement), unless each of the First
Registration Statement and the Second Registration Statement is effective and the respective prospectuses are available for use, or the
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and underlying shares of Class B Common Stock may be resold without limitation under Rule
144. Additionally, the Company may not, directly or indirectly, redeem, or declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on, any securities
of the Company without the prior express written consent of Ionic (other than as required by the Certificate of Designation).

Initial Certificate of Designation, the First Designation Amendment, Second Designation Amendment and the Third Designation Amendment

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

This discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based
on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are
described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that the
following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more
significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates
relate to the following: 

37 

Intangible
Assets 

Intangible assets acquired are recorded at fair
value. We test our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of the assets may not be recoverable. We test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually
or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If
the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying
value. Management uses considerable judgment to determine key assumptions, including projected revenue, royalty rates and appropriate
discount rates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no intangible asset impairment charges. 

Finite-lived
intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which ranges from 5 to 15 years. Our
finite-lived intangible assets include acquired franchise agreements, acquired customer relationships, acquired customer lists, and internally
developed software. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets include acquired domain names, trade names, and purchased software. 

Intangible
assets internally developed are measured at cost. We capitalize costs to develop or purchase computer software for internal use which
are incurred during the application development stage. These costs include fees paid to third parties for development services and payroll
costs for employees time spent developing the software. We expense costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and the
post-implementation stage. Capitalized development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the
software. The capitalization and ongoing assessment of recoverability of development costs requires considerable judgment by management
with respect to certain external factors, including, but not limited to, technological and economic feasibility, and estimated economic
life. 

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets Other Than Goodwill 

Long-lived
assets with finite lives, primarily property and equipment, intangible assets, and operating lease right-of-use assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated
cash flows from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are below the asset s carrying value, then the asset is deemed
to be impaired and written down to its fair value. 

Advertising
Expenses 

The Company expenses advertising costs as they
incurred. Total advertising expenses were 453,976 and 324,570 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively, and have been included as part of general and administrative expenses. 

Research
and Development 

Research
and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Third-party research and development costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been
achieved as defined under the applicable agreement. 

The Company incurred research and development
expenses of 336,719 and 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and have been included as part
of contract labor. 

38 

Stock
based compensation 

Service-Based
Awards 

The
Company records stock-based compensation for awards granted to employees, non-employees, and to members of the Board for their services
on the Board based on the grant date fair value of awards issued, and the expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period, which is generally one to three years. 

For
restricted stock awards RSAs issued under the Company s stock-based compensation plans, the fair value of each
grant is calculated based on the Company s stock price on the date of grant. 

Share
Repurchase 

Share
repurchases are open market purchases. Share repurchases are generally recorded on the settlement date, as treasury stock. When shares
are cancelled, the value of repurchased shares is deducted from stockholders equity through common stock with the excess over
par value recorded to accumulated deficit. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue utilizing the following steps: (i) Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer; (ii) Identify the
performance obligations in the contract; (iii) Determine the transaction price; (iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract; (v) Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. 

Subscriptions 

Subscription
revenue is related to a single performance obligation that is recognized over time when earned. Subscriptions are paid in advance and
can be purchased on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. Any quarterly or annual subscription revenue is recognized as a contract liability
recorded over the contracted service period. 

Marketing 

Revenue
related to marketing campaign contracts with customers are normally of a short duration, typically less than two (2) weeks. 

AE.360.DDM
Contracts 

Revenue
related to AE.360.DDM contracts with customers are normally of a short duration, typically less than one (1) week. 

Contract
Liabilities 

these agreements is recognized over the related
service period. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total contract liabilities were 610 and 3,445 respectively.
Contract liabilities are expected to be recognized as revenue over a period not to exceed twelve (12) months. 

Changes in contract liabilities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 are as follows:

Earnings
per Share of Common Stock 

The Company has adopted ASC Topic 260, Earnings
per Share which requires presentation of basic earnings per share on the face of the statements of operations for all
entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic earnings per share
computation. In the accompanying interim financial statements, basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the
potential dilution that could occur from common stock issuable through contingent share arrangements, stock options and warrants unless
the result would be antidilutive. The Company would account for the potential dilution from convertible securities using the as-if
converted method. The Company accounts for warrants and options using the treasury stock method. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
warrants representing 105,490 shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation from diluted net loss per
share as the result was anti-dilutive. 

Related
Parties 

The Company follows ASC 850, Related
Party Disclosures , for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions and balances.
There were no related party transactions except management fees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company
paid management fees to their controlling members totaling 2,513,562 and 2,275,878, respectively. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will
have a material impact on its interim financial statements.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) prior to the filing of this Quarterly Report

period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective
at a reasonable assurance level. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

Use
of Proceeds from Registered Securities 

On
February 2, 2023, the Company entered into the Underwriting Agreement with Boustead, as representative of the underwriters named on Schedule
1 thereto, relating to the Company s initial public offering of the IPO Shares. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, in exchange
for Boustead s firm commitment to purchase the IPO Shares, the Company agreed to sell the IPO Shares to Boustead at the IPO Price
as reduced by a 0.75 non-accountable expense allowance, and the Representative s Warrant. 

On
February 3, 2023, the IPO Shares and 300,000 outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock that were registered for resale as described
below were listed and commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market tier of Nasdaq. 

The
closing of the initial public offering took place on February 7, 2023. At the closing, the Company sold the IPO Shares for total gross
proceeds of 7,500,000. After deducting the underwriting discounts, commissions, non-accountable expense allowance, and other expenses
from the initial public offering, the Company received net proceeds of approximately 6.6 million. The Company also issued Boustead the
Representative s Warrant exercisable for the purchase of 21,000 shares of Class B Common Stock at an exercise price of 31.25 per
share, subject to adjustment. The Representative s Warrant may be exercised by payment of cash or by a cashless exercise provision,
and may be exercised at any time for five years following the date of issuance. 

The
IPO Shares were offered and sold, and the Representative s Warrant was issued, pursuant to the IPO Registration Statement, initially
filed with the SEC on September 2, 2022, and declared effective by the SEC on February 2, 2023, and the Final IPO Prospectus filed with
the SEC on February 6, 2023 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) of the Securities Act. In addition, a total of 300,000 shares of Class B Common
Stock were registered for resale by the selling stockholders named in the IPO Registration Statement and the related Final Resale Prospectus.
Any resales of these shares occurred at a fixed price of 25.00 per share until the Class B Common Stock was listed on Nasdaq. Thereafter,
these sales will occur at fixed prices, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices,
or at negotiated prices. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the resale of Class B Common Stock by the selling stockholders. 

The
IPO Registration Statement also registered for sale shares of Class B Common Stock with a maximum aggregate offering price of 1,125,000
for an additional 45,000 shares of Class B Common Stock at the assumed public offering price of 25.00 per share upon full exercise of
the underwriters over-allotment option; and up to an additional 3,150 shares of Class B Common Stock underlying the Representative s
Warrant with a maximum aggregate offering price of 98,437.50 at the assumed exercise price of 31.25 per share assuming full exercise
of the over-allotment option. The underwriters over-allotment option expired unexercised. The Company has not received any proceeds
from the exercise of the Representative s Warrant because it has not been exercised. 

On
April 4, 2023, the Post-Effective Amendment was filed with the SEC and became effective on April 14, 2023. The Post-Effective Amendment
was required to be filed to update the IPO Registration Statement to include, among other things, the information contained in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023. The Post-Effective Amendment
maintained the effectiveness of the IPO Registration Statement with respect to the sale of shares of common stock issuable upon
exercise of the Representative s Warrant and the resale of the shares of common stock held by the selling stockholders. Updated
prospectuses were included with the Post-Effective Amendment. The Post-Effective Amendment also incorporates by reference all documents
subsequently filed by the Company pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, prior to the termination of the
offering described in the prospectuses included with the Post-Effective Amendment. 

41 

As
stated in the IPO Registration Statement and the Final IPO Prospectus, the Company intended to use the net proceeds from the initial
public offering for investment in corporate infrastructure, marketing and promotion of Discord communities, social campaigns, and the
Company s AE.360.DDM service, expansion of the Company s SiN service, increasing staff and company
personnel, and general working capital, operating, and other corporate expenses. As stated in the Post-Effective Amendment, the Company
intended to use any proceeds from the exercise of the Representative s Warrant for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

The
following is the Company s reasonable estimate of the uses of the proceeds from the initial public offering from the date of the
closing of the offering on February 7, 2023 through September 30, 2024: 

None
 was used for construction of plant, building and facilities; 

None
 was used for the purchase and installation of machinery and equipment; 

None
 was used for purchases of real estate; 

0.3 million was used for the acquisition of other businesses; 

None
 was used for the repayment of indebtedness; 

Approximately
 6.0 million was used for working capital; and 

None was used for temporary investments. 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, none of the proceeds from the initial public offering were used to make direct
or indirect payments to any of the Company s directors or officers, any of their associates, any persons owning 10 or more of
any class of the Company s equity securities, or any of our affiliates, or direct or indirect payments to any others other than
for the direct costs of the offering. 

There
has not been, and the Company does not expect, any material change in the planned use of proceeds from the initial public offering as
described in the IPO Registration Statement and the Final IPO Prospectus or any exercise of the Representative s Warrant, as described
in the Post-Effective Amendment. 

Unregistered

that were not previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K.

of such procedures. 

Pursuant
to the First July 2024 Boustead Warrant Assignment Agreement, all of the rights to the July 2024 Boustead Warrant were assigned by Boustead
to Sutter. Pursuant to the Second July 2024 Boustead Warrant Assignment Agreement, all of the rights to the July 2024 Boustead Warrant
were assigned by Sutter to the Warrant Assignee, a registered representative of Sutter. Pursuant to the First July 2024 Boustead Warrant
Assignment Agreement and the Second July 2024 Boustead Warrant Assignment Agreement, the July 2024 Boustead Warrant was cancelled, and
the July 2024 Assignee Warrant was issued to the Warrant Assignee. The terms of the July 2024 Assignee Warrant are identical to those
