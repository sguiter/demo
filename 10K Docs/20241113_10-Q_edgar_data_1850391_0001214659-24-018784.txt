CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that involve risks and uncertainties
and are subject to change based on various important factors, many of which may be beyond our control. In some cases, you can identify
forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, expect, intend, 
 plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential 
or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) included in
this quarterly report that address activities, events or developments that will or may occur in the future, including such matters as
movements in the cryptocurrencies markets and indexes that track such movements, the Trust s operations, the Sponsor s plans
and references to the Trust s future success and other similar matters, are forward-looking statements. These statements are only
predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses the Sponsor
has made based on its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate
in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsor s expectations and predictions,
however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the special considerations discussed in this quarterly report and
 Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 general economic, market and
business conditions, changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory
bodies, and other world economic and political developments. Consequently, all the forward-looking statements made in this quarterly report
are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that actual results or developments the Sponsor anticipates
will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the expected consequences to, or have the expected effects
on, the Trust s operations or the value of its Shares. 

Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise
requires, the terms we, our and us in this quarterly report refer to the Trust.

table in the Schedule of Investment. 

For the three and nine months ended September

daily net asset value. The Sponsor Fee will accrue and be payable in U.S. dollars. The Trust s only ordinary recurring expense is
expected to be the Sponsor Fee. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume the marketing and the following
administrative expenses of the Trust: the fees of the Trustee, the Trust Administrator, Fund Accountant, Transfer Agent, the Marketing
Agent, Coinbase Custody Trust Company LLC (the Bitcoin Custodian ), the Cash Custodians Fee, Exchange listing fees,
SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, tax reporting fees, audit fees, license fees and ordinary legal fees and expenses.
The Sponsor will also pay the costs of the Trust s organization and the initial sale of the Shares. There is no cap on the amount
of these Sponsor paid expenses. 

For the period that commenced on January 11, 2024
through July 11, 2024, the After the close of business
on July 11, 2024, the waiver expired and was not renewed. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Sponsor waived 
and of its fee, respectively. 

The Trust may incur certain non-recurring expenses
that are not assumed by the Sponsor, including but not limited to, taxes and governmental charges, any applicable brokerage commissions,
financing charges or fees, bitcoin network fees and similar transaction fees, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed
by the Sponsor (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust or the interests of Shareholders (including,
for example, in connection with any fork of the bitcoin blockchain), any indemnification of the Cash Custodian, Bitcoin Custodian, Trust
Administrator or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Trust and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any
legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters. 

The Trust does not have any income and will need
to sell bitcoin at the price available through Coinbase Inc. (the Prime Execution Agent to cover the Sponsor s Fee
and expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, if any. The Trust is responsible for paying any costs associated with the transfer of bitcoin
to the Sponsor or the sale of bitcoin. Under the terms of each Authorized Participant Agreement, the Authorized Participants will be responsible
for any brokerage or transaction costs associated with the sale or transfer of bitcoin incurred in connection with the fulfillment of
a creation and redemption order. Brokerage or transaction costs associated with the sale or transfer of bitcoin are recorded by the Trust
as a reduction of realized gain or an increase in realized loss from investment in bitcoin on the Statement of Operations. Reimbursements
of brokerage or transaction costs by an Authorized Participant are included in the capital share transactions activity shown on the Statements
of Changes in Net Assets as an increase to Net proceeds from sale of shares or a decrease to Cost of shares
redeemed . The Trust may also be subject to other liabilities (for example, as a result of litigation) that have also not been
assumed by the Sponsor. 

To cover the Sponsor s Fee and expenses
not assumed by the Sponsor, the Sponsor or its delegate will cause the Trust (or its delegate) to convert bitcoin into U.S. dollars at
the price available through the Prime Execution Agent. The number of bitcoins represented by a Share will decline each time the Trust
pays the Sponsor fee or any Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor by transferring or selling bitcoins. 

 shares or of the outstanding Shares of the Trust. As of September 30, 2024, WisdomTree, Inc. owned shares or of
the outstanding Shares of the Trust. 

Authorized Participants are the
only persons that may place orders to create or redeem Baskets. Each Authorized Participant must (i) be a registered broker-dealer or
other securities market participant, such as a bank or other financial institution that is not required to register as a broker-dealer
to engage in securities transactions, (ii) be a participant in The Depository Trust Company, and (iii) have entered into an Authorized
Participant Agreement with the Trust. 

The total deposit of cash required to create
each Basket includes the cash equivalent of an amount of bitcoin that is in the same proportion to the total assets of the Trust less
any accrued but unpaid expenses and liabilities. In order to calculate the amount of cash necessary for a creation Basket, the Trust
administrator multiplies the NAV per share by the number of Shares in a creation Basket (5,000). Each night, the Sponsor or Trust administrator
publish the amount of cash that will be required in exchange for each creation Basket the next business day. To the extent there is a
difference between the price actually paid by the Trust to acquire a Creation Basket worth of bitcoin in the creation process compared
to the cash value of the Creation Basket i.e ., if there is a difference between the amount paid by the Execution Agent on behalf
of the Trust to purchase the requisite amount of bitcoin and the valuation of bitcoin as part of the Trust s NAV calculation),
that difference will also be charged to the creating Authorized Participant in the form of a variable fee. 

NAV per Share for purposes of facilitating creations
and redemptions of the Trust is computed each business day using the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate New York Variant (the Reference
Rate as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time to value the Trust s investment in bitcoin. The methodology of the Reference Rate used
to value bitcoin for purposes of calculating NAV per Share may not be deemed consistent with GAAP and may be different from the value
of bitcoin used in the Trust s GAAP financial statements.

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our unaudited financial
statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report ), which have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). The following discussion
may contain forward-looking statements based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Our actual results could differ materially from
those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not
limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, 
and the risks described in the in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2023. 

Overview 

The Trust is an exchange-traded fund that issues
Shares that are traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the Exchange ). The Trust s investment objective is to gain
exposure to the price of bitcoin as represented by the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate New York Variant (the Reference Rate ),
less expenses and liabilities of the Trust s operations. In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust holds bitcoin
and values its Shares daily based on the Reference Rate, which is based on an aggregation of executed trade flow of major bitcoin platforms.
On January 11, 2024, the Shares commenced trading on the Exchange under the ticker symbol BTCW . 

The following discussion and analysis was prepared
to supplement information contained in the accompanying financial statements and is intended to explain certain items regarding the Trust s
financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. It
should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this Quarterly Report. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Fair Value Determination 

The Trust s investment in bitcoin is recorded
on the financial statements at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 ). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell
the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal
market, in the most advantageous market for the asset for liability. ASC 820 defines principal market as the market with
the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability. The determination of the principal market (and, as a result, the
market participants in the principal market) is made from the perspective of the reporting entity. ASC 820 defines most advantageous
market as the market that maximizes the amount that would be received to sell the asset or minimizes the amount that would be paid
to transfer the liability, after taking into account transaction costs and transportation costs. Based on the foregoing, the Trust has
determined its principal market for GAAP reporting for its bitcoin investment to be the bitcoin platform operated by Coinbase, Inc. and
utilizes an exchange-traded price from that principal market as of 11:59:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the financial statement measurement
date. The Sponsor will perform other procedures (consistent with GAAP) to value an investment in bitcoin when a market quote is not available.

at September 30, 2024 and total return (based on NAV per Share) for the nine-month period was 35.20 (0.43 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the 154,134,881 net increase in net assets resulted from the aforementioned
bitcoin price appreciation, net investment loss, net realized gain and by 144,115,558 of net increase resulting from capital share transactions.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 235,861,375 net increase in net assets resulted from the aforementioned bitcoin price
appreciation, net investment loss, net realized gain and by 217,426,115 of net increase resulting from capital share transactions. 

Net Asset Value 

The Trust s NAV per Share is calculated
by: 

taking the Trust s total assets including, but not limited to, the market value of bitcoin, carrying amount of cash or other assets; 

subtracting any liabilities; and 

dividing that total by the total number of outstanding Shares. 

The methodology of the Reference Rate used to
value bitcoin for purposes of calculating NAV per Share may not be deemed consistent with GAAP and may be different from the value of
bitcoin used in the Trust s GAAP financial statements. To the extent the methodology used to calculate the Reference Rate is deemed
not to be consistent with GAAP, the Trust will utilize an alternative GAAP-consistent pricing source for purposes of the Trust s
periodic financial statements, as further discussed below. 

The Trust Administrator calculates the NAV of
the Trust once each Exchange trading day. The NAV for a normal trading day will be released after 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Trading
during the core trading session on the Exchange typically closes at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. However, NAVs are not officially
struck until later in the day (often by 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and almost always by 8:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time). 

14 

The Sponsor believes that the Reference Rate is
reflective of a reasonable valuation of the average spot price of bitcoin. However, in the event the Reference Rate is not available or
is determined by the Sponsor to not be reliable, the Sponsor will fair value the Trust s bitcoin holdings. The Sponsor
does not anticipate that the need to fair value bitcoin will be a common occurrence. The Sponsor reserves the right to replace
the Reference Rate with another valuation methodology which it believes will accurately track the price of bitcoin. If the Sponsor makes
the decision to materially change the valuation methodology or replace either the Reference Rate or the Benchmark Administrator, the Sponsor
will notify Shareholders via a posting on the Trust s website, prospectus supplement, post-effective amendment, through a current
report on Form 8-K or in the Trust s annual or quarterly reports. 

The Sponsor publishes the NAV, NAV per Share and
the Trust s bitcoin holdings at www.wisdomtree.com/investments after their determination and availability. Reference Rate data and
the description of the Reference Rate are based on information made publicly available by the Benchmark Administrator on its website at
https://www.cfbenchmarks.com. 

As of September 30, 2024 (the last business day),
the Trust had a net closing balance of 3,705.4872 bitcoins with a value of 234,967,352 based on the Reference Rate Price of 63,410.65,
which is calculated pursuant to non-GAAP methodology. As of September 30, 2024, the total market value of the Trust s bitcoin was
 235,956,643, based on the price of a bitcoin in the principal market of 63,677.63. For the three- and nine-month period ended September
30, 2024, the Trust determined that Coinbase was its principal market. 

The following chart illustrates the movement in
the Market Price per Share and the Trust s NAV per Share from January 11, 2024, the date the Trust was listed on the Exchange, to
September 30, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands,
conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. 

The
Trust will pay the Sponsor a unified fee of 0.25 per annum of the Trust s average daily NAV (the Sponsor Fee as compensation for services performed under the Trust Agreement. The Trust s only ordinary recurring expense is expected to
be the Sponsor Fee. For the period commencing on January 11, 2024 (the day the Trust s Shares were initially listed on the
Exchange) through July 11, 2024, the Sponsor waived the entire Sponsor Fee on the first 1.0 billion of Trust assets. After the
close of business on July 11, 2024, the waiver expired and was not renewed. 

Except for
periods during which all or a portion of the Sponsor Fee was waived, the Sponsor Fee will accrue and be payable in U.S. dollars. In exchange
for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume the marketing and the following administrative expenses of the Trust: the
fees of the Trustee, the Trust Administrator, Fund Accountant, Transfer Agent, the Marketing Agent ,
the Bitcoin Custodian, the Cash Custodians Fee, Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, tax reporting
fees, audit fees, license fees and ordinary legal fees and expenses. The Sponsor will also pay the costs of the Trust s organization
and the initial sale of the Shares. There is no cap on the amount of these Sponsor paid expenses. 

The Sponsor may, at its sole discretion and from
time to time, waive all or a portion of the Sponsor Fee for stated periods of time. The Sponsor is under no obligation to waive any portion
of its fees and any such waiver shall create no obligation to waive any such fees during any period not covered by the waiver. 

The Trust may incur certain non-recurring expenses
that are not assumed by the Sponsor, including but not limited to, taxes and governmental charges, any applicable brokerage commissions,
financing charges or fees, bitcoin network fees and similar transaction fees, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed
by the Sponsor (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust or the interests of Shareholders (including,
for example, in connection with any fork of the bitcoin blockchain), any indemnification of the Cash Custodian, Bitcoin Custodian, Trust
Administrator or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Trust and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any
legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters. 

Because the Trust does not have any income, it
will need to sell bitcoin to cover the Sponsor s Fee and expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, if any. The Trust may also be subject
to other liabilities (for example, as a result of litigation) that have also not been assumed by the Sponsor. The only source of funds
to cover those liabilities will be sales of bitcoin held by the Trust. Even if there are no expenses other than those assumed by the Sponsor,
and there are no other liabilities of the Trust, the Trust will still need to sell bitcoin to pay the Sponsor s Fee. 

16 

To cover the Sponsor s Fee and expenses
not assumed by the Sponsor, the Sponsor or its delegate will cause the Trust (or its delegate) to convert bitcoin into U.S. dollars at
the price available through the Prime Execution Agent. The number of bitcoins represented by a Share will decline each time the Trust
pays the Sponsor Fee or any Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor by transferring or selling bitcoins. The Trust is responsible for
paying any costs associated with the transfer of bitcoin to the Sponsor or the sale of bitcoin. However, under the terms of each Authorized
Participant Agreement, the Authorized Participants will be responsible for any brokerage or transaction costs associated with the sale
or transfer of bitcoin incurred in connection with the fulfillment of a creation or redemption order. 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to
Shareholders.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 

The Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its 1934 Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of the Sponsor to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer of the Sponsor, the Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trust s
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under 1934 Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer
and the Principal Financial Officer of the Sponsor concluded that, as of September 30, 2024 the Trust s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in the Trust s internal
controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls.
