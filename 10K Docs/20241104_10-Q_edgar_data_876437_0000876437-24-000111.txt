 Quota share reinsurance 
 We have entered into QSR Transactions with panels of third-party reinsurers to cede a fixed percentage of premiums earned and received and losses incurred on insurance covered by the transactions. We receive the benefit of a ceding commission equal to of premiums ceded before profit commission. We also receive the benefit of a profit commission through a reduction of premiums we cede. The profit commission varies inversely with the level of losses on a dollar for dollar basis and can be eliminated at certain annual loss ratios as defined below. Ceded losses incurred are impacted by the delinquencies covered by our QSR Transactions, our estimates of payments that will be ultimately made on those delinquencies, and claim payments covered by our QSR Transactions. 
 
 Each of our QSR Transactions typically have annual loss ratio caps of and lifetime loss ratio caps of .

 (1) We can elect early termination of the QSR Transaction beginning on this date, and semi-annually thereafter. 
 (2) We can elect to reduce the quota share percentage beginning on this date, and semi-annually thereafter. 
 (3) We have elected to terminate our 2021 QSR transaction effective December 31, 2024, and we expect to incur an early termination fee in the fourth quarter of approximately million. 
 
 We have agreed upon terms of a QSR transaction with a group of unaffiliated reinsurers covering most of our new insurance written in 2025 and 2026. 
 
 Under the terms of our QSR Transactions, ceded premiums earned, ceding commissions, profit commission, and ceded paid loss and LAE are settled net on a quarterly basis. The ceded premiums earned due, after deducting the related ceding commission and profit commission, is reported within Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The reinsurance recoverable on loss reserves related to our QSR Transactions was million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. The reinsurance recoverable balance is secured by funds on deposit from reinsurers (which does not include letters of credit), the minimum amount of which is based on the greater of 1) a reinsurer's funding requirements under PMIERs or 2) ceded reserves and unpaid losses. Each of the reinsurers under our QSR Transactions described above has an insurer financial strength rating of A- or better (or a comparable rating) by Standard and Poor's Rating Services, A.M. Best, Moody's, or a combination of the three. 
 
 Excess of loss reinsurance 
 We have XOL Transactions with a panel of unaffiliated reinsurers executed through the traditional reinsurance market Traditional XOL Transactions and with unaffiliated special purpose insurers Home Re Transactions ). 
 
 For policies covered under our Traditional XOL Transactions, we retain the first layer of the aggregate losses paid, and the reinsurers will then provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. We retain losses paid in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. The reinsurance coverage is subject to adjustment based on the risk characteristics of the covered loans until the initial excess of loss reinsurance coverage layer has been finalized. 
 
 We can elect to terminate our Traditional XOL Transactions under specified scenarios without penalty upon prior written notice, including if we will receive less than the full credit amount under the PMIERs, full financial statement credit or full credit under applicable regulatory capital requirements for the risk ceded in any required calculation period. The reinsurance premiums ceded under the Traditional XOL Transactions are based off the remaining reinsurance coverage levels. The reinsured coverage levels are secured by funds on deposit from reinsurers (which does not include letters of credit), the minimum amount of which is based on the greater of 1) a reinsurer's funding requirements under PMIERs or 2) ceded reserves and unpaid losses. Each of the reinsurers under our Traditional XOL Transactions has an insurer financial strength rating of A- or better (or a comparable rating) by Standard and Poor s Rating Services, A.M. Best, Moody s, or a combination of the three. 
 
 The Home Re Transactions are executed with unaffiliated special purpose insurers Home Re Entities ). For the reinsurance coverage periods, we retain the first layer of the respective aggregate losses paid, and a Home Re Entity will then provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. We retain losses paid in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. Subject to certain conditions, the reinsurance coverage decreases as the underlying covered mortgages amortize or are repaid, or mortgage insurance losses are paid.

 (1) The initial and remaining excess of loss reinsurance coverage is reduced by the applicable funding percentage. 
 (2) The funding percentage represents the aggregate outstanding note balances divided by the aggregate ending coverage amounts. 
 (3) The funding percentage on the 2021-2 and 2019-1 were reduced from after the tender offers were conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 The reinsurance premiums ceded to each Home Re Entity are composed of coverage, initial expense and supplemental premiums. The coverage premiums are generally calculated as the difference between the amount of interest payable by the Home Re Entity on the remaining reinsurance coverage levels, and the investment income collected on the collateral assets held in a reinsurance trust account and used to collateralize the Home Re Entity s reinsurance obligation to MGIC. The amount of monthly reinsurance coverage premium ceded will fluctuate due to changes in the reference rate and changes in money market rates that affect investment income collected on the assets in the reinsurance trust. As a result, we concluded that each Home Re Transaction contains an embedded derivative that is accounted for separately as a freestanding derivative. The fair values of the derivatives at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were not material to our consolidated balance sheet and the change in fair value during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were not material to our consolidated statements of operations. (See Note 7 - Investments and Note 8 - Fair Value Measurements .) 
 
 At the time the Home Re Transactions were entered into, we concluded that each Home Re Entity is a variable interest entity VIE ). A VIE is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to make sufficient decisions relating to the entity s operations through voting rights or do not substantively participate in gains and losses of the entity. Given that MGIC (1) does not have the unilateral power to direct the activities that most significantly affect each Home Re Entity s economic performance and (2) does not have the obligation, outside the terms of the reinsurance agreement, to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of each Home Re Entity that could be significant to the Home Re Entity, consolidation of the Home Re Entities is not required. 
 
 We are required to disclose our maximum exposure to loss, which we consider to be an amount that we could be required to record in our statements of operations, as a result of our involvement with the VIEs under our Home Re Transactions. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we did not have material exposure to the VIEs as we have no investment in the VIEs and had no reinsurance claim payments due from the VIEs under our reinsurance transactions. We are unable to determine the timing or extent of claims from losses that are ceded under the reinsurance transactions. The VIE assets are deposited in reinsurance trusts for the benefit of MGIC that will be the source of reinsurance claim payments to MGIC. The purpose of the reinsurance trusts is to provide security to MGIC for the obligations of the VIEs under the reinsurance transactions. The trustee of the reinsurance trusts, a recognized provider of corporate trust services, has established segregated accounts within the reinsurance trusts for the benefit of MGIC, pursuant to the trust agreements. The trust agreements are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. If the trustee of the reinsurance trusts failed to distribute claim payments to us as provided in the reinsurance trusts, we would incur a loss related to our losses ceded under the reinsurance transactions and deemed unrecoverable. We are also unable to determine the impact such possible failure by the trustee to perform pursuant to the reinsurance trust agreements may have on our consolidated financial statements. As a result, we are unable to quantify our maximum exposure to loss related to our involvement with the VIEs. MGIC has certain termination rights under the reinsurance transactions should its claims not be paid. We consider our exposure to loss from our reinsurance transactions with the VIEs to be remote.

 There were and securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe the unrealized losses as of September 30, 2024 presented in table 7.5a above are not indicative of the ultimate collectability of the current amortized cost of the securities. The unrealized losses in all categories of our investments at September 30, 2024 were primarily caused by an increase in prevailing interest rates. We also rely upon estimates of several credit and non-credit factors in our review and evaluation of individual investments to determine whether a credit impairment exists. All of the securities in an unrealized loss position are current with respect to their interest obligations.

 In addition to the assets carried at fair value discussed above, we have embedded derivatives carried at fair value related to our Home Re Transactions that are classified as Other liabilities or Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The estimated fair value related to our embedded derivatives reflects the present value impact of the variation in investment income on the assets held by the reinsurance trusts and the contractual reference rate on the Home Re Transactions used to calculate the reinsurance premiums we estimate we will pay over the estimated remaining life. These liabilities or assets are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 The Losses incurred section of table 11.1 below shows losses incurred on delinquencies that occurred in the current year and in prior years. The amount of losses incurred relating to delinquencies that occurred in the current year represents the estimated amount to be ultimately paid on such delinquencies. The amount of losses incurred relating to delinquencies that occurred in prior years represents the difference between the actual claim rate and claim severity associated with those delinquencies resolved in the current year compared to the estimated claim rate and claim severity at the prior year-end, as well as a re-estimation of amounts to be ultimately paid on delinquencies continuing from the end of the prior year. This re-estimation of the claim rate and claim severity is the result of our review of current trends in the delinquency inventory, such as percentages of delinquencies that have resulted in a claim, the amount of the claims relative to the average loan exposure, changes in the relative level of delinquencies by geography and changes in average loan exposure.

 The increase in the current year losses incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to an increase in estimated severity on current year delinquencies and an increase in new delinquencies reported. 
 
 The favorable loss development on previously received delinquencies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from a decrease in the expected claim rate on previously received delinquencies.

Note 14. 
 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, our domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to the RIF (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. We refer to these requirements as the State Capital Requirements and, together with the GSE Financial Requirements, as the Financial Requirements. While they vary among jurisdictions, the most common State Capital Requirements allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of . A risk-to-capital ratio will increase if (i) the percentage decrease in capital exceeds the percentage decrease in insured risk, or (ii) the percentage increase in capital is less than the percentage increase in insured risk. Wisconsin does not regulate capital by using a risk-to-capital measure but instead requires a minimum policyholder position MPP ). MGIC s policyholder position includes its net worth or surplus, and its contingency loss reserve. Our policyholders position was above the required MPP and our risk-to-capital ratio was below the maximum allowed by jurisdictions with State Capital Requirements at September 30, 2024. 
 
 In 2023, the NAIC adopted a revised Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. The updated Model Act includes requirements relating to, among other things: (i) capital and minimum capital requirements, and contingency reserves; (ii) restrictions on mortgage insurers investments in notes secured by mortgages; (iii) prudent underwriting standards and formal underwriting guidelines; (iv) the establishment of formal, internal Mortgage Guaranty Quality Control Programs with respect to in-force business; and (v) reinsurance and prohibitions on captive reinsurance arrangements. It is uncertain when the revised Model Act will be adopted in any jurisdiction. It is unknown whether any changes will be made by state legislatures prior to adoption, and the effect changes, if any, will have on the mortgage guaranty insurance market generally, or on our business. Wisconsin has begun the process to replace current MI regulations with the Model Act, though it is expected that some changes will be made before formal adoption. 
 
 Dividend restrictions 
 MGIC is subject to statutory regulations as to payment of dividends. The maximum amount of dividends that MGIC may pay in any twelve-month period without regulatory approval by the OCI is the lesser of adjusted statutory net income or of statutory policyholders surplus as of the preceding calendar year end. Adjusted statutory net income is defined for this purpose to be the greater of statutory net income, net of realized investment gains, for the calendar year preceding the date of the dividend or statutory net income, net of realized investment gains, for the three calendar years preceding the date of the dividend less dividends paid within the first two of the preceding three calendar years. The maximum dividend that could be paid, without regulatory approval, is reduced by dividends paid in the twelve months preceding the dividend payment date. Before making any dividend payments, we notify the OCI to ensure it does not object. In 2024, MGIC has paid dividends of million and million to the holding company in October and April, respectively. 
 
 Statutory Financial Information 
 The OCI recognizes only statutory accounting principles prescribed, or practices permitted by the State of Wisconsin for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company. The OCI has adopted certain prescribed accounting practices that differ from those found in other states. Specifically, Wisconsin domiciled companies record changes in the contingency loss reserves through their income statement as a change in underwriting deduction. As a result, in periods in which MGIC is increasing contingency loss reserves, statutory net income is reduced.

 Summary of third quarter 2024 results 
 Comparative quarterly results 
 We recorded third quarter 2024 net income of 200.0 million, or 0.77 per diluted share. Net income increased by 17.1 million from net income of 182.8 million, or 0.64 per diluted share, in the prior year. The increase is primarily due a decrease in losses incurred, net and an increase in investment income, net of expenses. This was offset partially by an increase in provision for income taxes. Diluted income per share increased primarily due to an increase in net income and a decrease in the number of diluted weighted shares outstanding. 
 
 Adjusted net operating income for the third quarter 2024 was 200.7 million (Q3 2023: 183.0 million) and adjusted net operating income per diluted share was 0.77 (Q3 2023: 0.64). The increase in adjusted net operating income primarily reflects an increase in net income. The increase in adjusted net operating income per diluted share primarily reflects an increase in adjusted net operating income and a decrease in the number of diluted weighted shares outstanding. 
 
 Net investment income in the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 62.1 million, compared with 55.4 million, in the prior year. The increase in net investment income was due to an increase of 38 basis points in the average investment yields. 
 
 Losses incurred, net for the third quarter of 2024 were 9.8) million, compared with 0.1) million for the same period last year. While new delinquency notices added approximately 55.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, our re-estimation of loss reserves on previously received delinquency notices resulted in favorable development of approximately 65.6 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, new delinquency notices added approximately 48.1 million, offset by our re-estimation of loss reserves on previously received delinquency notices resulting in favorable development of approximately 48.2 million. The favorable development for both periods primarily resulted from a decrease in the expected claim rate on previously received delinquencies. Home price appreciation experienced in recent years has allowed some borrowers to cure their delinquencies through the sale of their property. 
 
 The increase in our provision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in income before tax. 
 
 Comparative year to date results 
 We recorded net income of 578.3 million, or 2.17 per diluted share. Net income increased by 49.8 million from net income of 528.4 million, or 1.83 per diluted share in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in investment income, net of expenses, a decrease in losses incurred and a decrease in other underwriting and operating expenses, net. This was partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes. Diluted income per share increased primarily due to an increase in net income and a decrease in the number of diluted weighted shares outstanding. 

MGIC Investment Corporation - Q3 2024 | 35 

Adjusted net operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 584.0 million (2023: 536.8 million) and adjusted net operating income per diluted share was 2.19 (2023: 1.86). The increase in adjusted net operating income primarily reflects an increase in net income. The increase in adjusted net operating income per diluted share primarily reflects an increase in adjusted net operating income and a decrease in the number of diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
 
 Net investment income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 183.3 million, compared with 156.9 million in the prior year. The increase in net investment income was due to an increase of 49 bps in the average investment yields. 
 
 Losses incurred, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 23.6) million, compared with 11.3) million for the same period last year. While new delinquency notices added approximately 158.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our re-estimation of loss reserves on previously received delinquency notices resulted in favorable development of approximately 181.9 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, new delinquency notices added approximately 137.6 million, offset by our re-estimation of loss reserves on previously received delinquency notices resulting in favorable development of approximately 148.9 million. The favorable development for both periods primarily resulted from a decrease in the expected claim rate on previously received delinquencies. Home price appreciation experienced in recent years has allowed some borrowers to cure their delinquencies through the sale of their property. 
 
 Underwriting and other expenses, net in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 162.7 million, compared with 174.2 million for the same period last year. The decrease in underwriting and other expenses, net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in pension expenses and a decrease in expenses related to professional and consulting services. Pension expenses were higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to settlement accounting charges. 
 
 The increase in our provision for income taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in income before tax. 
 
 Capital 
 MGIC dividend payments to our holding company 
 The ability of MGIC to pay dividends is restricted by insurance regulation. Amounts in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and may not be paid if disapproved by the OCI. A dividend is extraordinary when the proposed dividend amount, plus dividends paid in the twelve months preceding the dividend payment date exceed the ordinary dividend level. In 2024, MGIC can pay 64 million of ordinary dividends without OCI approval, before taking into consideration dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we made dividend payments to the holding company of 350 million and 300 million respectively. Future dividend payments to the holding company will continue to be determined in consultation with the board and after considering any updated estimates about our business, subject to regulatory approval. In October 2024, MGIC paid a 400 million dividends to our holding company. 
 
 Share repurchase programs 
 Repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market (including through 10b5-1 plans) or through privately negotiated transactions. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and for the full year of 2023, we repurchased 17.5 million and 21.7 million shares of common stock, for 373.2 million and 340.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had 651 million of remaining authorization to repurchase our common stock through December 31, 2026 under a 750 million share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in April 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 256 million shares of common stock outstanding. 
 
 Dividends to shareholders 
 In the first and second quarters of 2024, we paid quarterly cash dividends of 0.115 per share which totaled 63.3 million. In the third quarter, we paid quarterly cash dividends of 0.13 per share which totaled 34.2 million. On October 24, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of the company s common stock of 0.13 per share to shareholders of record on November 7, 2024. 
 
 GSEs 
 We must comply with a GSE s PMIERs to be eligible to insure loans delivered to or purchased by that GSE. The PMIERs include financial requirements, as well as business, quality control and certain transaction approval requirements. The PMIERs provide that the GSEs may amend any provision of the PMIERs or impose additional requirements with an effective date specified by the GSEs. 
 
 The financial requirements of the PMIERs require a mortgage insurer s "Available Assets" (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) to equal or exceed its "Minimum Required Assets" (which are generally based on an insurer's book of risk in force and calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions, reduced for credit given for risk ceded under reinsurance agreements). Based on our interpretation of the PMIERs as of September 30, 2024, MGIC s Available Assets totaled 6.0 billion, or 2.5 billion in excess of its Minimum Required Assets. MGIC is in compliance with the PMIERs and eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. In August 2024, the GSEs issued updates to the calculation of Available Assets. The update will be implemented through a 24-month phased-in approach, with a fully effective date of September 30, 2026. If these changes were effective as of September 30, 2024, without a graduated implementation period, MGIC's Available Assets of 6.0 billion would decrease by approximately 1 or 50 million, and MGIC's PMIERs excess would be 2.5 billion. 
 
 MGIC Investment Corporation - Q3 2024 | 36 

The PMIERs generally require us to hold significantly more Minimum Required Assets for delinquent loans than for performing loans and the Minimum Required Assets required to be held increases as the number of payments missed on a delinquent loan increases. 
 
 Our reinsurance transactions enable us to earn higher returns on our Minimum Required Assets than we would without them because they generally reduce the Minimum Required Assets we must hold under PMIERs. However, reinsurance may not always be available to us, or available only on terms, or costs, that we find unacceptable. 
 
 The calculated credit for XOL Transactions under PMIERs is generally based on the PMIERs requirement of the covered loans and the attachment and detachment point of the coverage. PMIERs credit is generally not given for the reinsured risk above the PMIERs requirement. Our existing reinsurance transactions are subject to periodic review by the GSEs and there is a risk we will not receive our current level of credit in future periods for the risk ceded under them. In addition, we may not receive the same level of credit under future transactions that we receive under existing transactions. If MGIC is not allowed certain levels of credit under the PMIERs, under certain circumstances, MGIC may terminate the reinsurance transactions without penalties. 
 
 For additional information about our reinsurance transactions, see our Risk Factor titled Reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, and/or the GSEs may reduce the amount of capital credit we receive for our reinsurance transactions. 
 
 GSE reform 
 The FHFA has been the conservator of the GSEs since 2008 and has the authority to control and direct their operations. Given that the Director of the FHFA is removable by the President at will, the agency s agenda, policies, and actions are influenced by then-current administration. The increased role that the federal government has assumed in the residential housing finance system through the GSE conservatorships may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the GSEs change, including through administration changes and actions. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 It is uncertain what role the GSEs, FHA and private capital, including private mortgage insurance, will play in the residential housing finance system in the future. The timing and impact on our business of any resulting changes is uncertain. Many of the proposed changes would require Congressional action to implement and it is difficult to estimate when Congressional action would be final and how long any associated phase-in period may last. 
 
 For additional information about the business practices of the GSEs, see our Risk Factor titled Changes in the business practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ("the GSEs") , federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses. 
 
 State Regulations 
 The insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, our domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its RIF (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. We refer to these requirements as the State Capital Requirements. While they vary among jurisdictions, the most common State Capital Requirements allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25 to 1. A risk-to-capital ratio will increase if (i) the percentage decrease in capital exceeds the percentage decrease in insured risk, or (ii) the percentage increase in capital is less than the percentage increase in insured risk. Wisconsin does not regulate capital by using a risk-to-capital measure but instead requires a MPP. MGIC s policyholder position includes its net worth or surplus and its contingency reserve. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, MGIC s risk-to-capital ratio was 9.6 to 1, below the maximum allowed by the jurisdictions with State Capital Requirements, and its policyholder position was 3.9 billion above the required MPP of 2.2 billion. The calculation of our risk-to-capital ratio and MPP reflect full credit for the risk ceded under our reinsurance transactions. It is possible that under the revised State Capital Requirements discussed below, MGIC will not be allowed full credit for the risk ceded under such transactions. If MGIC is not allowed an agreed level of credit under either the State Capital Requirements or the PMIERs, MGIC may terminate the reinsurance transactions, without penalty. 
 
 In 2023, the NAIC adopted a revised Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. The updated Model Act includes requirements relating to, among other things: (i) capital and minimum capital requirements, and contingency reserves; (ii) restrictions on mortgage insurers investments in notes secured by mortgages; (iii) prudent underwriting standards and formal underwriting guidelines; (iv) the establishment of formal, internal Mortgage Guaranty Quality Control Programs with respect to in-force business; and (v) reinsurance and prohibitions on captive reinsurance arrangements. It is uncertain when the revised Model Act will be adopted in any jurisdiction. The provisions of the Model Act, if adopted in their final form, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. It is unknown whether any changes will be made by state legislatures prior to adoption, and the effect changes, if any, will have on the mortgage guaranty insurance market generally, or on our business. Wisconsin, where MGIC is domiciled, has begun the process to replace current MI regulations with the Model Act, though it is expected that some changes will be made before final adoption. 
 
 At this time, we expect MGIC to continue to comply with the current State Capital Requirements; however, refer to our risk factor titled State capital requirements may prevent us from continuing to write new insurance on an uninterrupted basis for more information about matters that could negatively impact our compliance with State Capital Requirements.

Factors affecting our results 
 Our current and future business, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates, home prices, housing demand, level of employment, inflation, pandemics, restrictions and costs on mortgage credit, and other factors. For additional information on how our business may be impacted see our Risk Factor titled Downturns in the domestic economy or declines in home prices may result in more homeowners defaulting and our losses increasing, with a corresponding decrease in our returns. 
 
 The future effects of climate change on our business are uncertain. For information about possible effects, please refer to our Risk Factor titled Pandemics, hurricanes and other disasters may impact our incurred losses, the amount and timing of paid claims, our inventory of notices of default and our Minimum Required Assets under PMIERs. 
 Our results of operations are affected by: 
 
 Premiums written and earned 
 Premiums written and earned in a year are influenced by: 
 
 NIW, which increases IIF. Many factors affect NIW, including the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations and competition to provide credit enhancement on those mortgages from the FHA, the VA, and other mortgage insurers. Other alternatives to mortgage insurance also impact NIW, including GSE programs that may reduce or eliminate the demand for mortgage insurance. NIW does not include loans previously insured by us that are modified, such as loans modified under HARP. 
 Cancellations, which reduce IIF. Cancellations may occur when borrowers achieve the required amount of home equity through loan amortization, loan payoffs, or home price appreciation. Refinance-related cancellations are influenced by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates throughout the in force book, current home values relative to values when the loans in the in force book were insured and the terms on which mortgage credit is available. Policy rescissions, also cause cancellations, requiring us to return any premiums received, from the date of default, on the rescinded policies and claim payments. Cancellations of single premium policies, which are generally non-refundable, result in immediate recognition of any remaining unearned premium. 
 Premium rates, which vary by product type, the risk characteristics of the insured loans, competitive pressures, the percentage of coverage on the insured loans, and PMIERs capital requirements. The substantial majority of our monthly and annual mortgage insurance premiums are under premium plans for which, for the first ten years of the policy, the amount of premium is determined by multiplying the initial premium rate by the original loan balance; thereafter, the premium rate resets to a lower rate used for the remaining life of the policy. The remainder of our monthly and annual premiums are under premium plans for which premiums are determined by a fixed percentage of the loan s amortizing balance over the life of the policy. 
 Premiums ceded, net of profit commission, under our QSR Transactions and premiums ceded under our XOL Transactions are primarily affected by the percentage of our IIF subject to our reinsurance transactions. The profit commission under our QSR Transactions also varies inversely with the level of ceded losses incurred on a dollar for dollar basis and can be eliminated at ceded loss levels higher than what we have experienced on our QSR Transactions. As a result, lower levels of losses incurred result in a higher profit commission and less benefit from ceded losses incurred; higher levels of losses incurred result in more benefit from ceded losses incurred and a lower profit commission (or for certain levels of accident year loss ratios, its elimination). (See Note 4 - Reinsurance to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our reinsurance transactions.) 
 
 Premiums earned are generated by the insurance that is in force during all or a portion of the period. A change in the average IIF in the current period compared to an earlier period is a factor that will increase (when the average in force is higher) or reduce (when it is lower) premiums written and earned in the current period, although this effect may be enhanced (or mitigated) by the factors discussed above. 
 
 Investment income 
 Our investment portfolio is composed principally of investment grade fixed income securities. The principal factors that influence investment income are the size of the portfolio and its yield. As measured by amortized cost (which excludes changes in fair value, such as from changes in interest rates), the size of the investment portfolio is mainly a function of cash generated from (or used in) operations, such as net premiums written, investment income, net claim payments and expenses, and cash provided by (or used for) non-operating activities, such as debt or stock issuances or repurchases, and dividends. 
 
 Losses incurred 
 Losses incurred are the current expense that reflects claim payments, costs of settling claims, and changes in our estimates of payments that will ultimately be made as a result of delinquencies on insured loans. As explained under Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 10-K MD A, except in the case of a premium deficiency reserve, we recognize an estimate of this expense only for delinquent loans. The level of new delinquencies has historically followed a seasonal pattern, with new delinquencies in the first part of the year lower than new delinquencies in the latter part of the year. The state of the economy, local housing markets and various other factors, including pandemics, may result in delinquencies not following the typical pattern. Losses incurred are generally affected by: 
 
 The state of the economy, including unemployment and housing values, each of which affects the likelihood that loans will become delinquent and whether loans that are delinquent cure their delinquency. 
 
 MGIC Investment Corporation - Q3 2024 | 38 

The product mix of the in force book, with loans having higher risk characteristics generally resulting in higher delinquencies and claims. 
 The size of loans insured, with higher average loan amounts on delinquent loans tending to increase incurred losses. 
 The percentage of coverage on insured loans, with deeper average coverage on delinquent loans tending to increase incurred losses. 
 The distribution of claims over the life of a book. Historically, the first few years after loans are originated are a period of relatively low claims, with claims increasing substantially for several years subsequent and then declining. Annual persistency, the condition of the economy, including unemployment and housing prices, and other factors can affect this pattern. For example, a weak economy or housing value declines can lead to claims from older books increasing, continuing at stable levels or experiencing a lower rate of decline. See further information under Mortgage insurance earnings and cash flow cycle below. 
 Losses ceded under reinsurance transactions. See Note 4 - Reinsurance to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our reinsurance transactions. 
 The rate at which we rescind policies or curtail claims. Our estimated loss reserves incorporate our estimates of future rescissions of policies and curtailments of claims, and reversals of rescissions and curtailments. We collectively refer to such rescissions and denials as rescissions and variations of this term. We call reductions to claims curtailments. 
 
 Underwriting and other expenses 
 Underwriting and other expenses includes items such as employee compensation, fees for professional and consulting services, depreciation and maintenance expense, and premium taxes, and are reported net of ceding commissions associated with our QSR Transactions. Employee compensation expenses are variable due to share-based compensation, changes in benefits, and changes in headcount (which can fluctuate due to volume of NIW). See Note 4 - Reinsurance to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of ceding commission on our QSR Transactions. 
 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense reflects the interest associated with our outstanding debt obligations discussed in Note 3 - Debt to our consolidated financial statements and under Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 
 
 Other 
 Certain activities that we do not consider being part of our fundamental operating activities may also impact our results of operations and are described below. 
 Gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments 
 Fixed income securities. Investment gains and losses reflect the difference between the amount received on the sale of a fixed income security and the fixed income security s cost basis, as well as any credit allowances and any impairments on securities we intend to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. The amount received on the sale of fixed income securities is affected by the coupon rate of the security compared to the yield of comparable securities at the time of sale. 
 Equity securities. Investment gains and losses reflect the periodic change in fair value. 
 Financial instruments. Investment gains and losses on the embedded derivative on our Home Re Transactions reflect the present value impact of the variation in investment income on assets on the insurance-linked notes held by the reinsurance trusts and the contractual reference rate used to calculate the reinsurance premiums we estimate we will pay over the estimated remaining life. 
 
 Gains and losses on debt extinguishment 
 Gains and losses on debt extinguishment result from discretionary activities that are undertaken to enhance our capital position, and/or improve our debt profile. Extinguishing our outstanding debt obligations early through these discretionary activities may result in gains or losses primarily driven by differences in the payment of consideration from the carrying value, and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs on the extinguished portion of the debt. 
 
 Refer to Explanation and reconciliation of our use of Non-GAAP financial measures below to understand how these items impact our evaluation of our core financial performance. 

MGIC Investment Corporation - Q3 2024 | 39 

Mortgage insurance earnings and cash flow cycle 
 In general, the majority of any underwriting profit that a book generates occurs in the early years of the book, with the largest portion of any underwriting profit realized in the first year following the year the book was written. Subsequent years of a book may result in either underwriting profit or underwriting losses. This pattern of results typically occurs because relatively few of the incurred losses on delinquencies that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years of the book, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments) and increasing losses. The state of the economy, local housing markets and various other factors may result in delinquencies not following the typical pattern. 
 
 Cybersecurity 
 As part of our business, we maintain large amounts of confidential and proprietary information both on our own servers and those of cloud computing services. This includes personal information of consumers and our employees. Personal information is subject to an increasing number of federal and state laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Any failure or perceived failure by us, or by the vendors with whom we share this information, to comply with such obligations may result in damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs, regulatory penalties or customer dissatisfaction. 
 
 All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including by cyber attacks, such as those involving ransomware. The Company discovers vulnerabilities and regularly blocks a high volume of attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems. We regularly defend against threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, system failures and disruptions. Threats have the potential to jeopardize the information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks and otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs, regulatory penalties or customer dissatisfaction. We could be similarly affected by threats against our vendors and/or third-parties with whom we share information. 
 
 Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that may hinder the Company s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. Such attacks may also increase as a result of retaliation by threat actors against actions taken by the U.S. and other countries in connection with wars and other global events. The Company operates under a hybrid workforce model and such model may be more vulnerable to security breaches. 
 
 While we have information security policies and systems in place to secure our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of sensitive information, there can be no assurance with respect to our systems and those of our third-party vendors that unauthorized access to the systems or disclosure of the sensitive information, either through the actions of third parties or employees, will not occur. Due to our reliance on information technology systems, including ours and those of our customers and third-party service providers, and to the sensitivity of the information that we maintain, unauthorized access to the systems or disclosure of the information could adversely affect our reputation, severely disrupt our operations, result in a loss of business and expose us to material claims for damages and may require that we provide free credit monitoring services to individuals affected by a security breach. 
 
 Should we experience an unauthorized disclosure of information or a cyber attack, including those involving ransomware, some of the costs we incur may not be recoverable through insurance, or legal or other processes, and this may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 For additional information about our IT systems and cybersecurity, see our risk factor titled Information technology system failures or interruptions may materially impact our operations and adversely affect our financial results" and "We could be materially adversely affected by a cyber security breach or failure of information security controls."

Explanation and reconciliation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures 
 We believe that use of the Non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted pre-tax operating income (loss), adjusted net operating income (loss) and adjusted net operating income (loss) per diluted share facilitate the evaluation of the company's core financial performance thereby providing relevant information to investors. These measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance. 
 
 Adjusted pre-tax operating income (loss) is defined as GAAP income (loss) before tax, excluding the effects of net realized investment gains (losses), gain and losses on debt extinguishment, and infrequent or unusual non-operating items where applicable. 
 
 Adjusted net operating income (loss) is defined as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the after-tax effects of net realized investment gains (losses), gain and losses on debt extinguishment and infrequent or unusual non-operating items where applicable. The amounts of adjustments to components of pre-tax operating income (loss) are tax effected using a federal statutory tax rate of 21 . 
 
 Adjusted net operating income (loss) per diluted share is calculated in a manner consistent with the accounting standard regarding earnings per share by dividing (i) adjusted net operating income (loss) after making adjustments for interest expense on convertible debt, whenever the impact is dilutive by (ii) diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, which reflects share dilution from unvested restricted stock units and from convertible debt when dilutive under the if-converted method. 
 
 Although adjusted pre-tax operating income (loss) and adjusted net operating income (loss) exclude certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items represent items that are: (1) not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities; or (2) impacted by both discretionary and other economic or regulatory factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends, or both. These adjustments, along with the reasons for their treatment, are described below. Trends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these adjustments. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by us. 
 
 (1) Net realized investment gains (losses). The recognition of net realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the timing of individual securities sales is highly discretionary and is influenced by such factors as market opportunities, our tax and capital profile, and overall market cycles. 
 (2) Gains and losses on debt extinguishment. Gains and losses on debt extinguishment result from discretionary activities that are undertaken to enhance our capital position and/or improve our debt profile. 
 (3) Infrequent or unusual non-operating items . Items that are non-recurring in nature and are not part of our primary operating activities.

Mortgage Insurance Portfolio 
 Mortgage originations 
 Our NIW is affected by the total mortgage originations, the percentage of total mortgage originations using PMI, and our market share within the PMI industry. 
 
 The total amount of mortgage originations is generally influenced by the level of home sales, interest rates, the percentage of homes purchased for cash, and the level of refinance activity. PMI market share of total mortgage originations is influenced by the mix of purchase and refinance originations. PMI market share is also impacted by the market share of total originations of the FHA, VA, USDA, and other alternatives to mortgage insurance, including GSE programs that may reduce or eliminate the demand for mortgage insurance. 
 
 NIW for the third quarter of 2024 was 17.2 billion (Q3 2023: 14.6 billion) and 39.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (YTD September 30, 2023: 35.2 billion). The increase reflects a higher expected market position in the current year compared with the same period in the prior year. For the full year, we expect our 2024 NIW to be slightly higher than 2023. 
 
 The percentage of our NIW with DTI ratios over 45 and LTVs over 95 will fluctuate based on the mortgage conditions that could include the percentage of NIW from purchase transactions, changes in home prices, changes in mortgage rates, and GSE activities. 
 
 The following tables present characteristics of our primary NIW for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 We consider a variety of loan characteristics when assessing the risk of a loan. The following table provides information about loans with one or more of the following characteristics associated with our NIW: LTV ratios greater than 95 , mortgages with borrowers having FICO scores below 680, including those with borrowers having FICO scores of 620-679, and mortgages with borrowers having DTI ratios greater than 45 , each attribute as determined at the time of loan origination.

 Insurance and risk in force 
 The amount of our IIF and RIF is impacted by the amount of NIW, cancellations, and principal payments received on our primary IIF during the period. Cancellation activity primarily results from loan payoff and refinancing activity, or borrowers achieving the required amount of home equity through loan amortization, principal curtailment and/or home price appreciation. Claim resolutions also impact cancellations but to a much lesser extent. Cancellations generally move inversely to the change in the direction of interest rates, although they generally lag a change in direction. 
 
 Annual Persistency 
 Our annual persistency was 85.3 at September 30, 2024 compared to 86.1 at December 31, 2023 and 86.3 at September 30, 2023. Since 2018, our annual persistency ranged from a high of 86.3 at September 30, 2023 to a low of 60.7 at March 31, 2021. Our persistency rate is primarily affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates on our IIF, which affects the vulnerability of the IIF to refinancing; and the current amount of equity that borrowers have in the homes underlying our IIF.

 Credit profile of our primary RIF 
 Our 2009 and later books possess significantly improved risk characteristics when compared to our 2005-2008 books. Modification and refinance programs, such as HAMP and HARP, which expired at the end of 2016 and 2018, respectively, but have been replaced by other GSE modification programs, make outstanding loans more affordable to borrowers with the goal of reducing the number of foreclosures. As of September 30, 2024, loans associated with modification programs accounted for 3.1 of our total RIF, compared to 3.6 at December 31, 2023. Loans associated with 87.7 of all our modifications were current as of September 30, 2024.

 Pool and other insurance 
 MGIC has written no new pool insurance since 2008; however, for a variety of reasons, including responding to capital market alternatives to PMI and customer demands, MGIC may write pool risk in the future. Our direct pool risk in force was 230 million 178 million on pool policies with aggregate loss limits and 52 million on pool policies without aggregate loss limits) at September 30, 2024 compared to 256 million 186 million on pool policies with aggregate loss limits and 70 million on pool policies without aggregate loss limits) at December 31, 2023. If claim payments associated with a specific pool reach the aggregate loss limit, the remaining IIF within the pool would be cancelled and any remaining delinquencies under the pool would be removed from our delinquency inventory. 
 
 In connection with the GSEs' CRT programs, an insurance subsidiary of MGIC provides insurance and reinsurance covering portions of the credit risk related to certain reference pools of mortgages acquired by the GSEs. Our RIF, as reported to us, related to these programs was approximately 393 million and 310 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Net premiums written and earned 
 Comparative quarterly and year to date results 
 Premiums earned for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 243.3 million and 729.5 million, respectively, compared with 241.3 million and 726.1 million, for the same periods last year. Net premiums written for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 234.0 million and 701.3 million, respectively, compared with 234.5 million and 695.9 million, respectively, for the same periods last year. 
 
 See Overview - Factors Affecting Our Results above for additional factors that influenced the amount of net premiums written and earned during the periods. See Reinsurance Transactions below for discussion of our ceded premiums written and earned. 
 
 Premium yields 
 Net premium yield is net premiums earned divided by average IIF during the period. The following table presents the key drivers of our net premium yield for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 Premium Yield Three Months Ended September 30,

 (1) Total direct premiums earned, excluding premium refunds and accelerated premiums from single premium policy cancellations divided by average primary insurance in force. 
 (2) In the third quarter of 2024, we updated our method for calculating the unpaid principal balance on our in force loans. This resulted in a 2.5 billion reduction in our insurance in force and a 0.2 and 0.1 basis point increase in our in force portfolio yield for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 (3) Assumed premiums include those from our participation in GSE CRT programs, of which the impact on the net premium yield was 0.5 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.4 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The following provides more detail on the key drivers of our net premium yield: 
 In force Portfolio Yield The yield on our current IIF is impacted by the premium rates on our IIF . Premium rates are generally affected by risk characteristics on our NIW, the amount of capital we are required to hold, and competition in the industry. 
 Premium Refunds Premium refunds are primarily driven by our estimate of refundable premiums on our delinquency inventory and claim activity. Our estimate of refundable premium on our delinquency inventory fluctuates with changes in our delinquency inventory and our estimate of the number of loans in our delinquency inventory that will result in a claim. Lower levels of claims received results in a lower level of premium refunds. 

MGIC Investment Corporation - Q3 2024 | 46 

Accelerated earnings on single premium policies A low level of refinance transactions reduces the benefit from accelerated earned premium from cancellation of single premium policies prior to their estimated policy life. 
 Ceded premiums earned, net of profit commission and assumed premiums Ceded premiums earned, net of profit commission adversely impact our net premium yield. Ceded premiums earned, net of profit commission, are associated with the QSR Transactions and the XOL Transactions. Assumed premiums consists primarily of premiums from GSE CRT programs. See Reinsurance Transactions below for further discussion on our reinsurance transactions. 
 As discussed in our Risk Factor titled Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and / or increase our losses, the private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive and premium rates have declined over the past several years. With the smaller origination market, higher persistency rate, and continued high credit quality for NIW expected in 2024, we expect our in force portfolio premium yield to remain relatively flat during 2024 compared to 2023. 
 
 Reinsurance Transactions 
 Quota share reinsurance 
 Our quota share reinsurance affects various lines of our statements of operations and therefore we believe it should be analyzed by reviewing its total effect on our pre-tax income, described as follows. 
 We cede a fixed percentage of premiums on insurance covered by the agreements. We receive the benefit of a profit commission through a reduction in the premiums we cede. The profit commission varies inversely with the level of losses incurred on a dollar for dollar basis and can be eliminated at loss levels higher than what we have experienced. As a result, lower levels of ceded losses incurred result in less benefit from ceded losses incurred and a higher profit commission; higher levels of ceded losses incurred result in more benefit from ceded losses incurred and a lower profit commission (or for certain levels of accident year loss ratios, its elimination). 
 We receive the benefit of a ceding commission through a reduction in underwriting expenses equal to 20 of premiums ceded (before the effect of the profit commission). We cede a fixed percentage of losses incurred on insurance covered by the agreements. 
 
 The following table provides information related to our QSR Transactions for each of the three and nine months ended and as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

 2,602 Credit Union QSR 2,771 2,557 Total ceded RIF 17,314 18,862 
 
 The decrease in profit commission for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by a decrease in the percentage of our IIF covered by the QSR Transactions as discussed below and an increase in ceded losses incurred. Ceded losses incurred are impacted by the delinquencies covered by our QSR Transactions, our estimates of payments that will be ultimately made on those delinquencies, and claim payments covered by our QSR Transactions. 
 
 We terminated our 2020 QSR Transaction effective December 31, 2023. We have elected to terminate our 2021 QSR transaction effective December 31, 2024, and we expect to incur an early termination fee in the fourth quarter of approximately 8 million. 

MGIC Investment Corporation - Q3 2024 | 47 

We have agreed upon terms of a 40 QSR transaction with a group of unaffiliated reinsurers covering most of our new insurance written in 2025 and 2026. 
 
 Covered risk 
 The percentages of our NIW, new risk written, IIF, and RIF subject to our QSR Transactions as shown in the following table will vary from period to period in part due to the mix of our risk written during the period and the number of active QSR Transactions. 
 Quota Share Reinsurance Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 NIW subject to QSR Transactions 87.0 87.2 87.1 87.1 New Risk Written subject to QSR Transactions 92.8 92.9 92.9 92.9 IIF subject to QSR Transactions 66.3 72.6 66.3 72.6 RIF subject to QSR Transactions 69.7 77.1 69.7 77.1 
 
 The decrease in IIF and RIF subject to QSR Transactions was primarily due to the termination of our 2020 QSR Transaction at December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average coverage percentage of our QSR transactions was 32 based on RIF. 
 
 Excess of loss reinsurance 
 We have XOL Transactions with panels of unaffiliated reinsurers executed through the traditional reinsurance market Traditional XOL Transaction and with unaffiliated special purpose insurers Home Re Transactions ). 
 
 For policies covered by our Traditional XOL Transactions, we retain the first layer of the aggregate losses paid, and the reinsurers will then provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. We retain losses paid in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. The reinsurance coverage is subject to adjustment based on the risk characteristics of the covered loans until the initial excess of loss reinsurance coverage layer has been finalized. 
 
 The Home Re Transactions are executed through the issuance of insurance linked notes ILNs ). As of September 30, 2024 our Home Re Transactions provided 0.9 billion of loss coverage on a portfolio of policies having an in force date from January 1, 2018 through March 31, 2019, from August 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, and from June 1, 2022 through August 31, 2023; all dates inclusive. For this reinsurance coverage, we retain the first layer of the respective aggregate losses paid, and a Home Re Entity will then provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance amount. 
 
 The current attachment, current detachment, and PMIERs required asset credit for each of our XOL Transactions, excluding the 2024 Traditional XOL which is still in its fill up period, as of September 30, 2024, are as follows.

 (2) The percentage represents the cumulative losses as a percentage of adjusted risk in force that must be reached before MGIC begins absorbing losses after the XOL layer. 
 
 In January and September 2024, we exercised our optional call feature to terminate the reinsurance agreement with Home Re 2020-1, Ltd. and Home Re 2018-1, Ltd., respectively. In connection with the termination, the insurance linked notes issued by Home Re 2020-1, Ltd. and Home Re 2018-1, Ltd. were redeemed in full. 
 
 Ceded premiums on our XOL Transactions were 16.9 million and 49.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 17.5 million and 51.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 See Note 4 - Reinsurance" to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our QSR and XOL Transactions.

Investment income 
 Comparative quarterly and year to date results 
 Net investment income in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 62.1 million and 55.4 million, respectively. Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 183.3 million and 156.9 million, respectively. The increase in net investment income was primarily due to an increase of approximately 38 and 49 basis points in the average investment yields three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 Losses incurred, net 
 As discussed in Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 10-K MD A, we establish case loss reserves for future claims on delinquent loans that were reported to us as two payments past due and have not become current or resulted in a claim payment. Such loans are referred to as being in our delinquency inventory. Case loss reserves are established based on estimating the number of loans in our delinquency inventory that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as the claim rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity. 
 
 IBNR reserves are established for estimated losses from delinquencies we estimate have occurred prior to the close of an accounting period but have not yet been reported to us. IBNR reserves are also established using estimated claim rates and claim severities. 
 
 Estimation of losses is inherently judgmental. Even in a stable environment, changes to our estimates could result in a material impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. The conditions that affect the claim rate and claim severity include the current and future state of the domestic economy, including unemployment and the current and future strength of local housing markets; exposure on insured loans; the amount of time between delinquency and claim filing (all else being equal, the longer the period between delinquency and claim filing, the greater the severity); and curtailments and rescissions. The actual amount of the claim payments may be substantially different than our loss reserve estimates. Our estimates could be adversely affected by several factors, including a deterioration of regional or national economic conditions, including unemployment, leading to a reduction in borrowers income and thus their ability to make mortgage payments, the impact of past and future government initiatives and actions taken by the GSEs (including mortgage forbearance programs and foreclosure moratoriums), and a drop in housing values which may affect borrower willingness to continue to make mortgage payments when the value of the home is below the mortgage balance. Loss reserves in future periods will also be dependent on the number of loans reported to us as delinquent. 
 
 Generally, losses follow a seasonal trend in which the first quarter of the year has stronger credit performance than the following three quarters, with higher cure rates and lower new notice activity. The state of the economy, local housing markets, pandemics, natural disasters, and various other factors may result in delinquencies not following the typical pattern. 
 
 For information on how pandemics and natural disasters could affect losses incurred, net see our Risk Factors titled Pandemics, hurricanes and other disasters may impact our incurred losses, the amount and timing of paid claims, our inventory of notices of default and our Minimum Required Assets under PMIERs". As discussed in our Risk Factor titled Because we establish loss reserves only upon a loan delinquency rather than based on estimates of our ultimate losses on risk in force, losses may have a disproportionate adverse effect on our earnings in certain periods if we have not received a notice of delinquency with respect to a loan and if we have not estimated the loan to be delinquent as of September 30, 2024 through our IBNR reserve, then we have not yet recorded an incurred loss with respect to that loan. 
 
 Our estimates are also affected by any agreements we enter into regarding our claims paying practices. 
 
 Comparative quarterly results 
 Losses incurred, net for the third quarter of 2024 were (9.8) million, a decrease of 9.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 losses incurred, net of (0.1) million. While new delinquency notices added approximately 55.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, our re-estimation of loss reserves on previously received delinquency notices resulted in favorable development of approximately 65.6 million. For three months ended September 30, 2023, new delinquency notices added approximately 48.1 million, offset by our re-estimation of loss reserves on previously received delinquency notices resulting in favorable development of approximately 48.2 million. The favorable development for both periods primarily resulted from a decrease in the expected claim rate on previously received delinquencies. Home price appreciation experienced in recent years has allowed some borrowers to cure their delinquencies through the sale of their property.

Comparative year to date results 
 Losses incurred, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were (23.6) million, a decrease of 12.3 million compared to the prior year losses incurred, net of (11.3) million. While new delinquency notices added approximately 158.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our re-estimation of loss reserves on previously received delinquency notices resulted in favorable development of approximately 181.9 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, new delinquency notices added approximately 137.6 million, offset by our re-estimation of loss reserves on previously received delinquency notices resulting in favorable development of approximately 148.9 million. The favorable development for both periods primarily resulted from a decrease in the expected claim rate on previously received delinquencies. Home price appreciation experienced in recent years has allowed some borrowers to cure their delinquencies through the sale of their property.

Claims severity 
 Factors that impact claim severity include: 
 economic conditions at time of claim filing, including home prices compared to home prices at the time of placement of coverage, exposure of the loan, which is the unpaid principal balance of the loan times our insurance coverage percentage, length of time between delinquency and claim filing (which impacts the amount of interest and expenses, with a longer time between default and claim filing generally increasing severity), and curtailments. 
 
 As discussed in Note 11 - Loss Reserves, our loss reserves estimates take into consideration trends over time, because the development of the delinquencies may vary from period to period without establishing a meaningful trend. An increase in third party property sales prior to claim settlement has resulted in a decrease in the average claim paid and the average claim paid as a percentage of exposure in recent years. We expect average claims paid as a percentage of exposure to increase as we receive 
 
 MGIC Investment Corporation - Q3 2024 | 51 

delinquencies that have not experienced the same level of home price appreciation. The extent and timing of these increases are uncertain. 
 
 The majority of loans insured prior to 2014 (which represent 32 of the loans in the delinquency inventory) are covered by master policy terms that, except under certain circumstances, do not limit the number of years that an insured can include interest when filing a claim. Under our current master policy terms, an insured can include accumulated interest when filing a claim only for the first three years the loan is delinquent. In each case, the insured must comply with its obligations under the terms of the applicable master policy.

 The table below shows the number of consecutive months a borrower is delinquent. Historically as a delinquency ages it is more likely to result in a claim.

 The length of time a loan is in the delinquency inventory can differ from the number of payments that the borrower has not made or is considered delinquent. These differences typically result from a borrower making monthly payments that do not result in the loan becoming fully current. Generally, a defaulted loan with more missed payments is more likely to result in a claim. The number of payments that a borrower is delinquent is shown in the following table.

 Net losses and LAE paid 
 Net losses and LAE paid in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were consistent with the same periods in the prior year. The primary average claim paid can vary materially from period to period based upon a variety of factors, including the local 
 
 MGIC Investment Corporation - Q3 2024 | 52 

market conditions, average loan amount, average coverage percentage, the amount of time between delinquency and claim filing, and our loss mitigation efforts on loans for which claims are paid. 
 
 The following table presents our net losses and LAE paid for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Net losses and LAE paid have been positively impacted by home price appreciation experienced in recent years that has allowed more delinquent loans to cure through the sale of the property. In addition, an increase in third party property sales prior to claim settlement has resulted in a decrease in the average claim paid on the claims we do receive. We expect net losses and LAE paid to increase, however, the magnitude and timing of the increases are uncertain.

 On our primary business, the highest claim frequency years have typically been the third and fourth year after loan origination. However, the pattern of claim frequency can be affected by many factors, including persistency and deteriorating economic conditions. Deteriorating economic conditions can result in increasing claims following a period of declining claims. As of September 30, 2024, 47 of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2021, 72 of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2020, and 87 of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2019.

Underwriting and other expenses, net 
 Underwriting and other expenses includes items such as employee compensation costs, fees for professional and consulting services, depreciation and maintenance expense, and premium taxes, and are reported net of ceding commissions. 
 
 Underwriting and other expenses, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 51.0 million and 50.1 million, respectively. Underwriting and other expenses, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 162.7 million and 174.2 million, respectively. The decrease in underwriting and other expenses, net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in pension expenses, and a decrease in expenses related to professional and consulting services. Pension expenses were higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to settlement accounting charges. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Underwriting expense ratio 22.4 22.2 23.7 25.8 
 The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the underwriting and operating expenses, net and amortization of DAC of our combined insurance operations (which excludes underwriting and operating expenses of our non-insurance subsidiaries) to net premiums written. The underwriting expense ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased compared with the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in underwriting and other expenses, net, and an increase in net premiums written.

 Investments - Our investments balance was 6.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 5.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The fair value of our investment portfolio increased due to a decrease in the prevailing market interest rates.

 Cash and cash equivalents - Our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased to 288.6 million as of September 30, 2024, from 363.7 million as of December 31, 2023, as cash used in investing and financing activities was only partially offset by net cash generated by operating activities. 
 
 Reinsurance recoverable on paid losses - Reinsurance recoverable on paid losses decreased to 1.0 million at September 30, 2024, from 9.9 million at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023 the reinsurance recoverable on paid losses was primarily composed of losses recoverable from reinsurers at the time of termination of the 2020 QSR Transaction. Generally, in a reinsurance termination, amounts for any incurred but unpaid losses are due to us from the reinsurers.

 Loss reserves and Reinsurance recoverable on loss reserves - Our loss reserves include estimates of losses and settlement expenses on (1) loans in our delinquency inventory (known as case reserves), (2) IBNR delinquencies, and (3) LAE. Our gross reserves are reduced by reinsurance recoverable on loss reserves to calculate a net reserve balance. Loss reserves decreased to 460.6 million as of September 30, 2024, from 505.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in loss reserves is primarily from favorable development on previously received delinquency notices, partially offset by loss reserves established on new notices. Reinsurance recoverables on loss reserves were 45.3 million and 33.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The reinsurance recoverable is impacted by the mix of delinquencies covered by our QSR Transactions. 
 
 Unearned premiums - Our unearned premium decreased to 129.6 million as of September 30, 2024 from 157.8 million as of December 31, 2023 primarily due to the run-off of our existing portfolio of single premium policies outpacing the level of NIW from single premium policies. 
 
 Income Taxes - Our current income tax liability was 14.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and is included as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our current income tax receivable was 10.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and is included as a component of other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Our net deferred tax asset was 56.0 million and 79.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The change in our deferred income tax asset was primarily due to the change in the fair market value of our investment portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We owned 925.2 million and 848.6 million of tax and loss bonds at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Shareholder s equity - The increase in shareholders equity primarily relates to net income, partially offset by repurchases of our common stock and dividends paid to shareholders in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Consolidated Cash Flow Analysis 
 We have three primary types of cash flows: (1) operating cash flows, which consist mainly of cash generated by our insurance operations and income earned on our investment portfolio, less amounts paid for claims, interest expense and operating expenses, (2) investing cash flows related to the purchase, sale and maturity of investments and purchases of property and equipment and (3) financing cash flows generally from activities that impact our capital structure, such as changes in debt and shares outstanding, and dividend payments. The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: 
 Summary of consolidated cash flows Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 542,654 526,716 Investing activities (122,242) (240,754) Financing activities (491,447) (343,750) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents (71,035) (57,788) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased when compared with the same period of 2023 primarily due to an increase in investment income, a decrease in other underwriting and operating expenses, net, and a decrease in losses paid, net, partially offset by an increase in net income taxes. 
 
 We also have purchase obligations totaling approximately 12.3 million which consist primarily of contracts related to our continued investment in our information technology infrastructure in the normal course of business. The majority of these obligations are under contracts that give us cancellation rights with notice. In the next twelve months we anticipate we will pay approximately 8.7 million for our purchase obligations. 
 
 Future contributions to our qualified pension plan are impacted by the net funded status (the market value of our plan assets compared to the projected benefit obligation). 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, primarily reflects purchases of fixed income securities that exceeded sales and maturities of fixed income securities during the period. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects repurchases of our common stock, dividends to shareholders, and the payment of withholding taxes related to share-based compensation net share settlement. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflects the repurchases of our common stock, dividends to shareholders, and the conversion of our 9 Debentures. 
 
 Capitalization 
 Debt - holding company 
 As of September 30, 2024, our holding company s debt obligations were 650 million in aggregate principal amount consisting of our 5.25 Notes due in 2028. See Note 7 Debt to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information about the terms of our indebtedness. 
 
 Liquidity analysis - holding company 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had approximately 841 million and 918 million, respectively, in cash and investments at our holding company. These resources are maintained primarily to service our debt interest expense, pay debt maturities, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders, and to settle intercompany obligations. While these assets are held, we generate investment income that serves to offset a portion of our cash requirements. The payment of dividends from MGIC are the principal source of holding company cash inflow and their payment is restricted by insurance regulation. See Note 14 - Statutory Information to our consolidated financial statement for additional information about MGIC s dividend restrictions. The payment of dividends from MGIC is also influenced by our view of the appropriate level of excess PMIERs Available Assets to maintain, which can change over time. Raising capital in the public markets is another potential source of holding company liquidity. The ability to raise capital in the public markets is subject to prevailing market conditions, investor demand for the securities to be issued, and our deemed creditworthiness. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 17.5 million shares of our common stock for 373.2 million. As of September 30, 2024 we had remaining authorization to repurchase 651.0 million under our existing share repurchase program. Through October 2024, we repurchased an additional 2.9 million shares totaling 72.4 million under the remaining authorization through December 31, 2026. 
 
 MGIC Investment Corporation - Q3 2024 | 58 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 97.5 million in dividends to shareholders. On October 24, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of the company s common stock of 0.13 per share to shareholders of record on November 7, 2024. 
 
 Over the next twelve months the principal demand on our holding company resources will be interest payments on our 5.25 Notes approximating 34.0 million and dividends to shareholders. We believe our holding company has sufficient sources of liquidity to meet its payment obligations for the foreseeable future. 
 
 We may also use holding company cash to repurchase additional shares, however, our repurchases are subject to variation based on a variety of factors including our capital and liquidity position and the share price of our common stock. Such repurchases may be material, may be made for cash (funded by debt) and/or exchanges for other securities, and may be made in open market purchases (including through 10b5-1 plans), privately negotiated acquisitions or other transactions. See "Overview-Capital" of this MD A for a discussion of our share repurchase programs. 
 
 Significant cash and investments inflows at our holding company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 350.0 million dividend received from MGIC, 
 34.0 million in intercompany tax receipts, 
 23.1 million of investment income. 
 Significant cash outflows at our holding company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 374.8 million of net share repurchase transactions, 
 97.5 million of cash dividends paid to shareholders, and 
 34.1 million of interest payments on our outstanding debt obligation. 
 
 The net unrealized gains on our holding company investment portfolio were approximately 5.2 million at September 30, 2024, and the portfolio had an effective duration of approximately 0.9 years. 
 
 MGIC paid 350 million in dividends to our holding company in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Future dividend payments from MGIC to the holding company will be determined in consultation with the board, and after considering any updated estimates about our business. We ask the Wisconsin OCI not to object before MGIC pays dividends to the holding company. In October 2024, MGIC paid a 400 million dividend to our holding company. 
 
 Debt at subsidiaries 
 MGIC did not have any outstanding debt obligations at September 30, 2024. MGIC is a member of the FHLB, which provides MGIC access to an additional source of liquidity via a secured lending facility. We may borrow from the FHLB at any time. 
 
 Capital Adequacy 
 PMIERs 
 As of September 30, 2024, MGIC s Available Assets under the PMIERs totaled approximately 6.0 billion, an excess of approximately 2.5 billion over its Minimum Required Assets; and MGIC is in compliance with the requirements of the PMIERs and eligible to insure loans delivered to or purchased by the GSEs. Our reinsurance transactions provided an aggregate of approximately 2.2 billion of capital credit under the PMIERs as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 4 - Reinsurance to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our reinsurance transactions. 
 
 The table below presents the PMIERS capital credit for our reinsurance transactions. 
 
 PMIERs - Reinsurance Credit (In millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 QSR Transactions 1,174 1,081 Home Re Transactions 725 921 Traditional XOL Transactions 348 230 Total capital credit for Reinsurance Transactions 2,247 2,232 
 
 The PMIERs generally require us to hold significantly more Minimum Required Assets for delinquent loans than for performing loans and the Minimum Required Assets required to be held increases as the number of payments missed on a delinquent loan increases. Refer to Overview - Capital - GSEs of this MD A and our risk factor titled We may not continue to meet the GSEs private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease if we are required to maintain more capital in order to maintain our eligibility for further discussion of PMIERs.

Risk-to-capital 
 We compute our risk-to-capital ratio on a separate company statutory basis, as well as on a combined insurance operations basis. The risk-to-capital ratio is our net RIF divided by our policyholders position. Our net RIF includes both primary and pool risk in force, net of reinsurance and excludes risk on policies that are currently in default and for which case loss reserves have been established and the risk covered by reinsurance. The risk amount includes pools of loans with contractual aggregate loss limits and without these limits. MGIC s policyholders position consists primarily of statutory policyholders surplus (which generally changes due to statutory net income/loss and dividends paid, among other things), plus the statutory contingency loss reserve. The statutory contingency loss reserve is reported as a liability on the statutory balance sheet. A mortgage insurance company is required to make annual additions to a contingency loss reserve of approximately 50 of earned premiums. These contributions must generally be maintained for a period of ten years. However, with regulatory approval a mortgage insurance company may make early withdrawals from the contingency loss reserve when incurred losses exceed 35 of earned premiums in a calendar year. 
 
 The table below presents our risk-to-capital calculation: 
 Risk-to-capital - MGIC (In millions, except ratio) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 RIF - net (1) 
 58,209 58,832 Statutory policyholders surplus 651 636 Statutory contingency loss reserve 5,401 5,131 Statutory policyholders position 6,052 5,767 Risk-to-capital 9.6:1

 For additional information regarding regulatory capital see Note 14 Statutory Information to our consolidated financial statements as well as our Risk Factor titled State Capital requirements may prevent us from continuing to write new insurance on an uninterrupted basis.

Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors 
 General : Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be affected by the Risk Factors referred to under Location of Risk Factors below. These Risk Factors are an integral part of Management s Discussion and Analysis. 
 
 These factors may also cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by forward looking statements that we may make. Forward looking statements consist of statements which relate to matters other than historical fact. Among others, statements that include words such as we believe, anticipate or expect, or words of similar import, are forward looking statements. These Risk Factors speak only as of the date of this filing and are subject to change without notice as the Company cannot predict all risks relating to this evolving set of events. We are not undertaking any obligation to update any forward looking statements we may make even though these statements may be affected by events or circumstances occurring after the forward looking statements were made. Therefore, no reader of this document should rely on these statements being current as of any time other than the time at which this document was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 While we communicate with security analysts from time to time, it is against our policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential information. Accordingly, investors should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report, and such reports are not our responsibility. 
 
 Location of Risk Factors: The Risk Factors are in Item 1 A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by Part II, Item 1 A of our quarterly report on form 10Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024 and Part II, Item 1 A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Risk Factors in the 10-K, as supplemented by this 10 Q and through updating of various statistical and other information, are reproduced in Exhibit 99 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Our investment portfolio is essentially a fixed income portfolio and is exposed to market risk. Important drivers of the market risk are credit spread risk and interest rate risk. 
 
 Credit spread risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in credit spreads. Credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities above the risk-free rate (typically referenced as the yield on U.S. Treasury securities) that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit, liquidity and/or prepayment risks. 
 
 We manage credit risk via our investment policy guidelines which primarily place our investments in investment grade securities and limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. Guideline and investment portfolio detail is available in "Business Section E, Investment Portfolio" in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the characteristics of our interest bearing assets. 
 
 One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is effective duration. Effective duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets to the changes in spreads. At September 30, 2024, the effective duration of our fixed income investment portfolio was 3.8 years, which means that an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in a change of 3.8 in the fair value of our fixed income portfolio. For an upward shift in the yield curve, the fair value of our portfolio would decrease and for a downward shift in the yield curve, the fair value would increase. See Note 7 Investments to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure surrounding our investment portfolio. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of such period. 
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we implemented enhancements to our financial management system. During this implementation we have taken steps to implement and maintain appropriate and effective internal control over financial reporting and will continue to evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in subsequent periods. 
 
 Other than the aforementioned implementation of enhancements to our financial management system, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business may be filed or pending against us from time to time. For information about such legal proceedings, you should review Note 5 - Litigation and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements and our Risk Factor titled We are subject to the risk of legal proceedings in Exhibit 99. 

Item 1 A. Risk Factors 
 With the exception of the changes described and set forth below, there have been no material changes in our Risk Factors from the risk factors disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The risk factors in the 10-K, as supplemented by this 10-Q and through updating of various statistical and other information, are reproduced in their entirety in Exhibit 99 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. 
 Risk Factors Relating to Our Business Generally 
 The inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations, pay future shareholder dividends and/or make future share repurchases. 
 MGIC Investment Corporation is the holding company for our insurance operating subsidiaries. At the holding company level, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries and cash and investments. Dividends and other permitted distributions from MGIC are the holding company's primary source of funds used to meet ongoing cash requirements, including future debt service payments, repurchases of its shares, payment of dividends to our shareholders, and other expenses. Other sources of holding company cash inflow include investment income and raising capital in the public markets. The payment of dividends from MGIC is subject to regulatory approval as described in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and may not be paid if disapproved by the OCI. The prescribed limits are based on a rolling 12-month period, and as such, the impact of the limitations will vary over time. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, MGIC paid 650 million in dividends to the holding company. Future dividend payments from MGIC to the holding company will be determined in consultation with the board of directors, and after considering any updated estimates about our business, subject to regulatory approval. 
 The long-term debt obligations are owed by the holding company and not its subsidiaries. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 841 million in cash and investments at our holding company and our holding company s long-term debt obligations were 650 million in aggregate principal amount. Annual debt service on the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2024, is approximately 34 million. The inability of MGIC to pay dividends (or other intercompany amounts due) in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have an adverse effect on our operations, and our ability to repay debt, repurchase shares and/or pay dividends to shareholders. 
 
 If any capital contributions to our subsidiaries are required, such contributions would decrease our holding company cash and investments. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 The following table provides information about purchases of MGIC Investment Corporation common stock by us during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market (including through 10b5-1 plans) or through privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time.

 Risk Factors 
 
 Risk Factors included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024, and through updating of various statistical and other information. 
 
 As used below, we, our and us refer to MGIC Investment Corporation s consolidated operations or to MGIC Investment Corporation, as the context requires and MGIC refers to Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation. 

Risk Factors Relating to Global Events 
 Wars and or other global events may adversely affect the U.S. economy and our business. 
 Wars and or other global events may result in increased inflation rates, strained supply chains, and increased volatility in the domestic and global financial markets. Wars and or other global events have in the past and may continue to impact our business in various ways, including the following which are described in more detail in the remainder of these risk factors 
 The terms under which we are able to obtain quota share reinsurance QSR and or excess-of-loss XOL reinsurance through the insurance-linked notes ILN market and the traditional reinsurance market may be negatively impacted and terms under which we are able to access those markets in the future may be limited or less attractive. 
 The risk of a cybersecurity incident that affects our company may increase. 
 Wars may negatively impact the domestic economy, which may increase unemployment and inflation, or decrease home prices, in each case leading to an increase in loan delinquencies. 
 The volatility in the financial markets may impact the performance of our investment portfolio and our investment portfolio may include investments in companies or securities that are negatively impacted by wars and or other global events. 
 
 Risk Factors Relating to the Mortgage Insurance Industry and its Regulation 
 Downturns in the domestic economy or declines in home prices may result in more homeowners defaulting and our losses increasing, with a corresponding decrease in our returns. 
 Losses result from events that reduce a borrower s ability or willingness to make mortgage payments, such as unemployment, health issues, changes in family status, and decreases in home prices that result in the borrower's mortgage balance exceeding the net value of the home. A deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in unemployment, generally increases the likelihood that borrowers will not have sufficient income to pay their mortgages and can also adversely affect home prices. 
 High levels of unemployment may result in an increasing number of loan delinquencies and an increasing number of insurance claims however, unemployment is difficult to predict as it may be impacted by a number of factors, including the health of the economy, and wars and other global events. 
 The seasonally-adjusted Purchase-Only U.S. Home Price Index of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the FHFA ), which is based on single-family properties whose mortgages have been purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, indicates that home prices increased .3 nationwide in August, 2024 compared to July, 2024. Although the 12 month change in home prices recently reached historically high rates, the rate of growth is moderating it increased by 2.3 in the first 8 months of 2024, after increasing 6.7 , 6.8 , and 17.8 in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The national average price-to-income ratio exceeds its historical average, in part as a result of recent home price appreciation outpacing increases in income. Affordability issues can put downward pressure on home prices. A decline in home prices may occur even absent a deterioration in economic conditions due to declines in demand for homes, which in turn may result from changes in buyers perceptions of the potential for future appreciation, restrictions on and the cost of mortgage credit due to more stringent underwriting standards, higher interest rates, changes to the tax deductibility of mortgage interest, decreases in the rate of household formations, or other factors. 
 
 Changes in the business practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the GSEs ), federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses. 
 The substantial majority of our new insurance written NIW is for loans purchased by the GSEs therefore, the business practices of the GSEs greatly impact our business. In 2022 the GSEs each published Equitable Housing Finance Plans Plans ). Updated Plans were published by the GSEs in the spring of 2024. The Plans seek to advance equity in housing finance over a three-year period and include potential changes to the GSEs business practices and 

policies. Specifically relating to mortgage insurance, (1) Fannie Mae s Plan includes the creation of special purpose credit program(s) SPCPs targeted to historically underserved borrowers and the support of locally-controlled SPCPs with a goal of lowering costs for such borrowers through lower than standard mortgage insurance requirements and (2) Freddie Mac s Plan includes plans to work with mortgage insurers to look for ways to lower mortgage costs, the creation of SPCPs targeted to historically underserved borrowers, and the planned purchase of loans originated through lender-created SPCPs. To the extent the business practices and policies of the GSEs regarding mortgage insurance coverage, costs and cancellation change, including more broadly than through SPCPs, such changes may negatively impact the mortgage insurance industry and our financial results. 
 
 Other business practices of the GSEs that affect the mortgage insurance industry include 
 The GSEs' private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements PMIERs ), the financial requirements of which are discussed in our risk factor titled We may not continue to meet the GSEs private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease if we are required to maintain more capital in order to maintain our eligibility. 
 The capital and collateral requirements for participants in the GSEs' alternative forms of credit enhancement discussed in our risk factor titled The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance or are unable to obtain capital relief for mortgage insurance. 
 The level of private mortgage insurance coverage, subject to the limitations of the GSEs charters, when private mortgage insurance is used as the required credit enhancement on low down payment mortgages (the GSEs generally require a level of mortgage insurance coverage that is higher than the level of coverage required by their charters any change in the required level of coverage will impact our new risk written). 
 The amount of loan level price adjustments and guaranty fees (which result in higher costs to borrowers) that the GSEs assess on loans that require private mortgage insurance. The requirements of the new GSE capital framework may lead the GSEs to increase their guaranty fees. In addition, the FHFA has indicated that it is reviewing the GSEs' pricing in connection with preparing them to exit conservatorship and to ensure that pricing subsidies benefit only affordable housing activities. 
 Whether the GSEs select or influence the mortgage lender s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage. 
 The underwriting standards that determine which loans are eligible for purchase by the GSEs, which can affect the quality of the risk insured by the mortgage insurer and the availability of mortgage loans. 
 The terms on which mortgage insurance coverage can be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law and the business practices associated with such cancellations. If the GSEs or other mortgage investors change their practices regarding the timing of cancellation of mortgage insurance due to home price appreciation, policy goals, changing risk tolerances or otherwise, we could experience an unexpected reduction in our insurance in force IIF ), which would negatively impact our business and financial results. For more information, see the above discussion of the GSEs' Equitable Housing Plans and our risk factor titled Changes in interest rates, house prices or mortgage insurance cancellation requirements may change the length of time that our policies remain in force . 
 The programs established by the GSEs intended to avoid or mitigate loss on insured mortgages and the circumstances in which mortgage servicers must implement such programs. 
 The terms that the GSEs require to be included in mortgage insurance policies for loans that they purchase, including limitations on the rescission rights of mortgage insurers. 
 The extent to which the GSEs intervene in mortgage insurers claims paying practices, rescission practices or rescission settlement practices with lenders. 
 The maximum loan limits of the GSEs compared to those of the Federal Housing Administration FHA and other investors. 
 The benchmarks established by the FHFA for loans to be purchased by the GSEs, which can affect the loans available to be insured. In December 2021, the FHFA established the benchmark levels for 2022-2024 purchases of low-income home mortgages, very low-income home mortgages and low-income refinance mortgages, each of which exceeded the 2021 benchmarks. The FHFA also established two new sub-goals one targeting minority communities and the other targeting low-income neighborhoods. In August 2024, FHFA proposed new benchmark levels for 2025-2027 purchases of low-income home mortgages, very low-income home mortgages and low-income refinance mortgages. The newly-proposed levels for low-income and very low-income mortgages are lower than the 2022-2024 levels, but are higher than pre-2022 levels. The newly-proposed level for low income refinance mortgages is unchanged from the 2022-2024 level, but is higher than the pre-2022 level. 

The FHFA has been the conservator of the GSEs since 2008 and has the authority to control and direct their operations. Given that the Director of the FHFA is removable by the President at will, the agency's agenda, policies and actions are influenced by the then-current administration. The increased role that the federal government has assumed in the residential housing finance system through the GSE conservatorships may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the GSEs change, including through administration changes and actions. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on us. The GSEs also possess substantial market power, which enables them to influence our business and the mortgage insurance industry in general. 
 It is uncertain what role the GSEs, FHA and private capital, including private mortgage insurance, will play in the residential housing finance system in the future. The timing and impact on our business of any resulting changes are uncertain. For changes that would require Congressional action to implement it is difficult to estimate when Congressional action would be final and how long any associated phase-in period may last. 
 
 We may not continue to meet the GSEs private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease if we are required to maintain more capital in order to maintain our eligibility. 
 We must comply with a GSE's PMIERs to be eligible to insure loans delivered to or purchased by that GSE. The PMIERs include financial requirements, as well as business, quality control and certain transaction approval requirements. The PMIERs provide that the GSEs may amend any provision of the PMIERs or impose additional requirements with an effective date specified by the GSEs. 
 The financial requirements of the PMIERs require a mortgage insurer s Available Assets (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) to equal or exceed its Minimum Required Assets (which are generally based on an insurer s book of risk in force and calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions, reduced for credit given for risk ceded under reinsurance agreements). 
 Based on our interpretation of the PMIERs, as of September 30, 2024, MGIC s Available Assets totaled 6.0 billion, or 2.5 billion in excess of its Minimum Required Assets. MGIC is in compliance with the PMIERs and eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. In August 2024, the GSEs issued updates to the calculation of Available Assets. The update will be implemented through a 24-month phased-in approach, with a fully effective date of September 30, 2026. If these changes were effective as of September 30, 2024, without a graduated implementation period, MGIC's Available Assets of 6.0 billion would decrease by approximately 1 or 50 million, and MGIC's PMIERs excess would be 2.5 billion. 
 Our Minimum Required Assets reflect a credit for risk ceded under our QSR and XOL reinsurance transactions, which are discussed in our risk factor titled Our underwriting practices and the mix of business we write affects our Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs, our premium yields and the likelihood of losses occurring. The calculated credit for XOL reinsurance transactions under PMIERs is generally based on the PMIERs requirement of the covered loans and the attachment and detachment points of the coverage, all of which fluctuate over time. PMIERs credit is generally not given for the reinsured risk above the PMIERs requirement. The GSEs have discretion to further limit reinsurance credit under the PMIERs. Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations Reinsurance Transactions in Part I, Item 2 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information about the calculated PMIERs credit for our XOL transactions. There is a risk we will not receive our current level of credit in future periods for ceded risk. In addition, we may not receive the same level of credit under future reinsurance transactions that we receive under existing transactions. If MGIC is not allowed certain levels of credit under the PMIERs, under certain circumstances, MGIC may terminate the reinsurance transactions without penalty. 
 The PMIERs generally require us to hold significantly more Minimum Required Assets for delinquent loans than for performing loans and the Minimum Required Assets required to be held increases as the number of payments missed on a delinquent loan increases. If the number of loan delinquencies increases for reasons discussed in these risk factors, or otherwise, it may cause our Minimum Required Assets to exceed our Available Assets. We are unable to predict the ultimate number of loans that will become delinquent. 
 If our Available Assets fall below our Minimum Required Assets, we would not be in compliance with the PMIERs. The PMIERs provide a list of remediation actions for a mortgage insurer's non-compliance, with additional actions possible in the GSEs' discretion. At the extreme, the GSEs may suspend or terminate our eligibility to insure loans purchased by them. Such suspension or termination would significantly reduce the volume of our NIW, the substantial majority of which is for loans delivered to or purchased by the GSEs. 
 Should capital be needed by MGIC in the future, capital contributions from our holding company may not be available due to competing demands on holding company resources. 
 
 Because loss reserve estimates are subject to uncertainties, paid claims may be substantially different than our loss reserves. 
 When we establish case reserves, we estimate our ultimate loss on delinquent loans by estimating the number of such loans that will result in a claim payment (the claim rate ), and further estimating the amount of the claim payment (the claim severity ). Changes to our claim rate and claim severity estimates could have a material impact 

on our future results, even in a stable economic environment. Our estimates incorporate anticipated cures, loss mitigation activity, rescissions and curtailments. The establishment of loss reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. Our actual claim payments may differ substantially from our loss reserve estimates. Our estimates could be affected by several factors, including a change in regional or national economic conditions as discussed in these risk factors and a change in the length of time loans are delinquent before claims are received. Generally, the longer a loan is delinquent before a claim is received, the greater the severity. Foreclosure moratoriums and forbearance programs increase the average time it takes to receive claims. Economic conditions may differ from region to region. Information about the geographic dispersion of our risk in force and delinquency inventory can be found in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Losses incurred generally follow a seasonal trend in which the second half of the year has weaker credit performance than the first half, with higher new default notice activity and a lower cure rate. The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent governmental response temporarily disrupted that seasonality but it appears to be returning. 
 
 We are subject to comprehensive regulation and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy. 
 We are subject to comprehensive regulation, including by state insurance departments. Many regulations are designed for the protection of our insured policyholders and consumers, rather than for the benefit of investors. Mortgage insurers, including MGIC, have in the past been involved in litigation and regulatory actions related to alleged violations of the anti-referral fee provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act RESPA ), and the notice provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA ). While these proceedings in the aggregate did not result in material liability for MGIC, there can be no assurance that the outcome of future proceedings, if any, under these laws or others would not have a material adverse effect on us. 
 We provide contract underwriting services, including on loans for which we are not providing mortgage insurance. These services are subject to federal and state regulation. Our failure to meet the standards set forth in the applicable regulations would subject us to potential regulatory action. To the extent that we are construed to make independent credit decisions in connection with our contract underwriting activities, we also could be subject to increased regulatory requirements under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA ), FCRA, and other laws. Under relevant laws, examination may also be made of whether a mortgage insurer's underwriting decisions have a disparate impact on persons belonging to a protected class in violation of the law. 
 Although their scope varies, state insurance laws generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including payment for the referral of insurance business, premium rates and discrimination in pricing, and minimum capital requirements. The increased use, by the private mortgage insurance industry, of risk-based pricing systems that establish premium rates based on more attributes than previously considered, and of algorithms, artificial intelligence and data and analytics, has led to additional regulatory scrutiny of premium rates and of other matters such as discrimination in pricing and underwriting, data privacy and access to insurance. For more information about state capital requirements, see our risk factor titled State capital requirements may prevent us from continuing to write new insurance on an uninterrupted basis . For information about regulation of data privacy, see our risk factor titled We could be materially adversely affected by a cybersecurity breach or failure of information security controls . For more details about the various ways in which our subsidiaries are regulated, see Business - Regulation in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 While we have established policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, many such laws and regulations are complex and it is not possible to predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of any reviews or investigations nor is it possible to predict their effect on us or the mortgage insurance industry. 

Pandemics, hurricanes and other disasters may impact our incurred losses, the amount and timing of paid claims, our inventory of notices of default and our Minimum Required Assets under PMIERs. 
 Pandemics and other disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires and floods, or other events related to climate change, could trigger an economic downturn in the affected areas, or in areas with similar risks, which could result in a decrease in home prices and an increased claim rate and claim severity in those areas. Due to the increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, some homeowners' insurers are increasing premium rates or withdrawing from certain states or areas that they deem to be high risk. Even though we do not generally insure losses related to property damage, the inability of a borrower to obtain hazard and or flood insurance, or the increased cost of such insurance, could lead to a decrease in home prices in the affected areas and an increase in delinquencies and our incurred losses. 
 Pandemics and other disasters could also lead to increased reinsurance rates or reduced availability of reinsurance. This may cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain and could negatively affect our compliance with the financial requirements of State Capital Requirements and the PMIERs. 
 The PMIERs require us to maintain significantly more Minimum Required Assets for delinquent loans than for performing loans. See our risk factor titled We may not continue to meet the GSEs private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease if we are required to maintain more capital in order to maintain our eligibility. 

FHFA is working to incorporate climate risk considerations into its policy development and processes. The FHFA has also instructed the GSEs to designate climate change as a priority concern and actively consider its effects in their decision making. FHFA has established internal working groups and a steering committee in order to ensure that the GSEs are accounting for the risks associated with climate change and natural disasters. In May 2024, FHFA published an advisory bulletin highlighting the need for the GSEs to establish, as appropriate, risk management practices that identify, assess, control, monitor and report climate-related risks, and the need to have appropriate risk management policies, standards, procedures, controls and reporting systems in place. It is possible that efforts to manage these risks by the FHFA, GSEs (including through GSE guideline or mortgage insurance policy changes) or others could materially impact the volume and characteristics of our NIW (including its policy terms), home prices in certain areas and defaults by borrowers in certain areas. 
 
 Reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, and or the GSEs may reduce the amount of capital credit we receive for our reinsurance transactions. 
 We have in place QSR and XOL reinsurance transactions providing various amounts of coverage on our risk in force as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Part 1, Note 4 Reinsurance and Part 1, Item 2 Consolidated Results of Operations Reinsurance Transactions of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for more information about coverage under our reinsurance transactions. The reinsurance transactions reduce the tail-risk associated with stress scenarios. As a result, they reduce the risk-based capital that we are required to hold to support the risk and they allow us to earn higher returns on risk-based capital for our business than we would without them. However, market conditions impact the availability and cost of reinsurance. Reinsurance may not always be available to us, or available only on terms or at costs that we consider unacceptable. If we are not able to obtain reinsurance we will be required to hold additional capital to support our risk in force. 
 
 Reinsurance transactions subject us to counterparty risk, including the financial capability of the reinsurers to make payments for losses ceded to them under the reinsurance agreements. As reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligation to pay claims to our policyholders, our inability to recover losses from a reinsurer could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The GSEs may change the credit they allow under the PMIERs for risk ceded under our reinsurance transactions. If the GSEs were to reduce the credit that we receive for reinsurance under the PMIERs, it could result in decreased returns absent an increase in our premium rates. An increase in our premium rates to adjust for a decrease in reinsurance credit may lead to a decrease in our NIW and net income. 

Because we establish loss reserves only upon a loan delinquency rather than based on estimates of our ultimate losses on risk in force, losses may have a disproportionate adverse effect on our earnings in certain periods. 
 In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we establish case reserves for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses only when delinquency notices are received for insured loans that are two or more payments past due and for loans we estimate are delinquent but for which delinquency notices have not yet been received (which we include in IBNR ). Losses that may occur from loans that are not delinquent are not reflected in our financial statements, except when a premium deficiency is recorded. A premium deficiency would be recorded if the present value of expected future losses and expenses exceeds the present value of expected future premiums and already established loss reserves on the applicable loans. As a result, future losses incurred on loans that are not currently delinquent may have a material impact on future results as delinquencies emerge. As of September 30, 2024, we had established case reserves and reported losses incurred for 25,089 loans in our delinquency inventory and our IBNR reserve totaled 23 million. The number of loans in our delinquency inventory may increase from that level as a result of economic conditions relating to current global events or other factors and our losses incurred may increase. 
 
 State capital requirements may prevent us from continuing to write new insurance on an uninterrupted basis. 
 The insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, MGIC's domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its risk in force (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. We refer to these requirements as the State Capital Requirements. While they vary among jurisdictions, the most common State Capital Requirements allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25 to 1. A risk-to-capital ratio will increase if (i) the percentage decrease in capital exceeds the percentage decrease in insured risk, or (ii) the percentage increase in capital is less than the percentage increase in insured risk. Wisconsin does not regulate capital by using a risk-to-capital measure but instead requires a minimum policyholder position MPP ). MGIC's policyholder position includes its net worth, or surplus, and its contingency reserve. 
 At September 30, 2024, MGIC s risk-to-capital ratio was 9.6 to 1, below the maximum allowed by the jurisdictions with State Capital Requirements, and its policyholder position was 3.9 billion above the required MPP of 2.2 billion. Our risk-to-capital ratio and MPP reflect credit for the risk ceded under our reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurers . If MGIC is not allowed an agreed level of credit under the State Capital Requirements, MGIC may terminate the reinsurance transactions, without penalty. 

In 2023, the NAIC adopted a revised Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. The updated Model Act includes requirements relating to, among other things (i) capital and minimum capital requirements, and contingency reserves (ii) restrictions on mortgage insurers investments in notes secured by mortgages (iii) prudent underwriting standards and formal underwriting guidelines (iv) the establishment of formal, internal Mortgage Guaranty Quality Control Programs with respect to in-force business and (v) reinsurance and prohibitions on captive reinsurance arrangements. It is uncertain when the revised Model Act will be adopted in any jurisdiction. The provisions of the Model Act, if adopted in their final form, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. It is unknown whether any changes will be made by state legislatures prior to adoption, and the effect changes, if any, will have on the mortgage guaranty insurance market generally, or on our business. Wisconsin, where MGIC is domiciled, has begun the process to replace current MI regulations with the Model Act, though it is expected that some changes will be made before formal adoption. 
 While MGIC currently meets the State Capital Requirements of Wisconsin and all other jurisdictions, it could be prevented from writing new business in the future in all jurisdictions if it fails to meet the State Capital Requirements of Wisconsin, or it could be prevented from writing new business in a particular jurisdiction if it fails to meet the State Capital Requirements of that jurisdiction, and in each case if MGIC does not obtain a waiver of such requirements. It is possible that regulatory action by one or more jurisdictions, including those that do not have specific State Capital Requirements, may prevent MGIC from continuing to write new insurance in such jurisdictions. If we are unable to write business in a particular jurisdiction, lenders may be unwilling to procure insurance from us anywhere. In addition, a lender s assessment of the future ability of our insurance operations to meet the State Capital Requirements or the PMIERs may affect its willingness to procure insurance from us. In this regard, see our risk factor titled Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and or increase our losses. A possible future failure by MGIC to meet the State Capital Requirements or the PMIERs will not necessarily mean that MGIC lacks sufficient resources to pay claims on its insurance liabilities. You should read the rest of these risk factors for information about matters that could negatively affect MGIC s compliance with State Capital Requirements and its claims paying resources. 
 
 If the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations declines, the amount of insurance that we write could decline. 
 The factors that may affect the volume of low down payment mortgage originations include the health of the U.S. economy conditions in regional and local economies and the level of consumer confidence the health and stability of the financial services industry restrictions on mortgage credit due to more stringent underwriting standards, liquidity issues or risk-retention and or capital requirements affecting lenders the level of home mortgage interest rates housing affordability new and existing housing availability the rate of household formation, which is influenced, in part, by population and immigration trends homeownership rates the rate of home price appreciation, which in times of heavy refinancing can affect whether refinanced loans have LTV ratios that require private mortgage insurance and government housing policy encouraging loans to first-time homebuyers. A decline in the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations could decrease demand for mortgage insurance and limit our NIW. For other factors that could decrease the demand for mortgage insurance, see our risk factor titled The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance or are unable to obtain capital relief for mortgage insurance. 
 
 The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance or are unable to obtain capital relief for mortgage insurance. 
 Alternatives to private mortgage insurance include 
 investors using risk mitigation and credit risk transfer techniques other than private mortgage insurance, or accepting credit risk without credit enhancement, 
 lenders and other investors holding mortgages in portfolio and self-insuring, 
 lenders using FHA, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VA and other government mortgage insurance programs, and 
 lenders originating mortgages using piggyback structures to avoid private mortgage insurance, such as a first mortgage with an 80 loan-to-value LTV ratio and a second mortgage with a 10 , 15 or 20 LTV ratio rather than a first mortgage with a 90 , 95 or 100 LTV ratio that has private mortgage insurance. 
 The GSEs charters generally require credit enhancement for a low down payment mortgage loan (a loan in an amount that exceeds 80 of a home s value) in order for such loan to be eligible for purchase by the GSEs. Private mortgage insurance generally has been purchased by lenders in primary mortgage market transactions to satisfy this credit enhancement requirement. In 2018, the GSEs initiated secondary mortgage market programs with loan level mortgage default coverage provided by various (re)insurers that are not mortgage insurers governed by PMIERs, and that are not selected by the lenders. These programs, which currently account for a small percentage of the low down payment market, compete with traditional private mortgage insurance and, due to differences in policy terms, they may offer premium rates that are below prevalent single premium lender-paid mortgage insurance LPMI rates. We 

participate in these programs from time to time. See our risk factor titled Changes in the business practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the GSEs ), federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses for a discussion of various business practices of the GSEs that may be changed, including through expansion or modification of these programs. 
 The GSEs (and other investors) have also used other forms of credit enhancement that did not involve traditional private mortgage insurance, such as engaging in credit-linked note transactions executed in the capital markets, or using other forms of debt issuances or securitizations that transfer credit risk directly to other investors, including competitors and an affiliate of MGIC using other risk mitigation techniques in conjunction with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage or accepting credit risk without credit enhancement. 
 If the FHA or other government-supported mortgage insurance programs increase their share of the mortgage insurance market, our business could be affected. The FHA's share of the low down payment residential mortgages that were subject to FHA, VA, USDA or primary private mortgage insurance was 33.2 in 2023, 26.7 in 2022, and 24.7 in 2021. Since 2012, the FHA s market share has been as low as 23.4 (2020) and as high as 42.1 (in 2012). Factors that influence the FHA s market share include relative rates and fees, underwriting guidelines and loan limits of the FHA, VA, private mortgage insurers and the GSEs changes to the GSEs' business practices lenders' perceptions of legal risks under FHA versus GSE programs flexibility for the FHA to establish new products as a result of federal legislation and programs returns expected to be obtained by lenders for Ginnie Mae securitization of FHA-insured loans compared to those obtained from selling loans to the GSEs for securitization and differences in policy terms, such as the ability of a borrower to cancel insurance coverage under certain circumstances. In February, 2023 the FHA announced a 30-basis point decrease in its mortgage insurance premium rates. This rate reduction has negatively impacted our NIW. The extent of the future impact of this rate reduction, or that of any other future government-supported mortgage insurance program premium changes, on our NIW is uncertain. 
 The VA's share of the low down payment residential mortgages that were subject to FHA, VA, USDA or primary private mortgage insurance was 21.5 in 2023, 24.5 in 2022, and 30.2 in 2021. Since 2012, the VA's market share has been as high as 30.9 (in 2020). The VA's 2023 market share was the lowest since 2013 (22.8 ). We believe that the VA s market share grows as the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA s program increases, and when eligible borrowers opt to use the VA program when refinancing their mortgages. The VA program offers 100 LTV ratio loans and charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount. 
 In July 2023, the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency proposed a revised regulatory capital rule that would impose higher capital standards on large U.S. banks. Under the proposed regulation's new expanded risk-based approach, affected banks would no longer receive risk-based capital relief for mortgage insurance on loans held in their portfolios. If adopted as proposed, the regulation is expected to have a negative effect on our NIW however, at this time it is difficult to predict the extent of the impact. In September 2024, it was announced that regulators may revise the proposed rule, including by lowering the proposed-risk weighting for loans secured by residential real estate. It is unknown at this time what, if any, effect this would have on our NIW. 
 
 Changes in interest rates, house prices or mortgage insurance cancellation requirements may change the length of time that our policies remain in force. 
 The premium from a single premium policy is collected upfront and generally earned over the estimated life of the policy. In contrast, premiums from monthly and annual premium policies are received each month or year, as applicable, and earned each month over the life of the policy. In each year, most of our premiums earned are from insurance that has been written in prior years. As a result, the length of time insurance remains in force, which is generally measured by persistency (the percentage of our insurance remaining in force from one year prior), is a significant determinant of our revenues. A higher than expected persistency rate may decrease the profitability from single premium policies because they will remain in force longer and may increase the incidence of claims that was estimated when the policies were written. A low persistency rate on monthly and annual premium policies will reduce future premiums but may also reduce the incidence of claims, while a high persistency on those policies will increase future premiums but may increase the incidence of claims. 
 Our annual persistency rate was 85.3 at September 30, 2024, 86.1 at December 31, 2023, and 82.2 at December 31, 2022. Since 2018, our annual persistency rate ranged from a high of 86.3 at September 30, 2023, to a low of 60.7 at March 31, 2021. Our persistency rate is primarily affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates on our insurance in force, which affects the vulnerability of the IIF to refinancing and the current amount of equity that borrowers have in the homes underlying our insurance in force. The amount of equity affects persistency in the following ways 
 Borrowers with significant equity may be able to refinance their loans without requiring mortgage insurance. 
 The Homeowners Protection Act HOPA requires servicers to cancel mortgage insurance when a borrower s LTV ratio meets or is scheduled to meet certain levels, generally based on the original value of the home and subject to various conditions and exclusions. 

The GSEs mortgage insurance cancellation guidelines apply more broadly than HOPA and also consider a home s current value. For more information about the GSEs' guidelines and business practices, and how they may change, see our risk factor titled Changes in the business practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the GSEs , federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses. 
 
 We are susceptible to disruptions in the servicing of mortgage loans that we insure and we rely on third-party reporting for information regarding the mortgage loans we insure. 
 We depend on reliable, consistent third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. An increase in delinquent loans may result in liquidity issues for servicers. When a mortgage loan that is collateral for a mortgage-backed security MBS becomes delinquent, the servicer is usually required to continue to pay principal and interest to the MBS investors, generally for four months, even though the servicer is not receiving payments from borrowers. This may cause liquidity issues, especially for non-bank servicers (who service approximately 51 of the loans underlying our IIF as of September 30, 2024) because they do not have the same sources of liquidity that bank servicers have. 
 While there has been no disruption in our premium receipts through the third quarter of 2024, servicers who experience future liquidity issues may be less likely to advance premiums to us on policies covering delinquent loans or to remit premiums on policies covering loans that are not delinquent. Our policies generally allow us to cancel coverage on loans that are not delinquent if the premiums are not paid within a grace period. 
 An increase in delinquent loans or a transfer of servicing resulting from liquidity issues, may increase the operational burden on servicers, cause a disruption in the servicing of delinquent loans and reduce servicers abilities to undertake mitigation efforts that could help limit our losses. 
 The information presented in this report and on our website with respect to the mortgage loans we insure is based on information reported to us by third parties, including the servicers and originators of the mortgage loans, and information presented may be subject to lapses or inaccuracies in reporting from such third parties. In many cases, we may not be aware that information reported to us is incorrect until such time as a claim is made against us under the relevant insurance policy. We do not consistently receive monthly policy status information from servicers for single premium policies, and may not be aware that the mortgage loans insured by such policies have been repaid. We periodically attempt to determine if coverage is still in force on such policies by asking the last servicer of record or through the periodic reconciliation of loan information with certain servicers. It may be possible that our reports continue to reflect, as active, policies on mortgage loans that have been repaid. 
 
 Risk Factors Relating to Our Business Generally 
 If our risk management programs are not effective in identifying, or adequate in controlling or mitigating, the risks we face, or if the models we use are inaccurate, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our enterprise risk management program, described in Business - Our Products and Services - Risk Management in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, may not be effective in identifying, or adequate in controlling or mitigating, the risks we face in our business. 
 We employ proprietary and third-party models for a wide range of purposes, including the following projecting losses, premiums, expenses, and returns pricing products (through our risk-based pricing system) determining the techniques used to underwrite insurance estimating reserves evaluating risk determining internal capital requirements and performing stress testing. These models rely on estimates, projections, and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may not always operate as intended. This can be especially true when extraordinary events occur, such as wars, periods of extreme inflation, pandemics, or environmental disasters related to changing climatic conditions. In addition, our models are being continuously updated over time. Changes in models or model assumptions could lead to material changes in our future expectations, returns, or financial results. The models we employ are complex, which could increase our risk of error in their design, implementation, or use. Also, the associated input data, assumptions, and calculations may not always be correct or accurate and the controls we have in place to mitigate these risks may not be effective in all cases. The risks related to our models may increase when we change assumptions, methodologies, or modeling platforms. Moreover, we may use information we receive through enhancements to refine or otherwise change existing assumptions and or methodologies. 

Information technology system failures or interruptions may materially impact our operations and or adversely affect our financial results. 
 We are heavily dependent on our information technology systems to conduct our business. Our ability to efficiently operate our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of our systems and technology. The failure of our systems and technology, or our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, to operate effectively could affect our ability to provide our products and services to customers, reduce efficiency, or cause delays in operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any such problems. We are also dependent on our ongoing relationships with key technology providers, including provisioning of their products and technologies, and 

their ability to support those products and technologies. The inability of these providers to successfully provide and support those products could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 From time to time we upgrade, automate or otherwise transform our information systems, business processes, risk-based pricing system, and our system for evaluating risk. Certain information systems have been in place for a number of years and it has become increasingly difficult to support their operation. The implementation of technological and business process improvements, as well as their integration with customer and third-party systems when applicable, is complex, expensive and time consuming. If we fail to timely and successfully implement and integrate the new technology systems, if the third party providers upon which we are reliant do not perform as expected, if our legacy systems fail to operate as required, or if the upgraded systems and or transformed and automated business processes do not operate as expected, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 We could be materially adversely affected by a cybersecurity breach or failure of information security controls. 
 As part of our business, we maintain large amounts of confidential and proprietary information both on our own servers and those of cloud computing services. This includes personal information of consumers and our employees. Personal information is subject to an increasing number of federal and state laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Any failure or perceived failure by us, or by the vendors with whom we share this information, to comply with such obligations may result in damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs, regulatory penalties or customer dissatisfaction. 
 
 All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including by cyber attacks, such as those involving ransomware. We regularly defend against threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, system failures and disruptions. Threats have the potential to jeopardize the information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks and otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs, regulatory penalties or customer dissatisfaction. We could be similarly affected by threats against our vendors and or third-parties with whom we share information. 
 
 Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that may hinder our ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. Such attacks may also increase as a result of retaliation by threat actors against actions taken by the U.S. and other countries in connection with wars and other global events. We operate under a hybrid workforce model and such model may be more vulnerable to security breaches. 
 
 While we have information security policies and systems in place to secure our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of sensitive information, there can be no assurance with respect to our systems and those of our third-party vendors that unauthorized access to the systems or disclosure of sensitive information, either through the actions of third parties or employees, will not occur. Due to our reliance on information technology systems, including ours and those of our customers and third-party service providers, and to the sensitivity of the information that we maintain, unauthorized access to the systems or disclosure of the information could adversely affect our reputation, severely disrupt our operations, result in a loss of business and expose us to material claims for damages and may require that we provide free credit monitoring services to individuals affected by a security breach. 
 
 Should we experience an unauthorized disclosure of information or a cyber attack, including those involving ransomware, some of the costs we incur may not be recoverable through insurance, or legal or other processes, and this may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Our underwriting practices and the mix of business we write affects our Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs, our premium yields and the likelihood of losses occurring. 
 The Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs are, in part, a function of the direct risk-in-force and the risk profile of the loans we insure, considering LTV ratio, credit score, vintage, Home Affordable Refinance Program HARP status and delinquency status and whether the loans were insured under lender-paid mortgage insurance policies or other policies that are not subject to automatic termination consistent with the Homeowners Protection Act requirements for borrower-paid mortgage insurance. Therefore, if our direct risk-in-force increases through increases in NIW, or if our mix of business changes to include loans with higher LTV ratios or lower FICO scores, for example, all other things equal, we will be required to hold more Available Assets in order to maintain GSE eligibility. 
 Depending on the actual life of a single premium policy and its premium rate relative to that of a monthly premium policy, a single premium policy may generate more or less premium than a monthly premium policy over its life. The percentage of our NIW from all single premium policies was 2.6 in the first three quarters of 2024. Beginning in 2012, the annual percentage of our NIW from single premium policies has been as low as 4.0 in 2023 and as high as 20.4 in 2015. 

As discussed in our risk factor titled Reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, and or the GSEs may reduce the amount of capital credit we receive for our reinsurance transactions , we have in place various QSR transactions. Although the transactions reduce our premiums, they have a lesser impact on our overall results, as losses ceded under the transactions reduce our losses incurred and the ceding commissions we receive reduce our underwriting expenses. The effect of the QSR transactions on the various components of pre-tax income will vary from period to period, depending on the level of ceded losses incurred. We also have in place various XOL reinsurance transactions under which we cede premiums. Under the XOL reinsurance transactions, for the respective reinsurance coverage periods, we retain the first layer of aggregate losses and the reinsurers provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. 
 In addition to the effect of reinsurance on our premiums, if credit performance remains strong and loss ratios remain low, we expect a decline in our in force portfolio yield over time as competition in the industry results in lower premium rates. Refinance transactions on single premium policies benefit the yield due to the impact of accelerated earned premium from cancellation prior to their estimated life. Recent low levels of refinance transactions have reduced that benefit. 
 Our ability to rescind insurance coverage became more limited for new insurance written beginning in mid-2012, and it became further limited for new insurance written under our revised master policy that became effective March 1, 2020. These limitations may result in higher losses paid than would be the case under our previous master policies. 
 From time to time, in response to market conditions, we change the types of loans that we insure. We also may change our underwriting guidelines, including by agreeing with certain approval recommendations from a GSE automated underwriting system. We also make exceptions to our underwriting requirements on a loan-by-loan basis and for certain customer programs. Our underwriting requirements are available on our website at http www.mgic.com underwriting index.html. 
 
 Even when home prices are stable or rising, mortgages with certain characteristics have higher probabilities of claims. As of September 30, 2024, mortgages with these characteristics in our primary risk in force included mortgages with LTV ratios greater than 95 (16 ), mortgages with borrowers having FICO scores below 680 (6 ), including those with borrowers having FICO scores of 620-679 (6 ), mortgages with limited underwriting, including limited borrower documentation (1 ), and mortgages with borrowers having DTI ratios greater than 45 (or where no ratio is available) (19 ). Each attribute is determined at the time of loan origination. Loans with more than one of these attributes accounted for 5 of our primary risk in force as of September 30, 2024, and 5 and 4 of our primary risk in force as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. When home prices increase, interest rates increase and or the percentage of our NIW from purchase transactions increases, our NIW on mortgages with higher LTV ratios and higher DTI ratios may increase. Our NIW on mortgages with LTV ratios greater than 95 was 14 for the first three quarters of 2024, 12 for the first three quarters of 2023, and 12 for the full year of 2023. Our NIW on mortgages with DTI ratios greater than 45 was 29 in the first three quarters of 2024, 25 in first three quarters of 2023, and 26 for the full year of 2023. Our NIW on mortgages with borrowers having FICO scores less than 680 was 3.9 for the first three quarters of 2024, 4.4 for the first three quarters of 2023, and 4.2 for the full year of 2023. 
 
 From time to time, we change the processes we use to underwrite loans. For example we rely on information provided to us by lenders that was obtained from certain of the GSEs automated appraisal and income verification tools, which may produce results that differ from the results that would have been determined using different methods we accept GSE appraisal waivers for certain loans and we accept GSE appraisal flexibilities that allow property valuations in certain transactions to be based on appraisals that do not involve an onsite or interior inspection of the property. Our acceptance of automated GSE appraisal and income verification tools, GSE appraisal waivers and GSE appraisal flexibilities may affect our pricing and risk assessment. We also continue to further automate our underwriting processes and it is possible that our automated processes result in our insuring loans that we would not otherwise have insured under our prior processes. 
 Approximately 71 of our NIW in the first three quarters of 2024 and 71 of our 2023 NIW was originated under delegated underwriting programs pursuant to which the loan originators had authority on our behalf to underwrite the loans for our mortgage insurance. For loans originated through a delegated underwriting program, we depend on the originators' compliance with our guidelines and rely on the originators' representations that the loans being insured satisfy the underwriting guidelines, eligibility criteria and other requirements. While we have established systems and processes to monitor whether certain aspects of our underwriting guidelines were being followed by the originators, such systems may not ensure that the guidelines were being strictly followed at the time the loans were originated. 
 The widespread use of risk-based pricing systems by the private mortgage insurance industry (discussed in our risk factor titled Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and or increase our losses makes it more difficult to compare our premium rates to those offered by our competitors. We may not be aware of industry rate changes until we observe that our mix of new insurance written has changed and our mix may fluctuate more as a result. 

In March 2024, the National Association of Realtors NAR reached a settlement agreement to resolve a series of lawsuits against it. As part of the settlement, NAR now prohibits the requirement that home sellers, through the seller's agent commission structure, offer to pay the real estate brokerage fees of homebuyers' real estate agents in order to list for-sale properties on NAR-affiliated Multiple Listing Services. If the expense of the buyer's agent commission is shifted to the buyer, it may negatively impact the ability of the buyer to secure financing. 
 
 The premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liabilities for losses and as a result any inadequacy could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 When we set our premiums at policy issuance, we have expectations regarding likely performance of the insured risks over the long term. Generally, we cannot cancel mortgage insurance coverage or adjust renewal premiums during the life of a policy. As a result, higher than anticipated claims generally cannot be offset by premium increases on policies in force or mitigated by our non-renewal or cancellation of insurance coverage. Our premiums are subject to approval by state regulatory agencies, which can delay or limit our ability to increase premiums on future policies. In addition, our customized rate plans may delay our ability to increase premiums on future policies covered by such plans. The premiums we charge, the investment income we earn and the amount of reinsurance we carry may not be adequate to compensate us for the risks and costs associated with the insurance coverage provided to customers. An increase in the number or size of claims, compared to what we anticipated when we set the premiums, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Our premium rates are also based in part on the amount of capital we are required to hold against the insured risk. If the amount of capital we are required to hold increases from the amount we were required to hold when we set the premiums, our returns may be lower than we assumed. For a discussion of the amount of capital we are required to hold, see our risk factor titled We may not continue to meet the GSEs private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease if we are required to maintain more capital in order to maintain our eligibility . 
 If state or federal regulations or statutes are changed in ways that ease mortgage lending standards and or requirements, or if lenders seek ways to replace business in times of lower mortgage originations, it is possible that more mortgage loans could be originated with higher risk characteristics than are currently being originated, such as loans with lower FICO scores and higher DTI ratios. The focus of the FHFA leadership on increasing homeownership opportunities for borrowers is likely to have this effect. Lenders could pressure mortgage insurers to insure such loans, which are expected to experience higher claim rates. Although we attempt to incorporate these higher expected claim rates into our underwriting and pricing models, there can be no assurance that the premiums earned and the associated investment income will be adequate to compensate for actual losses paid even under our current underwriting requirements. 
 
 Actual or perceived instability in the financial services industry or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties could materially impact our business. 
 Limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry with which we do business, or concerns or rumors about the possibility of such events, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. Such conditions may negatively impact our results and or financial condition. While we are unable to predict the full impact of these conditions, they may lead to among other things disruption to the mortgage market, delayed access to deposits or other financial assets losses of deposits in excess of federally-insured levels reduced access to, or increased costs associated with, funding sources and other credit arrangements adequate to finance our current or future operations increased regulatory pressure the inability of our counterparties and or customers to meet their obligations to us economic downturn and rising unemployment levels. Refer to our risk factor titled Downturns in the domestic economy or declines in home prices may result in more homeowners defaulting and our losses increasing, with a corresponding decrease in our returns for more information about the potential effects of a deterioration of economic conditions on our business. 
 We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, reinsurers, and our customers. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk and losses in the event of a default by a counterparty or customer. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We rely on our management team and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or successfully develop and or recruit their replacements. 
 Our success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team and other key personnel. The unexpected departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to obtain other personnel to manage and operate our business. In addition, we will be required to replace the knowledge and expertise of our aging workforce as our workers retire. In either case, there can be no assurance that we would be able to develop or recruit suitable replacements for the departing individuals that replacements could be hired, if necessary, on terms that are favorable to us or that we can successfully transition such replacements in a timely manner. We currently have not entered into any employment agreements with our officers or key personnel. Volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may affect our ability to retain our key personnel or attract replacements should key personnel depart. Without a properly skilled and 

experienced workforce, our costs, including productivity costs and costs to replace employees may increase, and this could negatively impact our earnings. 
 
 Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and or increase our losses. 
 The private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive and is expected to remain so. We believe we currently compete with other private mortgage insurers based on premium rates, underwriting requirements, financial strength (including based on credit or financial strength ratings), customer relationships, name recognition, reputation, strength of management teams and field organizations, the ancillary products and services provided to lenders, and the effective use of technology and innovation in the delivery and servicing of our mortgage insurance products. Changes in the competitive landscape, including as a result of new market entrants, may adversely impact our results. 
 Our relationships with our customers, which may affect the amount of our NIW, could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including if our premium rates are higher than those of our competitors, our underwriting requirements are more restrictive than those of our competitors, our customers are dissatisfied with our claims-paying practices (including insurance policy rescissions and claim curtailments), or the availability of alternatives to mortgage insurance. 
 In recent years, the industry has materially reduced its use of standard rate cards, which were fairly consistent among competitors, and correspondingly increased its use of (i) pricing systems that use a spectrum of filed rates to allow for formulaic, risk-based pricing based on multiple attributes that may be quickly adjusted within certain parameters, and (ii) customized rate plans. The widespread use of risk-based pricing systems by the private mortgage insurance industry makes it more difficult to compare our rates to those offered by our competitors. We may not be aware of industry rate changes until we observe that our volume of NIW has changed. In addition, business under customized rate plans is awarded by certain customers for only limited periods of time. As a result, our NIW may fluctuate more than it had in the past. Failure to maintain our business relationships and business volumes with our largest customers could materially impact our business. Regarding the concentration of our new business, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 37 and 37 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 We monitor various competitive and economic factors while seeking to balance both profitability and market share considerations in developing our pricing strategies. Our premium yield is expected to decline over time as older insurance policies with premium rates that are generally higher run off and new insurance policies with premium rates that are generally lower remain on our books. 
 Certain of our competitors have access to capital at a lower cost than we do (including, through off-shore intercompany reinsurance vehicles, which have tax advantages that may increase if U.S. corporate income taxes increase). As a result, they may be able to achieve higher after-tax rates of return on their NIW compared to us, which could allow them to leverage reduced premium rates to gain market share, and they may be better positioned to compete outside of traditional mortgage insurance, including by participating in alternative forms of credit enhancement pursued by the GSEs discussed in our risk factor titled The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance or are unable to obtain capital relief for mortgage insurance . 
 Adverse rating agency actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Financial strength ratings, which various rating agencies publish as independent opinions of an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet ongoing insurance and contract obligations, are important to maintaining public confidence in our mortgage insurance coverage and our competitive position. PMIERs requires approved insurers to maintain at least one rating with a rating agency acceptable to the respective GSEs. Downgrades in our financial strength ratings could materially affect our business and results of operations, including in the ways described below 
 
 Our failure to maintain a rating acceptable to the GSEs could impact our eligibility as an approved insurer under PMIERs. 
 A downgrade in our financial strength ratings could result in increased scrutiny of our financial condition by the GSEs and or our customers, potentially resulting in a decrease in the amount of our NIW. 
 If we are unable to compete effectively in the current or any future markets as a result of the financial strength ratings assigned to our insurance subsidiaries, our future NIW could be negatively affected. 
 Our ability to participate in the non-GSE residential mortgage-backed securities market (the size of which has been limited since 2008, but may grow in the future), could depend on our ability to maintain and improve our investment grade ratings for our insurance subsidiaries. We could be competitively disadvantaged with some market participants because the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are lower than those of 

some competitors. MGIC's financial strength rating from A.M. Best is A (with a stable outlook), from Moody s is A3 (with a positive outlook) and from Standard & Poor s is A- (with a stable outlook) . 
 Financial strength ratings may also play a greater role if the GSEs no longer operate in their current capacities, for example, due to legislative or regulatory action. In addition, although the PMIERs do not require minimum financial strength ratings, the GSEs consider financial strength ratings to be important when using forms of credit enhancement other than traditional mortgage insurance, as discussed in our risk factor titled The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance or are unable to obtain capital relief for mortgage insurance. The final GSE capital framework provides more capital credit for transactions with higher rated counterparties, as well as those who are diversified. Although we are currently unaware of a direct impact on MGIC, this could potentially become a competitive disadvantage in the future. 
 Downgrades to our ratings or the ratings of our mortgage insurance subsidiary could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, and access to capital markets . 
 
 We are subject to the risk of legal proceedings. 
 We operate in a highly regulated industry that is subject to the risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings, including related to our claims paying practices. From time to time, we are a party to material litigation and are also subject to legal and regulatory claims, assertions, actions, reviews, audits, inquiries and investigations. Additional lawsuits, legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries or other matters may arise in the future. The outcome of future legal and regulatory proceedings, inquiries or other matters could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief which could require significant expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See our risk factor titled We are subject to comprehensive regulation and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy for additional information about risks related to government enforcement actions . 
 From time to time, we are involved in disputes and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, based on the facts known at this time, the ultimate resolution of these ordinary course disputes and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Under ASC 450-20, until a loss associated with settlement discussions or legal proceedings becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated, we do not accrue an estimated loss. When we determine that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we record our best estimate of our probable loss. In those cases, until settlement negotiations or legal proceedings are concluded it is possible that we will record an additional loss. 
 
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio. 
 Our investment portfolio is an important source of revenue and is our primary source of claims paying resources. Although our investment portfolio consists mostly of high quality, investment-grade fixed income investments, our investment portfolio is affected by general economic conditions and tax policy, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and, consequently, the value of our fixed income securities. Prevailing market rates have increased for various reasons, including inflationary pressures, which has reduced the fair value of our investment portfolio holdings relative to their amortized cost. The value of our investment portfolio may also be adversely affected by ratings downgrades, increased bankruptcies, and credit spreads widening. In addition, the collectability and valuation of our municipal bond portfolio may be adversely affected by budget deficits, and declining tax bases and revenues experienced by state and local municipalities. Our investment portfolio also includes commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, and asset-backed securities, which could be adversely affected by declines in real estate valuations, increases in unemployment, geopolitical risks and or financial market disruption, including more restrictive lending conditions and a heightened collection risk on the underlying loans. As a result of these matters, we may not achieve our investment objectives and a reduction in the market value of our investments could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We carry certain financial instruments at fair value and disclose the fair value of all financial instruments. Valuations use inputs and assumptions that are not always observable or may require estimation valuation methods may be complex and may also require estimation, thereby resulting in values that are less certain and may vary significantly from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. For additional information about the methodologies, estimates and assumptions we use in determining the fair value of our investments refer to Note 3 of Item 8 in Part II our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 - Fair Value Measurements. 
 
 Federal budget deficit concerns and the potential for political conflict over the U.S. government s debt limit may increase the possibility of a default by the U.S. government on its debt obligations, related credit-rating downgrades, or an economic recession in the United States. Many of our investment securities are issued by the U.S. government and government agencies and sponsored entities. As a result of uncertain domestic political conditions, including potential future federal government shutdowns, the possibility of the federal government defaulting on its obligations 

due to debt ceiling limitations or other unresolved political issues, investments in financial instruments issued or guaranteed by the federal government pose liquidity risks. Any potential downgrades by rating agencies in long-term sovereign credit ratings, as well as sovereign debt issues facing the governments of other countries, could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions worldwide. 
 
 For the significant portion of our investment portfolio that is held by MGIC, to receive full capital credit under insurance regulatory requirements and under the PMIERs, we generally are limited to investing in investment grade fixed income securities whose yields reflect their lower credit risk profile. Our investment income depends upon the size of the portfolio and its reinvestment at prevailing interest rates. A prolonged period of low investment yields would have an adverse impact on our investment income as would a decrease in the size of the portfolio. 
 We structure our investment portfolio to satisfy our expected liabilities, including claim payments in our mortgage insurance business. If we underestimate our liabilities or improperly structure our investments to meet these liabilities, we could have unexpected losses resulting from the forced liquidation of fixed income investments before their maturity, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 The inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations, pay future shareholder dividends and or make future share repurchases. 
 
 MGIC Investment Corporation is the holding company for our insurance operating subsidiaries. At the holding company level, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries and cash and investments. Dividends and other permitted distributions from MGIC are the holding company's primary source of funds used to meet ongoing cash requirements, including future debt service payments, repurchases of its shares, payment of dividends to our shareholders, and other expenses. Other sources of holding company cash inflow include investment income and raising capital in the public markets. The payment of dividends from MGIC is subject to regulatory approval as described in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and may not be paid if disapproved by the OCI. The prescribed limits are based on a rolling 12-month period, and as such, the impact of the limitations will vary over time. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, MGIC paid 650 million in dividends to the holding company. Future dividend payments from MGIC to the holding company will be determined in consultation with the board of directors, and after considering any updated estimates about our business, subject to regulatory approval. 
 
 The long-term debt obligations are owed by the holding company and not its subsidiaries. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 841 million in cash and investments at our holding company and our holding company s long-term debt obligations were 650 million in aggregate principal amount. Annual debt service on the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2024, is approximately 34 million. The inability of MGIC to pay dividends (or other intercompany amounts due) in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have an adverse effect on our operations, and our ability to repay debt, repurchase shares and or pay dividends to shareholders. 
 
 If any capital contributions to our subsidiaries are required, such contributions would decrease our holding company cash and investments. 
 
 Your ownership in our company may be diluted by additional capital that we raise. 
 As noted above under our risk factor titled We may not continue to meet the GSEs private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease if we are required to maintain more capital in order to maintain our eligibility, although we are currently in compliance with the requirements of the PMIERs, there can be no assurance that we would not seek to issue additional debt capital or to raise additional equity or equity-linked capital to manage our capital position under the PMIERs or for other purposes. Any future issuance of equity securities may dilute your ownership interest in our company. In addition, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. 
 
 The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for holders to resell common stock when they want or at a price they find attractive. 
 The market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly. In addition to the risk factors described herein, the following factors may have an adverse impact on the market price for our common stock changes in general conditions in the economy, the mortgage insurance industry or the financial stability of markets and financial services industry announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions or strategic initiatives our actual or anticipated quarterly and annual operating results changes in expectations of future financial performance (including incurred losses on our insurance in force) changes in estimates of securities analysts or rating agencies actual or anticipated changes in our share repurchase program or dividends changes in operating performance or market valuation of companies in the mortgage insurance industry the addition or departure of key personnel changes in tax law and adverse press or news announcements affecting us or the industry. In addition, ownership by certain types of investors may affect the market price and trading volume of our common stock. For example, ownership in our common stock by investors such as index funds and exchange-traded funds can affect the stock s price when those investors must purchase or sell our common stock because the investors have experienced significant cash inflows 

or outflows, the index to which our common stock belongs has been rebalanced, or our common stock is added to and or removed from an index (due to changes in our market capitalization, for example).
