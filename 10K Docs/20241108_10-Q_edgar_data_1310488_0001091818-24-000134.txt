ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following information should be read in conjunction
with our financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1, above. 

Forward Looking Statements 

Certain matters discussed herein are forward-looking
statements. Such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to: 

our future strategic
plans 

 our future operating
results; 

 our business prospects; 

 our contractual arrangements
and relationships with third parties; 

 the dependence of our
future success on the general economy; 

 our possible future financing;
and 

 the adequacy of our cash
resources and working capital. 

From time to time, we or our representatives have
made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward-looking statements may be included in, but not limited
to, press releases, oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer or in various filings made by us with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Words or phrases "will likely result", "are expected to", "will continue",
"is anticipated", "estimate", "project or projected", or similar expressions are intended to identify "forward-looking
statements". Such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to and are accompanied by the above discussion of certain
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. 

The risks identified here are not all inclusive. New
risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such risk factors, nor can it assess the
impact of all such risk factors on the company's business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not
be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. 

 The financial information set forth in the following
discussion should be read with the financial statements of BioForce NanoSciences Holdings, Inc. included elsewhere herein. 

Business 

BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. BioForce
or the Company was previously in the business of manufacturing nano-particular measurement devices and molecular printers,
but due to a lack of profitability, the subsidiary of the company that owned that technology filed for bankruptcy. That subsidiary and
related technology was later bought out of bankruptcy by an unrelated third party. Subsequently, new management came into the Company
to pursue a better business model and now the Company s mission is to become a leading provider of natural vitamins, minerals and
other nutritional supplements, powders and beverages, formulated to promote a healthier lifestyle for active individuals in all age ranges.
The Company private labels products with key distributors and manufacturing providers. 

BioForce entered into the supplement business in or
about 2015. These supplements, powders and beverages offer vitamins and minerals to complement a healthy intake of protein and carbohydrates
for active individuals and participants in sports. 

BioForce recently changed its business plan and it
is in the process of establishing a dynamic marketing campaign to achieve brand awareness of its product offerings to drive business growth
through sales of nutrition supplements to retailers, sporting goods retailers, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, and online. BioForce
currently markets its products through social media and telemarketing. The Company plans to expand marketing efforts with a direct marketing
and B2B (Business to Business) sales campaign, with the eventual expectation to expand throughout the entire United States. 

The Company proactively seeks to expand its BioForce
Eclipse nutritional powder for use into households throughout the U.S., and the Company will approach retail stores, including
health food and sporting goods stores to create a vendor relationship. During this phase, the Company will continue to try to advance
its social media platform with direct online and targeted advertisements to health conscience individuals. 

- 10 - 

Nutrition retailers, grocery stores, retail pharmacies,
and online stores, like Amazon, will be important channels for the Company s Eclipse product-lines. In The USA, there are thousands
of direct outlets like grocery stores, pharmacies, hospitals, department stores, medical clinics, surgery clinics, universities, nursing
homes, prisons, and other facilities which are all targets of potential sales of the vitamin and mineral supplemental products. 

BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. sells the BioForce
Eclipse powder multivitamin and mineral supplement without non-compete and non-disclosure agreements. The Company currently private labels
the powder through a manufacturer located in Virginia. The Company has a Supplier Agreement with this manufacturer that gives the Company
non-exclusion rights to market the product. The distributor owns the rights to the formula for this product. If the Company can source
product in a more cost-effective way without diminished quality, the Company would evaluate such opportunities when presented. Currently,
the distributor who provides the private label powder provides Consignment Terms, which allows us to only pay for the product
when it is sold. 

The FDA has rules regarding the fitness for consumption
of foods as well as vitamins and supplements sold to the public, and those laws apply to our product. However, our product does not require
pre-clearance like a drug in order to be sold into the marketplace. 

The Company in May 2020, formed a wholly-owned subsidiary,
Element Acquisition Corporation, a Wyoming corporation,with unlimited common shares authorized, par value 0.001. Element Acquisition
Corporation was formed to pursue potential acquisitions in the media, entertainment, media technology and sports sectors. 

The Company on October 15, 2020 changed the name of
its wholly-owned subsidiary Element Acquisition Corporation, a Wyoming corporation, to BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc., a Wyoming
corporation. Management intends to redomicile BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, into a Wyoming corporation using
its wholly-owned BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc., a Wyoming corporation as the entity for the redomicile corporate action. 

On December 14, 2021, the Company changed the name
of its wholly-owned subsidiary, BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, to its new name, Element Global, Inc. 

Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") 

September 02, 2021, Bioforce Nanosciences Holdings,
Inc. entered into another Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Element Global, Inc. (ELGL), a Utah Corporation. This MOU contemplates
a proposed transaction between the entities that provides for BFNH to acquire all of the assets controlled by ELGL. The closing of the
transaction is subject to due diligence and the execution of a definitive agreement. As of the date of this filing the MOU is still active. 

Business Advisory Committee

comprised of leading executives with extensive experience in the media, entertainment and sports sectors. The Committee was established
to oversee a strategy aimed at acquiring and investing in companies across these industries. 

The Committee members are the following individuals:

As indicated herein, we need capital for the implementation

our operating expenses at this time. Unless the company is able to raise working capital, it is likely that the Company will either have
to cease operations or substantially change its methods of operations or change its business plan (See Note 4 in Financial Statements).
For the next 12 months the Company has a written commitment from its Chairman Mr. Merle Ferguson's to advance funds as necessary in meeting

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. does not expect
the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company, or any of its subsidiaries' operating
results, financial position, or cash flow. 

Accounting Principals 

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates
and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition
and impairment of long-lived assets. 

- 13 - 

Revenue Recognition 

In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (" ASC 606"), revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred
to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: (1) Identify the contract with a client; (2) Identify the performance
obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the
contract; and (5) Recognize revenues when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation. 

We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018. Although the
new revenue standard is expected to have an immaterial impact, if any, on our ongoing net income, we did implement changes to our processes
related to revenue recognition and the control activities within them. 

Share Structure 

We were authorized to issue 900,000,000 shares of
our common stock, of which 29,271,755 shares are outstanding. Our shares of common stock are held by approximately 235 stockholders of
record. The number of record holders was determined from the records of our transfer agent and does not include beneficial owners of our
common stock whose shares are held in the names of various securities brokers, dealers, and registered clearing agencies. In addition
to our authorized common stock, BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value at 0.001 per share. Based on the amended Articles of Incorporation the Company has 10,000,000 Series 'A' Preferred which have voting
and conversion rights of 100 common shares, par value 0.001; leaving a balance of 90,000,000 "Blank Check" Preferred. There
are no Series 'A' Preferred shares issued or outstanding. 

Going Concern 

We have incurred net losses since our inception. We
anticipate incurring additional losses before realizing growth in revenue and we will depend on additional financing in order to meet
our continuing obligations and ultimately to attain profitability. Our ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the issuance
of additional equity or through the assumption of debt, is uncertain. Accordingly, our independent auditors' report on our financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern,
including additional information contained in the notes to our financial statements describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business.

10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based on our evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer, after considering the existence of material weaknesses identified, determined that our internal control
over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. 

- 14 - 

Our internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our
financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management, including our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024.
In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
("COSO") in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). 

We identified the following deficiencies which together
constitute a material weakness in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30,
2024: 

- 
 The Company has inadequate segregation of duties within its cash disbursement control design. 

- 
 During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company internally performed all aspects of its financial reporting process, including, but not limited to the underlying accounting records and the recording of journal entries and for the preparation of financial statements. This process was deficient, because these duties were performed often times by the same people, and therefore a lack of review was created over the financial reporting process that might result in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or assumptions used to compile the financial statements and related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

It should be noted that any system of controls, however
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition,
the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and
other inherent limitations of control system, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. 

This report does not include an attestation report
of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject
to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit
us to provide only management's report in this annual report. 

We regularly review our system of internal control
over financial reporting to ensure that we maintain an effective internal control environment. If deficiencies appear in our internal
controls, management will make changes that address those deficiencies. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in the Company's internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the reporeting period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
