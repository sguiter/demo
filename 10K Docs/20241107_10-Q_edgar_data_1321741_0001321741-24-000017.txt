As of March 31, 2024, our loans to Edge and J.R. Hobbs were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of million, or of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio, and an aggregate fair value of million, or of the fair value of all debt investments in our portfolio. 
 Paid-in-kind PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in the loan agreement, is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of PIK income may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we did not have any loans with a PIK interest component. 
 Success Fee Income Recognition 
 We record success fees as income when earned, which often occurs upon receipt of cash. Success fees are generally contractually due upon a change of control in a portfolio company, typically resulting from an exit or sale, and are non-recurring.

 (A) Average total assets subject to the base management fee is defined in the Advisory Agreement as total assets, including investments made with proceeds of borrowings, less any uninvested cash or cash equivalents resulting from borrowings, valued at the end of the applicable quarters within the respective periods and adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the periods. 
 (B) Reflected as a line item on our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations . 
 (C) The capital gains-based incentive fees are recorded in accordance with GAAP and do not necessarily reflect amounts contractually due under the terms of the Advisory Agreement. 
 Base Management Fee 
 The base management fee is payable quarterly to the Adviser pursuant to our Advisory Agreement and is assessed at an annual rate of , computed on the basis of the value of our average gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed quarters (inclusive of the current quarter), which are total assets, including investments made with proceeds of borrowings, less any uninvested cash or cash equivalents resulting from borrowings, valued at the end of the applicable quarters within the respective period and adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period. 
 Additionally, pursuant to the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Adviser makes available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. The Adviser may also provide other services to our portfolio companies under certain agreements and may receive fees for services other than managerial assistance. Such services may include: (i) assistance obtaining, sourcing or structuring credit facilities, long term loans or additional equity from unaffiliated third parties; (ii) negotiating important contractual financial relationships; (iii) consulting services regarding restructuring of the portfolio company and financial modeling as it relates to raising additional debt and equity capital from unaffiliated third parties; and (iv) taking a primary role in interviewing, vetting and negotiating employment contracts with candidates in connection with adding and retaining key portfolio company management team members. The Adviser non-contractually, unconditionally, and irrevocably credits of any fees received for such services against the base management fee that we would otherwise be required to pay to the Adviser; however, pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, a small percentage of certain of such fees was retained by the Adviser in the form of reimbursement, at cost, for tasks completed by personnel of the Adviser, primarily related to the valuation of portfolio companies. For the three and six months ended September 30,

 thousand and thousand, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, these credits totaled thousand and thousand, respectively. 
 Loan Servicing Fee 
 The Adviser also services the loans held by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Business Investment (the borrower under the Credit Facility), in return for which the Adviser receives a annual fee based on the monthly aggregate outstanding balance of loans pledged under the Credit Facility. Since Business Investment is a consolidated subsidiary of ours, coupled with the fact that the total base management fee paid to the Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement cannot exceed of total assets (less any uninvested cash or cash equivalents resulting from borrowings) during any given calendar year, we treat payment of the loan servicing fee pursuant to the Credit Facility as a pre-payment of the base management fee under the Advisory Agreement. Accordingly, these loan servicing fees are non-contractually, unconditionally, and irrevocably credited back to us by the Adviser. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee payable to the Adviser under our Advisory Agreement consists of two parts: an income-based incentive fee and a capital gains-based incentive fee. 
 The income-based incentive fee rewards the Adviser if our quarterly net investment income (before giving effect to any incentive fee) exceeds of our net assets, which we define as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable or contractually due but not payable during the period, at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period (the Hurdle Rate ). The income-based incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income is payable quarterly to the Adviser and is computed as follows: 
 incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the Hurdle Rate; 
 of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than of our net assets, adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period, in any calendar quarter; and 
 of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds of our net assets, adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period, in any calendar quarter. 
 The second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains-based incentive fee that is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals of our realized capital gains, less any realized capital losses and unrealized depreciation, calculated as of the end of the preceding calendar year. The capital gains-based incentive fee payable to the Adviser is calculated based on (i) cumulative aggregate realized capital gains since our inception, less (ii) cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since our inception, less (iii) the entire portfolio s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, if any, as of the date of the calculation. If this number is positive at the applicable calculation date, then the capital gains-based incentive fee for such year equals of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains-based incentive fees paid in respect of our portfolio in all prior years. For calculation purposes, cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equals the sum of the excess between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the original cost of such investment since our inception. Cumulative aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the deficit between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the original cost of such investment since our inception. The entire portfolio s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, if any, equals the sum of the deficit between the fair value of each investment security as of the applicable calculation date and the original cost of such investment security. As of and for the six months ended September 30, 2024, capital gains-based incentive fees were contractually due to the Adviser. During the year ended March 31, 2024, million capital gains-based incentive fees were contractually due and paid to the Adviser. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 of such amount, less the aggregate amount of capital gains-based incentive fees accrued in all prior years, is recorded, regardless of whether such amount is contractually due under the terms of the Advisory Agreement. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period and prior period accruals are reversed, as appropriate. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an accrual of capital gains-based incentive fees of million and a reversal of capital gains-based incentive fees of million, respectively. During the three and six months ended ended September 30, 2023, we recorded capital gains-based incentive fees of million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had accrued capital gains-based incentive fees of million and million, respectively. 
 Transactions with the Administrator 
 We reimburse the Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement for our allocable portion of the Administrator s expenses incurred while performing services to us, which are primarily rent and salaries and benefits expenses of the Administrator s employees, including our chief financial officer and treasurer, chief valuation officer, chief compliance officer, and general counsel and secretary, and their respective staffs. Two of our executive officers, David Gladstone (our chairman and chief executive officer) and Terry Lee Brubaker (our chief operating officer) serve as members of the board of managers and executive officers of the Administrator, which is indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Gladstone. Another of our officers, Mr. LiCalsi (our general counsel and secretary), serves as the Administrator s president as well as the executive vice president of administration, general counsel, and secretary for the Adviser. 
 Our allocable portion of the Administrator s expenses is generally derived by multiplying the Administrator s total expenses by the approximate percentage of time during the current quarter the Administrator s employees performed services for us in relation to their time spent performing services for all companies serviced by the Administrator. On July 9, 2024, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the directors who are not parties to the Administration Agreement or interested persons of either party, approved the annual renewal of the Administration Agreement through August 31, 2025. Administration fees for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 were million and million, respectively. Administration fees for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 were million and million, respectively. 
 Transactions with Gladstone Securities, LLC 
 Gladstone Securities, LLC Gladstone Securities is a privately held broker dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Gladstone Securities is an affiliate of ours, as its parent company is indirectly owned and controlled by David Gladstone, our chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Gladstone also serves on the board of managers of Gladstone Securities. 
 Other Transactions 
 From time to time, Gladstone Securities provides services, such as investment banking and due diligence services, to certain of our portfolio companies, for which it receives a fee. Any such fees paid by portfolio companies to Gladstone Securities do not impact the fees we pay to the Adviser or the non-contractual, unconditional, and irrevocable credits against the base management fee. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, the fees received by Gladstone Securities from our portfolio companies totaled million. During the three and six months ended months ended September 30, 2023, the fees received by Gladstone Securities from our portfolio companies totaled million.

 Among other things, the Credit Facility contains a performance guaranty that requires us to maintain: (i) a minimum net worth of the greater of million or million plus of all equity and subordinated debt raised, minus of any equity or subordinated debt redeemed or retired after November 16, 2016, which equated to million as of September 30, 2024; (ii) asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness of at least (or such percentage as may be set forth in Section 18 of the 1940 Act, as modified by Section 61 of the 1940 Act); and (iii) our status as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code.

 Fair Value 
 We elected to apply the fair value option of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments , to the Credit Facility, which was consistent with our application of ASC 820 to our investments. Generally, the fair value of the Credit Facility is determined using a yield analysis, which includes a DCF calculation and also takes into account the assumptions the Valuation Team believes market participants would use, including the estimated remaining life, counterparty credit risk, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. As of both September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the Credit Facility was 30-day Term SOFR, with a floor, plus per annum, plus an unused commitment fee of . Generally, an increase or decrease in the discount rate used in the DCF calculation may result in a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, in the fair value of the Credit Facility. As of each of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Credit Facility was valued using Level 3 inputs and any changes in its fair value are recorded in Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of other on our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 OVERVIEW 
 
 General 
 We were incorporated under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware on February 18, 2005. We operate as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company and have elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). To continue to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes and obtain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must meet certain requirements, including certain minimum distribution requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio was comprised of 77.4 in debt investments and 22.6 in equity investments, at cost. 
 We invest by ourselves or jointly with other funds and/or management of the portfolio company, depending on the opportunity. In July 2012, the SEC granted us an exemptive order (the Co-Investment Order that expanded our ability to co-invest, under certain circumstances, with certain of our affiliates, including Gladstone Capital and any future BDC or closed-end management investment company that is advised (or sub-advised if it controls the fund) by the Adviser, or any combination of the foregoing, subject to the conditions in the Co-Investment Order. We believe the Co-Investment Order has enhanced and will continue to enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategies. If we are participating in an investment with one or more co-investors, whether or not an affiliate of ours, our investment is likely to be smaller than if we were investing alone. 
 We are externally managed by the Adviser, an investment adviser registered with the SEC and an affiliate of ours, pursuant to an investment advisory and management agreement (the Advisory Agreement ). The Adviser manages our investment activities. We have also entered into an administration agreement with Gladstone Administration, LLC, an affiliate of ours and the Adviser, whereby we pay separately for administrative services. 
 Our shares of common stock, our 5.00 Notes due 2026 5.00 2026 Notes ), our 4.875 Notes due 2028 ("4.875 2028 Notes") and our 8.00 Notes due 2028 8.00 2028 Notes are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market Nasdaq under the trading symbols GAIN, GAINN, "GAINZ" and GAINL, respectively.

 Business 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 While the business environment remains competitive, we continue to see new investment opportunities consistent with our investment strategy of providing a combination of debt and equity in support of management and independent sponsor-led buyouts of Lower Middle Market companies in the U.S. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we exited two portfolio companies. From our initial public offering in June 2005 through September 30, 2024, we have invested in 58 companies, excluding investments in syndicated loans, for a total of approximately 1.8 billion, before giving effect to principal repayments and divestitures. 
 The majority of the debt securities in our portfolio have a success fee component, which enhances the yield on our debt investments. Unlike paid-in-kind PIK income, we generally do not recognize success fees as income until payment has been received. Due to the contingent nature of success fees, there are no guarantees that we will be able to collect any or all of these success fees or know the timing of any such collections. As a result, as of September 30, 2024, we had unrecognized, contractual success fees of 50.2 million, or 1.37 per common share. Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP ), we have not recognized success fee receivables and related income in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements until earned. 
 From inception through September 30, 2024, we exited our investments of 32 portfolio companies that we acquired under our buyout strategy (which excludes investments in syndicated loans). In the aggregate, these sales have generated 332.5 million in net realized gains and 42.0 million in other income upon exit, for a total increase to our net assets of 374.5 million. We believe, in aggregate, these transactions were equity-oriented investment successes and exemplify our investment strategy of striving to achieve returns through current income on the debt portion of our investments and capital gains from the equity portion. The 32 liquidity events have offset any realized losses since inception, which were primarily incurred during the 2008-2009 recession in connection with the sale of performing syndicated loans at a realized loss to pay off a former lender. The successful exits, in part, enabled us to increase the monthly distribution run rate by 100.0 from March 2011 through September 30, 2024, and allowed us to declare 23 and pay 22 supplemental distributions to common stockholders from March 2012 through September 30, 2024. 
 
 Capital Raising 
 We have been able to meet our capital needs through extensions of and increases to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2013, as amended from time to time (the Credit Facility ), and by accessing the capital markets in the form of public offerings of unsecured notes, as well as common and preferred stock. We have successfully extended the Credit Facility s revolving period multiple times, most recently to October 2026, and currently have a total commitment amount of 200.0 million (with a potential total commitment of 300.0 million through additional commitments from new or existing lenders). During the year ended March 31, 2024, we issued the 8.00 2028 Notes for gross proceeds of 74.8 million and sold 3,097,162 shares of our common stock under our common stock "at-the-market" program ("2022 Common Stock ATM Program") for gross proceeds of approximately 44.5 million. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources Revolving Line of Credit for further discussion of the Credit Facility and to Liquidity and Capital Resources Equity Common Stock further discussion of our common stock. In May 2024, we entered into equity distribution agreements with Oppenheimer Co., B. Riley Securities, Inc. and Virtu Americas LLC (each a Sales Agent ), under which we have the ability to issue and sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, through the Sales Agents, up to an aggregate offering price of 75.0 million in what is commonly referred to as an "at-the-market" program (the "2024 Common Stock ATM Program"). 
 
 Although we have been able to access the capital markets historically, market conditions may continue to affect the trading price of our common stock and thus our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of common equity. On September 30, 2024, the closing market price of our common stock was per share, representing a premium to our net asset value NAV of per share as of September 30, 2024. When our common stock trades below NAV, our ability to issue additional equity is constrained by provisions of the 1940 Act, which generally prohibits the issuance and sale of our common stock at an issuance price below the then-current NAV per share without stockholder approval, other than through sales to our then-existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering.

 Regulatory Compliance 
 Our ability to seek external debt financing, to the extent that it is available under current market conditions, is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the 1940 Act, which require us to have asset coverage (as defined in Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act) of at least 150 on each of our senior securities representing indebtedness and our senior securities that are stock (such as our previously outstanding series of term preferred stock). 
 On April 10, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) thereof, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, our asset coverage requirements for senior securities changed from 200 to 150 , effective as of April 10, 2019, one year after the date of the Board of Directors approval.

 Investment Income 
 Total investment income increased 2.3 million, or 11.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in dividend and success fee income and an increase in interest income. 
 Interest income from our investments in debt securities increased 0.7 million, or 3.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. Generally, the level of interest income from investments is directly related to the weighted-average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio outstanding during the period, multiplied by the weighted-average yield. The weighted-average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 572.8 million, compared to 543.8 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the 84.2 million of follow-on debt investments in existing portfolio companies and the origination of 34.8 million of new debt investments after June 30, 2023, partially offset by 56.0 million of pay-offs, restructurings, or write-offs of debt investments and 30.8 million of loans placed on non-accrual status after June 30, 2023, and their respective impact on the weighted-average principal balance when considering timing of new investments, pay-offs, restructurings, write-offs, and accrual status changes, as applicable. 
 The weighted-average yield on our interest-bearing investments, excluding cash and cash equivalents and receipts recorded as dividend and success fee income, was 14.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.6 for the prior year period. The weighted-average yield may vary from period to period, based on the current stated interest rate on interest-bearing investments, coupled with any collection of past due interest during the period. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our loans to B+T Group Acquisition, Inc. ("B+T"), Diligent Delivery Systems ("Diligent"), Edge Adhesives Holdings, Inc. ("Edge"), and J.R. Hobbs Co. Atlanta, LLC ("J.R. Hobbs") were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of 90.0 million. As of September 30, 2023, our loans to Edge, J.R. Hobbs and The Mountain Corporation were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of 66.9 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Nocturne represented 11.6 and SFEG Holdings, Inc.("SFEG") 10.8 of the total investment portfolio at fair value. As of March 31, 2024, SFEG represented 10.1 of the total investment portfolio at fair value. 
 Dividend and success fee income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.6 million, from the prior year period. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, dividend and success fee income consisted of 1.4 million of dividend income and 0.2 million of success fee income. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, there was no dividend or success fee income. 
 
 Expenses 
 Total expenses, net of any non-contractual, unconditional, and irrevocable credits from the Adviser, decreased 6.7 million, or 30.6 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in incentive fees, partially offset by a decrease in fee credits from the Adviser and an increase in other expense, interest expense, and administration fee expense. 
 In accordance with GAAP, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 1.6 million capital gains-based incentive fee compared to 9.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The capital gains-based incentive fee is a result of the net impact of net realized gains and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments during the respective periods. The income-based incentive fee decreased by 1.1 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in net assets, which drives the hurdle rate and a decrease in pre-incentive fee net investment income.

 Interest expense increased 0.3 million, or 4.8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased borrowings on the Credit Facility and an increase in the effective interest rate. The weighted-average balance outstanding under the Credit Facility during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 60.8 million, compared to 50.4 million in the prior year period. The effective interest rate on the Credit Facility, excluding the impact of deferred financing costs, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.0 , as compared to 10.9 in the prior year period. The increase in the effective interest rate on the Credit Facility was primarily a result of higher interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other expenses increased 0.5 million, or 43.5 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, due to an increase in bad debt expense, professional fees and tax expense.

 Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 Net unrealized depreciation of investments of 34.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the reversal of unrealized appreciation of Nth Degree upon exit, and a decrease in the performance of certain of our portfolio companies. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in transaction multiples used to estimate the fair value of certain of our portfolio companies and increased performance of certain of our other portfolio companies. 
 Net unrealized appreciation of investments of 48.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increased performance of certain of our portfolio companies and an increase in transaction multiples used to estimate the fair value of certain of our portfolio companies, in addition to increased fair value as a result of expected payoff amounts for certain investments. These increases were partially offset by decreased performance of certain of our other portfolio companies. 
 Across our entire investment portfolio, we recorded net unrealized depreciation of 19.4 million on our equity positions and net unrealized depreciation of 14.7 million on our debt positions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . As of September 30, 2024 , the fair value of our investment portfolio was more than the cost basis by 13.2 million, as compared to June 30, 2024, when the fair value of our investment portfolio was more than the cost basis by 47.3 million, representing net unrealized depreciation of 34.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . Our entire portfolio had a fair value of 101.6 of cost as of September 30, 2024 .

 Investment Income 
 Total investment income increased 4.2 million, or 10.3 , for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in interest income, and dividend and success fee income. 
 Interest income from our investments in debt securities increased 3.0 million, or 7.6 , for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. Generally, the level of interest income from investments is directly related to the principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio outstanding during the period, multiplied by the weighted-average yield. 
 The weighted-average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 578.1 million, compared to 519.7 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to 110.9 million of follow-on debt investments in existing portfolio companies, the origination of 85.8 million of new debt investments, partially offset by 56.0 million of pay-offs, restructurings, or write-offs of debt investments and 30.8 million of loans placed on non-accrual status after March 31, 2023, and their respective impact on the weighted-average principal balance when considering timing of new investments, pay-offs, restructurings, write-offs, and accrual status changes, as applicable. 
 The weighted-average yield on our interest-bearing investments, excluding cash and cash equivalents and receipts recorded as dividend and success fee income, was 14.4 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.6 for the prior year period. The weighted-average yield may vary from period to period, based on the current stated interest rate on interest-bearing investments, coupled with any collection of past due interest during the period. During the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no collections of past due interest. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our loans to B+T, Diligent, Edge, and J.R. Hobbs were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of 90.0 million. As of September 30, 2023, our loans to Edge, J.R. Hobbs and The Mountain were also on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of 66.9 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Nocturne represented 11.6 , and SFEG represented 10.8 of the total investment portfolio at fair value. As of March 31, 2024, SFEG represented 10.1 of the total investment portfolio at fair value. 
 Dividend and success fee income for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.2 million, or 63.7 from the prior year period. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, dividend and success fee income consisted of 1.7 million of success fee income and 1.4 million of dividend income. During the six months ended September 30, 2023, dividend and success fee income consisted of 1.9 million of dividend income. 
 
 Expenses 
 Total expenses, net of any non-contractual, unconditional, and irrevocable credits from the Adviser, decreased 8.8 million, or 26.1 , during the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in incentive fees, partially offset by a decrease in fee credits from the Adviser and an increase in interest expense, other expense, and base management fee. 
 In accordance with GAAP, we recorded a 2.2 million reversal of previously accrued capital gains-based incentive fee during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 9.9 million capital gains-based incentive fee recorded during the six months ended September 30, 2023. The capital gains-based incentive fee was a result of the net impact of net realized gains and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments during the respective periods. The income-based incentive fee decreased by 3.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in net assets, which drives the hurdle rate, and a decrease in pre-incentive fee net investment income.

 Interest expense increased 1.8 million, or 16.3 , during the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to interest expense related to the 8.00 2028 Notes issued in May 2023 and increased borrowings on the Credit Facility, partially offset by a decrease in the effective interest rate. The weighted-average balance outstanding on the Credit Facility during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 62.8 million as compared to 47.0 million in the prior year period. The effective interest rate on the Credit Facility, excluding the impact of deferred financing costs, during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.9 , as compared to 11.0 in the prior year period. The decrease in the effective interest rate on the Credit Facility was primarily a result of a decrease in unused commitment fees on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facility, partially offset by higher interest rates on the drawn portion of the Credit Facility during the six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other expenses increased 1.5 million, or 69.5 , during the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, due to an increase in bad debt expense and professional fees.

 Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 Net unrealized depreciation of investments of 53.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the reversal of unrealized appreciation of Nth Degree upon exit and decreased performance of certain of our portfolio companies.

 Net unrealized appreciation of investments of 47.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increased performance of certain of our portfolio companies and an increase in transaction multiples used to estimate the fair value of certain of our portfolio companies, in addition to increased fair value as a result of expected payoff amounts for certain investments. These increases were partially offset by decreased performance of certain of our other portfolio companies.

 Distributions and Dividends to Stockholders 
 Common Stock Distributions 
 To qualify to be taxed as a RIC and thus avoid corporate level federal income tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders, we are required, among other requirements, to distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis at least 90 of our taxable ordinary income plus the excess of our net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses Investment Company Taxable Income ), determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction. Additionally, the Credit Facility generally restricts the amount of distributions to stockholders that we can pay out to be no greater than the sum of certain amounts, including our net investment income, plus net capital gains, plus amounts elected by the Company to be considered as having been paid during the prior fiscal year in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code. In accordance with these requirements, our Board of Directors declared, and we paid, monthly cash distributions of 0.08 per common share for each of the six months from April through September 2024, and a supplemental distribution of 0.70 per common share paid in October 2024. See also Recent Developments - Distributions and Dividends for a discussion of cash distributions to common stockholders declared and paid by our Board of Directors in October 2024. 
 For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, Investment Company Taxable Income exceeded distributions declared and paid, and, in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code, we elected to treat 18.7 million of the first distributions paid subsequent to fiscal year-end as having been paid in the prior year. In addition, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, net capital gains exceeded distributions declared and paid, and, in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code, we elected to treat 1.4 million of the first distributions paid subsequent to fiscal year-end as having been paid in the prior year. For the year ended March 31, 2024, we recorded 0.8 million of net adjustments for estimated permanent book-tax differences to reflect tax character, which increased Overdistributed net investment income and decreased Accumulated net realized gain in excess of distributions and Capital in excess of par value. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 0.8 million of net adjustments for estimated permanent book-tax differences to reflect tax character, which increased Overdistributed net investment income and decreased Capital in excess of par value . 
 Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
 Our common stockholders who hold their shares through our transfer agent, Computershare, Inc. Computershare ), have the option to participate in a dividend reinvestment plan offered by Computershare, as the plan agent. This is an opt in dividend reinvestment plan, meaning that common stockholders may elect to have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Common stockholders who do not make such election will receive their distributions in cash. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will be taxable to a common stockholder to the same extent, and with the same character, as if the common stockholder had received the distribution in cash. The common stockholder generally will have an adjusted basis in the additional common shares purchased through the plan equal to the dollar amount that would have been received if the U.S. stockholder had received the dividend or distribution in cash. The additional common shares will have a new holding period commencing on the day following the date on which the shares are credited to the common stockholder s account. Computershare purchases shares in the open market in connection with the obligations under the plan.

 Equity 
 Registration Statement 
 On February 28, 2024, we filed a registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-277452), which the SEC declared effective on April 18, 2024. The registration statement permits us to issue, through one or more transactions, up to an aggregate of 450.0 million in securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, subscription rights, debt securities, and warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock, or debt securities, including through concurrent, separate offerings of such securities. As of the date of this report, we have the ability to issue all 450.0 million of the securities registered under the registration statement. 
 
 On September 3, 2021, we filed a registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-259302), which the SEC declared effective on October 15, 2021. The registration statement permitted us to issue, through one or more transactions, up to an aggregate of 300.0 million in securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, subscription rights, debt securities, and warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock, or debt securities, including through concurrent, separate offerings of such securities. This registration statement was terminated on April 18, 2024. 
 Common Stock 
 In May 2024, we entered into equity distribution agreements with Oppenheimer Co., B. Riley Securities, Inc. and Virtu Americas LLC (each a Sales Agent ), under which we have the ability to issue and sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, through the Sales Agents, up to an aggregate offering price of 75.0 million in the 2024 Common Stock ATM Program. There were no shares sold under the 2024 Common Stock ATM Program during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had remaining capacity under the 2024 Common Stock ATM Program to sell all 75.0 million. 
 
 In August 2022, we entered into equity distribution agreements with Oppenheimer Co. and Virtu Americas LLC (each a 2022 Sales Agent ), under which we had the ability to issue and sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, through the Sales Agents, up to an aggregate offering price of 50.0 million in what is commonly referred to as an "at-the-market" program (the "2022 Common Stock ATM Program"). In August 2023, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. and entered into amendments to the agreements with Oppenheimer Co. Inc. and Virtu Americas LLC in order to add B. Riley Securities, Inc. as a 2022 Sales Agent for the 2022 Common Stock ATM Program. The 2022 Common Stock ATM Program terminated in connection with our entry into the 2024 Common Stock ATM Program. 
 
 We did not have any sales of common stock during three and six months eneded September 30, 2024. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 304,170 shares of common stock under the 2022 Common Stock ATM Program, with a weighted-average gross price of 13.55 per share and a weighted-average net price of 13.35 per share after deducting commissions and offering costs borne by us, raising approximately 4.1 million and 4.1 million of gross and net proceeds, respectively. All of these sales were above our then current estimated NAV per share. 
 
 We anticipate issuing equity securities to obtain additional capital in the future. However, we cannot determine the timing or terms of any future equity issuances or whether we will be able to issue equity on terms favorable to us, or at all. When our common stock is trading at a price below NAV per share, the 1940 Act places regulatory constraints on our ability to obtain additional capital by issuing common stock. Generally, the 1940 Act provides that we may not issue and sell our common stock at a price below our NAV per common share, other than to our then-existing common stockholders pursuant to a rights offering, without first obtaining approval from our stockholders and our independent directors and meeting other stated requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the closing market price of our common stock was per share, representing a premium to our NAV per share of as of September 30, 2024.

 As of September 30, 2024, advances under the Credit Facility generally bore interest at 30-day Term SOFR, subject to a floor of 0.35 , plus 3.15 per annum until October 30, 2026, with the margin then increasing to 3.40 for the period from October 30, 2026 to October 30, 2027, and increasing further to 3.65 thereafter with a SOFR credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points. The Credit Facility has an unused commitment fee on the daily unused commitment amount of 0.50 per annum if the daily unused commitment amount is less than or equal to 50 of the total commitment amount, 0.75 per annum if the daily unused commitment amount is greater than 50 but less than or equal to 65 of the total commitment amount, and 1.00 per annum if the daily unused commitment amount is greater than 65 of the total commitment amount. 

At September 30, 2024, we had million of borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility and as of the date of this report, we had 40.2 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. 
 
 Interest is payable monthly during the term of the Credit Facility. Available borrowings are subject to various constraints and applicable advance rates, which are generally based on the size, characteristics, and quality of the collateral pledged by Business Investment. The Credit Facility also requires that any interest and principal payments on pledged loans be remitted directly by the borrower into a lockbox account with KeyBank. KeyBank is also the trustee of the account and generally remits the collected funds to us once a month. 
 Among other things, the Credit Facility contains covenants that require Business Investment to maintain its status as a separate legal entity, prohibit certain significant corporate transactions (such as mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions) and restrict certain material changes to our credit and collection policies without the lenders consent. The Credit Facility also generally seeks to restrict distributions to stockholders to the sum of (i) our net investment income, (ii) net capital gains, and (iii) amounts deemed by the Company to be considered as having been paid during the prior fiscal year in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code. Loans eligible to be pledged as collateral are subject to certain limitations, including, among other things, restrictions on geographic concentrations, industry concentrations, loan size, payment frequency and status, average life, portfolio company leverage, and lien property. The Credit Facility also requires Business Investment to comply with other financial and operational covenants, which obligate Business Investment to, among other things, maintain certain financial ratios, including asset and interest coverage and a minimum number of obligors required in the borrowing base. Additionally, the Credit Facility contains a performance guaranty that requires the Company to maintain (i) a minimum net worth of the greater of million or million plus of all equity and subordinated debt raised, minus of any equity or subordinated debt redeemed or retired after November 16, 2016, which equated to million as of September 30, 2024, (ii) asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness of at least (or such percentage as may be set forth in Section 18 of the 1940 Act, as modified by Section 61 of the 1940 Act), and (iii) our status as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code. As of September 30, 2024, and as defined in the performance guaranty of the Credit Facility, we had a net worth of million, asset coverage on our senior securities representing indebtedness of , calculated in compliance with the requirements of Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, and an active status as a BDC and RIC. As of September 30, 2024, we had availability, after adjustments for various constraints based on collateral quality, of million under the Credit Facility and were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.

 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 Unlike PIK income, we generally do not recognize success fees as income until payment has been received. Due to the contingent nature of success fees, there are no guarantees that we will be able to collect any or all of these success fees or know the timing of any such collections. As a result, as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had unrecognized, contractual off-balance sheet success fee receivables of 50.2 million and 44.9 million (or approximately 1.37 and 1.23 per common share), respectively, on our debt investments. Consistent with GAAP, we have not recognized success fee receivables and related income in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements until earned. 
 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
 We have line of credit commitments to certain of our portfolio companies that have not been fully drawn. Since these line of credit commitments have expiration dates and we expect many will never be fully drawn, the total line of credit commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We estimate the fair value of the combined unused line of credit commitments as of September 30, 2024 to be insignificant. 
 The following table shows our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024, at cost: 
 Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (A) 
 Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Credit Facility (B)

 (A) Excludes unused line of credit commitments to our portfolio companies in the aggregate principal of 6.0 million. 
 (B) Principal balance of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, based on the maturity date following the current contractual revolving period end date. 
 (C) Includes interest payments due on the Credit Facility, 5.00 2026 Notes, 4.875 2028 Notes and 8.00 2028 Notes, as applicable. The amount of interest payments calculated for purposes of this table was based upon rates and outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified our investment valuation policy (which has been approved by our Board of Directors) as our most critical accounting policy, which is described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Additionally, refer to Note 3 Investments in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding fair value measurements and our application of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. We have also identified our revenue recognition policy as a critical accounting policy, which is described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

 Investment Valuation 
 Credit Monitoring and Risk Rating 
 The Adviser monitors a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance and, in some instances, are used as inputs in our valuation techniques. Generally, we, through the Adviser, participate in periodic board meetings of our portfolio companies in which we hold board seats and also require them to provide annual audited and monthly unaudited financial statements. Using these statements or comparable information and board discussions, the Adviser calculates and evaluates certain credit statistics. 
 The Adviser risk rates all of our investments in debt securities. The Adviser does not risk rate equity securities. For loans that have been rated by a SEC-registered Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization NRSRO ), the Adviser generally uses the average of two corporate level NRSRO s risk ratings for such security. For all other debt securities, the Adviser uses a proprietary risk rating system. While the Adviser seeks to mirror the NRSRO systems, we cannot provide any assurance that the Adviser s risk rating system will provide the same risk rating as an NRSRO for these securities. The Adviser s risk rating system is used to estimate the probability of default on debt securities and the expected loss, if there is a default. The Adviser s risk rating system uses a scale of 0 to >10, with >10 being the lowest probability of default. It is the Adviser s understanding that most debt securities of Lower Middle Market companies do not exceed the grade of BBB on an NRSRO scale, so there would be no debt securities in the Lower Middle Market that would meet the definition of AAA, AA or A. Therefore, the Adviser s scale begins with the designation >10 as the best risk rating which may be equivalent to a BBB from an NRSRO; however, no assurance can be given that a >10 on the Adviser s scale is equal to a BBB or Baa2 on an NRSRO scale. The Adviser s risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold. 
 The following table reflects risk ratings for all loans in our portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024: 
 Rating September 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 Highest 
 9.0 9.0 Average 
 6.6 6.6 Weighted-average 
 7.0 6.9 Lowest 
 3.0 3.0 
 
 Tax Status 
 We intend to continue to maintain our qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a RIC, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to our stockholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must maintain our status as a BDC and meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify to be taxed as a RIC, we must distribute to stockholders at least 90 of our Investment Company Taxable Income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction. Our policy generally is to make distributions to our stockholders in an amount up to 100 of Investment Company Taxable Income. We may retain some or all of our net long-term capital gains, if any, and designate them as deemed distributions, or distribute such gains to stockholders in cash. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Distributions and Dividends to Stockholders . 
 In an effort to limit federal excise taxes, we have to distribute to stockholders, during each calendar year, an amount close to the sum of: (1) 98 of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our net capital gains (both long-term and short-term), if any, for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding period (to the extent that income tax was not imposed on such amounts), less certain reductions, as applicable. Under the RIC Modernization Act, we are permitted to carryforward any capital losses that we may incur for an unlimited period, and such capital loss carryforwards will retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses. Our capital loss carryforward balance was 0 as of both September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies whose securities are owned by us; conditions affecting the general economy, including public health emergencies; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; and interest rate fluctuations. 
 The primary risk we believe we are exposed to is interest rate risk. Because we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rates at which we borrow funds, such as under the Credit Facility (which is variable) and our unsecured notes (which are fixed), and the rates at which we invest those funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. We use a combination of debt and equity capital to finance our investing activities. We may use interest rate risk management techniques to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. 
 We target to have approximately 90 of the loans in our portfolio at variable rates or variable rates with a floor mechanism, and up to approximately 10 at fixed rates. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, all of our variable-rate loans have rates associated with the current 30-day SOFR rate, and our total debt investment portfolio consisted of the following breakdown based on the principal balance: 
 Rates: September 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 Variable rates with a floor 100.0 100.0 Fixed rates Total 100.0 100.0 
 There have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosures during the six months ended September 30, 2024 from those included in our Annual Report. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness, design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level in timely alerting management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of material information about us required to be included in periodic SEC filings. However, in evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in internal controls for the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While we do not expect that the resolution of these matters, if they arise, would materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, resolution will be subject to various uncertainties and could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
 Not applicable.
