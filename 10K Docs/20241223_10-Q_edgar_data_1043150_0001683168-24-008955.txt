Critical Accounting
Policies 

Our discussion and analysis
of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those
related to provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventories, valuation of intangible assets and contingencies and litigation.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The accounting policies
that we follow are set forth in Note 2 to our financial statements as included in the SEC report filed. These accounting policies conform
to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial
statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, 
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information in this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and
Procedures 

a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 

We conducted an evaluation under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded
as of September 30, 2023, that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the
material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting discussed immediately below. 

Our internal controls are not effective for the
following reasons: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s board
of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2)
inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and
financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls
over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company s
Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of September 30, 2023 and communicated the matters
to our management. 

15 

(b) Management's Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition
of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization
of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting as of September 0, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework . Based on its evaluation,
management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2023. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable, but not absolute,
assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their cost. 

Management believes that the material weaknesses
set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an effect on the Company s financial results. However, management believes
that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s board of directors,
resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the
Company s determination to its financial statements for the future years. 

We are committed to improving our financial organization.
As part of this commitment, we intend to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our
personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing
one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully
functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial
reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes which were identified in
connection with our management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to have a materially affect, on our internal control over financial reporting.
