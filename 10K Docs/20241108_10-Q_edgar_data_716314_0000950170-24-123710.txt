The change in fair value of the contingent earn-out liability was included in other operating income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cost of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and the amount exceeding the fair value of was recorded as goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill generated in the acquisition is related to P3 s assembled workforce, synergies between the Company s other operations and P3 that are expected to occur as a result of the combined engineering knowledge, the ability of each of the operations to leverage each other s technology solutions, and the Company s ability to utilize acquired management knowledge in providing complementary product

The fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets includes customer relationships, technology and technical know-how, and tradename. The tradename is included in the line item other intangible assets, net in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of customer relationships was calculated using an income approach, specifically the Multi Period Excess Earnings method, which incorporates assumptions regarding retention rate, new customer growth and customer related costs. The fair value of tradename and technology and technical know-how were both calculated using a Relief from Royalty method, which develops a market based royalty rate used to reflect the after tax royalty savings attributable to owning the intangible asset. Customer relationships and tradename are amortized in selling, general and administrative expense on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of eight years and three years respectively. Technology and technical know-how is amortized in cost of products sold on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of ten years. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the seller received for tax liabilities owed in accordance with the purchase agreement. The Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 includes net sales for P3 of and , respectively and net (loss) income of and , respectively.

A performance obligation represents a promise in a contract to provide a distinct good or service to a customer. The Company accounts for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferred products. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied. In certain cases, the Company may separate a contract into more than one performance obligation, while in other cases, several products may be part of a fully integrated solution and are bundled into a single performance obligation. If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods underlying each performance obligation. The Company has made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the contract price all taxes assessed by government authorities that are collected by the Company from its customers. The Company does not adjust the contract price for the effects of a financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when a product is transferred to a customer and when the customer pays for the product will be one year or less. Shipping and handling fees billed to the customer are recorded in revenue and the related costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of products sold. The Company recognizes revenue over time when contract performance results in the creation of a product for which the Company does not have an alternative use and the contract includes an enforceable right to payment in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed. To measure progress towards completion on performance obligations for which revenue is recognized over time the Company utilizes an input method based upon a ratio of direct labor hours incurred to date to management s estimate of the total labor hours to be incurred on each contract, an input method based upon a ratio of total contract costs incurred to date to management s estimate of the total contract costs to be incurred or an output method based upon completion of operational milestones, depending upon the nature of the contract. The Company has established the systems and procedures essential to developing the estimates required to account for performance obligations over time. These procedures include monthly review by management of costs incurred, progress towards completion, identified risks and opportunities, sourcing determinations, changes in estimates of costs yet to be incurred, availability of materials, and execution by subcontractors. Sales and earnings are adjusted in current accounting

Revenue recognized at shipment 

The timing of revenue recognition, invoicing and cash collections affect trade accounts receivable, unbilled revenue (contract assets) and customer deposits (contract liabilities) on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unbilled revenue represents revenue on contracts that is recognized over time and exceeds the amount that has been billed to the customer. Unbilled revenue is separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company may have an unconditional right to payment upon billing and prior to satisfying the performance obligations. The Company will then record a contract liability and an offsetting asset of equal amount until the deposit is collected and the performance obligations are satisfied. Customer deposits are separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customer deposits are not considered a significant financing component as they are generally received less than one year before the product is completed or used to procure specific material on a contract, as well as related overhead costs incurred during design and construction.

Receivables billed but not paid under retainage provisions in the Company s customer contracts were and at September 30, and March 31, 2024, respectively. The Company s remaining unsatisfied performance obligations represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. The Company also refers to this measure as backlog. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had remaining unsatisfied performance obligations of . The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately to of the remaining performance obligations within , to in one to and the remaining beyond two years.

over a period of four years and was isolated to GIPL. All involved employees have been terminated and the Company has implemented remedial actions, including strengthening its compliance program and internal controls. As a result of the investigation, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the statutory auditor and bookkeeper of GIPL tendered their resignations and new firms were appointed. The Company has voluntarily reported the findings of its investigation to the appropriate authorities in India and the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although the resolutions of these matters are inherently uncertain, we do not believe any remaining impact will be material to the Company s overall consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was subject to the claims noted above, as well as other potential claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of the lawsuits, legal proceedings or potential claims to which the Company is, or may become, a party to cannot be determined and an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be made for the majority of the claims, management does not believe that the outcomes, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company previously entered into operating leases with Ascent Properties Group, LLC, a limited liability company of which our Chief Executive Officer holds a majority interest, for two building lease agreements and two equipment lease agreements in Arvada, Colorado. In connection with such leases, the Company made fixed minimum lease payments to the lessor of and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company is obligated to make payments of during the remainder of fiscal 2025. Future fixed minimum lease payments under these leases as of September 30, 2024 are . 

liability for unrecognized tax benefits at either September 30, 2024 or March 31, 2024. The income tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of the annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if the estimated effective tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. There is a potential for volatility of the effective tax rate due to several factors, including discrete items, changes in the mix and amount of projected pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, changes in tax laws and foreign tax holidays, business reorganizations, settlements with taxing authorities and foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, the Company continues to explore tax planning opportunities that may have a material impact on its effective tax rate. The Company's effective tax rate as of the second quarter of 2025 was on of income before taxes compared to on of income before taxes for the same period in fiscal 2024. The decrease in the Company's effective tax rate was primarily due to a discrete benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and the Company's improved stock price over the last year. Additionally, the first six months of fiscal 2025 effective tax rate benefited from a higher mix of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 (Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except per share data) 
 
 Overview 
 We are a global leader in the design and manufacture of mission critical fluid, power, heat transfer and vacuum technologies for the defense, space, energy and process industries. For the defense industry, our equipment is used in nuclear and non-nuclear propulsion, power, fluid transfer, and thermal management systems. For the space industry, our equipment is used in propulsion, power and energy management systems and for life support systems. We supply equipment for vacuum, heat transfer and fluid transfer applications used in energy and new energy markets including oil refining, cogeneration, and multiple alternative and clean power applications including hydrogen. For the chemical and petrochemical industries, our equipment is used in fertilizer, ammonia, ethylene, methanol and downstream chemical facilities. 
 Our brands are built upon engineering expertise and close customer collaboration to design, develop, and produce mission critical equipment and systems that enable our customers to meet their economic and operational objectives. Continual improvement of our processes and systems to ensure qualified and compliant equipment are hallmarks of our brand. Our early engagement with customers and support until the end of service life are values upon which our brands are built. 
 Our corporate headquarters is located with our production facilities in Batavia, New York, where surface condensers and ejectors are designed, engineered, and manufactured for the defense, energy, and petrochemical industries. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Barber-Nichols, LLC ("BN"), based in Arvada, Colorado, designs, develops, manufactures and sells specialty turbomachinery products for the space, aerospace, cryogenic, defense, and energy markets. In November 2023, we acquired P3 Technologies, LLC ("P3"), located in Jupiter, Florida (See "Acquisition" below). We also have wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, Graham Vacuum and Heat Transfer Technology Co., Ltd. ("GVHTT"), located in Suzhou, China and Graham India Private Limited ("GIPL"), located in Ahmedabad, India. GVHTT provides sales and engineering support for us throughout Southeast Asia. GIPL provides sales and engineering support for us in India and the Middle East. 
 Our fiscal year ends on March 31 of each year. We refer to our fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2025, as fiscal 2025. Likewise, we refer to our fiscal year that ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 as fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. 
 Acquisition 
 On November 9, 2023, we completed our acquisition of P3, a privately-owned custom turbomachinery engineering, product development, and manufacturing business located in Jupiter, Florida that serves the space, new energy, defense, and medical industries. We believe this acquisition advances our growth strategy, further diversifies our market and product offerings, and broadens our turbomachinery solutions. P3 will be managed through BN and is highly complementary to BN's technology and enhances its turbomachinery solutions. 
 The purchase price for P3 was 11,238 and was comprised of 125 shares of our common stock, representing a value of 1,930, and cash consideration of 7,268. The cash consideration was funded through borrowings on our line of credit. The purchase agreement included a contingent earn-out dependent upon certain financial measures of P3 post-acquisition, in which the sellers are eligible to receive up to 3,000 in additional cash consideration. See Note 2 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the "Form 10-Q") for additional information. 
 Summary 
 Highlights for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include: 
 Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were 53,563, up 8,487, or 19 compared with 45,076 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Incremental revenue from the acquisition of P3 accounted for 859 of this increase. The remainder of this increase was spread across our markets including a 5,779 or 23 increase in sales to the defense industry, primarily due to new programs, growth in existing programs, and timing. Net sales for the quarter for the refining and chemical/petrochemical markets increased 15 and 24 , respectively, driven by increased sales in India and the timing of larger capital projects, partially offset by lower aftermarket sales and sales in China. Aftermarket sales to the refining, chemical/petrochemical, and defense markets of 9.8 million remained strong but were 1.5 million lower than the prior year record levels. 

Gross profit and margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 12,799 and 23.9 , respectively. The 790 basis point improvement in gross profit margin over the comparable period of fiscal 2024 reflected increased leverage on fixed overhead costs due to the higher volume of sales discussed above, as well as an improved mix of sales related to higher margin projects, better execution, and improved pricing. Additionally, second quarter fiscal 2025 gross profit benefited 435 due to a 2,100 grant received from the BlueForge Alliance to reimburse us for the cost of our defense welder training programs 

19 

in Batavia and related equipment. To date we have received 1,098 of funding under this grant. The BlueForge Alliance is a nonprofit, neutral integrator that supports the United States ("U.S.") Navy's Submarine Industrial Base Initiatives. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A"), including intangible amortization, for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 2,772 over the same period of fiscal 2024 and reflects the investments we are making in our operations, our employees, and our technology. In connection with the acquisition of BN, we entered into a Performance Bonus Agreement to provide employees of BN with a supplemental performance-based award based on the achievement of BN performance objectives for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2024, 2025, and 2026, which can range between 2,000 to 4,000 per year (the "BN Performance Bonus). During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we recorded 1,076 related to the BN Performance Bonus, a 274 increase over the prior year. The remainder of the increase in SG A is primarily due to costs related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system at our Batavia facility and additional costs related to P3, as well as increased professional services fees, research and development investment, and personnel costs in connection with our growth and strategic initiatives. 

Net income and income per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were 3,281 and 0.30, respectively, compared with net income and income per diluted share of 411 and 0.04, respectively, for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were 3,414 and 0.31, respectively, compared with adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share of 754 and 0.07, respectively, for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. See "Non-GAAP Measures" below for a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the comparable GAAP amount. 

Orders booked in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased to 63,678 compared with 36,464 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This increase was primarily in the defense and space markets and included an order received to provide the cryogenic pumps for a space launch vehicle and contract to provide the MK19 Air Turbine Pump for the U.S. Navy Columbia-class submarine, which is a new program for the Company. Additionally, after-market orders for the refining and petrochemical markets for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increase 11 to 12,741 compared with the prior-year period. For more information on this key performance indicator see "Orders and Backlog" below. 

Backlog was 407,009 at September 30, 2024, compared with 390,868 and 313,343 at March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. This increase was primarily driven by growth in our chemical/petrochemical and space markets. For more information on this key performance indicator see "Orders and Backlog" below. 

Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were 32,318, compared with 16,939 at March 31, 2024. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 22,649, partially offset by capital expenditures of 6,464 as we continue to invest in process improvement and longer-term growth opportunities. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was primarily driven by cash net income and a reduction in working capital as a result of strong cash management and favorable contract terms.

Current Market Conditions 
 Demand for our equipment and systems for the defense industry is expected to remain strong and continue to expand, based on defense budget plans, accelerated ship build schedules, increased geopolitical tensions, the projected build schedule of submarines, aircraft carriers and undersea propulsion and power systems and the solutions we provide. In addition to U.S. Navy applications, we also provide specialty pumps, turbines, compressors, and controllers for various fluid and thermal management systems used in U.S. Department of Defense radar, laser, electronics, and power systems. We have built a leading position, and in most instances a sole source position, for certain systems and equipment for the defense industry. 
 Our traditional energy markets are undergoing significant transition. While we expect that fossil fuels will continue to be an important component in the global energy industry for many years to come, there are significant changes in the priorities for capital investments by our customers and the regions in which those investments are being made. We expect that the systemic changes in the energy markets, which are influenced by the increasing use by consumers of alternative fuels and government policies to stimulate their usage, will lead to demand growth for fossil-based fuels that is less than the global growth rate. The timing and catalyst for a recovery in this market remain uncertain. Accordingly, we believe that in the near term the quantity of projects available for us to compete for will remain low and that new project pricing will remain challenging. Additionally, we believe that the majority of new capital investment orders in our traditional energy markets will be outside the U.S. such as India and the Middle-East. Finally, over the last few years we have experienced an increase in our energy and chemical aftermarket orders primarily from the domestic market as our customers continue to maintain and invest in the facilities they currently operate. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. 
 Over the long-term, we expect that population growth, an expanding global middle class, and an increasing desire for improved quality of life and access to consumer products will drive increased demand for industrial goods within the plastics and resins value chain along with fertilizers and related products. As such, we expect investment in new global chemical and petrochemical capacity will improve and drive growth in demand for our products and services. 
 We intend to stay competitive in our traditional energy and chemical/petrochemical markets by investing in technology such as our NextGen steam ejector nozzle, which has been engineered to reduce steam consumption, lower operating costs, and increase system capacity, allowing refineries and process plants to enhance throughput while minimizing their carbon footprint. We estimate that the total market opportunity for our NextGen nozzle exceeds 50 million over the next 5 to 10 years. 
 Our turbomachinery, pumps, and cryogenic products and market access provide revenue and growth potential in the commercial space/aerospace markets. The commercial space market has grown and evolved rapidly, and we provide rocket engine turbopump systems and components to many of the launch providers for satellites. We expect that in the long-term, extended space exploration will become more prevalent, and we anticipate that our thermal/fluid management and environmental control and life support system turbomachinery will play important roles. We are also participating in future aerospace power and propulsion system development through supply of fluid and thermal management systems components. Small power dense systems are imperative for these applications, and we believe our technology and expertise will enable us to achieve sales growth in this market. Sales and orders to the space industry are variable in nature and many of our customers, who are key players in the industry, have yet to achieve profitability and may be unable to continue operations without additional funding. As a result, future revenue and growth to this market can be uncertain and may negatively impact our business. 
 The alternative and clean energy opportunities for our heat transfer, power production and fluid transfer systems are expected to continue to grow. We assist in designing, developing and producing equipment for hydrogen production, distribution and fueling systems, concentrated solar power and storage, small modular nuclear systems, bioenergy products, and geothermal power generation with lithium extraction. We are positioning the Company to be a more significant contributor as these markets continue to develop. 
 As illustrated below, we have succeeded over the last several years with our strategy to increase our participation in the defense market, which comprised 83 of our total backlog at September 30, 2024.

The following tables provide our net sales by product line and geographic region including the percentage of total and change in comparison to the prior year for each category and period presented. Percentages may not sum to the total due to rounding: 
 
 Second Quarter and First Six Months of Fiscal 2025 Compared with Second Quarter and First Six Months of Fiscal 2024 
 Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 8,487, or 19 , compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Incremental revenue from the acquisition of P3 accounted for 859 of this increase. The remainder of this increase was spread across our markets including a 5,779, or 23 , increase in sales to the defense industry, primarily due to new programs, growth in existing programs, and timing. Net sales for the quarter for the refining and chemical/petrochemical markets increased 15 and 24 , 
 22 

respectively, driven by increased sales in India and the timing of larger capital projects, partially offset by lower aftermarket sales and sales in China. Aftermarket sales to the refining, chemical/petrochemical, and defense markets of 9.8 million remained strong but were 1.5 million lower than the prior year record levels. 
 Domestic sales as a percentage of aggregate sales were 85 in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, comparable to the 86 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, reflecting our continued presence in the defense industry, which is U.S. based. Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 58 to the defense industry compared to 56 for the comparable quarter in fiscal 2024. 
 Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased 10,869, or 12 , from the first six months of fiscal 2024. Approximately 2,437 of this increase was due to the acquisition of P3. Additionally, the increase over the prior year was due to a 12,056, or 28 , increase in sales to the defense industry, primarily due to better execution, improved pricing, new programs, growth in existing programs, and increased direct labor. Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 to the refining market increased 18 , driven by increased sales in India and the timing of larger capital projects, partially offset by lower aftermarket sales and sales in China. Aftermarket sales to the refining, chemical/petrochemical, and defense markets of 17,610 remained strong but were 4,553 lower than the prior year record levels. These increases were partially offset by a 3,254 decrease in "Other" sales due to project timing across multiple markets and customers. 
 Domestic sales as a percentage of aggregate sales were 83 for the first six months of fiscal 2025, comparable to the same period of fiscal 2024, reflecting our continued presence in the defense industry, which is U.S. based. Sales for the six months ended September 30, 2024 were 58 to the defense industry compared to 52 for the comparable quarter in fiscal 2024. Fluctuation in sales among markets, products and geographic locations varies, sometimes significantly, from quarter-to-quarter based on timing and magnitude of projects. See also "Current Market Conditions," above. For additional information on anticipated future sales and our markets, see "Orders and Backlog" below. 
 Gross profit and margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 12,799 and 23.9 , respectively. Gross profit and margin for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 25,167 and 24.3 , respectively. These 790 and 470 basis point improvements in gross profit margin over the comparable quarter and year-to-date periods of fiscal 2024, respectively, reflected increased leverage on fixed overhead costs due to the higher volume of sales discussed above, as well as an improved mix of sales related to higher margin projects, better execution, and improved pricing, partially offset by higher incentive compensation in comparison with the prior year. Additionally, second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2025 gross profit benefited 435 and 915, respectively, from a 2,100 grant received from the BlueForge Alliance to reimburse us for the cost of our defense welder training programs in Batavia and related equipment. To date we have received 1,098 of funding under this grant. 
 Changes in SG A expense, including amortization expense, for the three and six months ending September 30, 2024 versus the comparable prior year period is as follows:

In connection with the acquisition of BN, we entered into a Performance Bonus Agreement to provide employees of BN with a supplemental performance-based award based on the achievement of BN performance objectives for fiscal years ending March 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, which can range between 2,000 and 4,000 per year. The increase in research and development costs reflects the increased level of investment we are making in our products and technology. The increase in ERP implementation costs related to the new ERP system at our Batavia facility. In addition to the above, P3 added 371 and 720 to SG A expense for the quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 versus the prior year, respectively, which includes amortization of customer relationship and tradename intangibles. Other increases to SG A include increases due to normal merit increases as well as increased staffing to support our growth. 
 Other operating income represents the change in fair value of the P3 contingent earn-out liability and was 596 and 726 for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus 0 for the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2024. 
 23 

Net interest income for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 was 153 and 314, respectively, compared to net interest expense of 55 and 240 for the comparable periods of fiscal 2024, respectively. This increase in interest income was due to our strong cash position and lower debt levels versus fiscal 2024. 
 Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 24 , compared with 37 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Our effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 18 , compared with 25 for the first six months of fiscal 2024. Our effective tax rate can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the level of projected pre-tax income, the amount of projected income derived from our higher tax rate foreign subsidiaries, as well as the timing of discrete tax items, primarily related to the vesting of restricted stock awards. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a discrete benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and the Company's improved stock price over the last year. Additionally, the first six months of fiscal 2025 effective tax rate benefited from a higher mix of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2025, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 20 and 22 , as the impact of these discrete tax items on our full year effective tax rate lessens over the course of the year. 
 The result of the above is that net income and income per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were 3,281 and 0.30, respectively, compared with 411 and 0.04, respectively, for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were 3,414 and 0.31, respectively, compared with net income of 754 and 0.07, respectively, for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. See "Non-GAAP Measures" below for a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the comparable GAAP amount. 
 Net income and income per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal 2025 were 6,247 and 0.57, respectively, compared with net income of 3,051 and 0.28, respectively, for the first six months of fiscal 2024. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal 2025 were 6,999 and 0.64, respectively, compared with net income of 3,737 and 0.35, respectively, for the first six months of fiscal 2024. See "Non-GAAP Measures" below for a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the comparable GAAP amount. 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 Adjusted net income before interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), adjusted net income, and adjusted net income per diluted share are provided for informational purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). 
 Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating the operating results of the Company. In particular, those charges and credits that are not directly related to our operating performance, and are not reflective of our underlying business particularly in light of their unpredictable nature. These non-GAAP disclosures have limitations as analytical tools, should not be viewed as a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. In addition, supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to net income or net income per diluted share determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are key metrics used by management and our board of directors to assess the Company s financial and operating performance and adjusted EBITDA is a basis for a significant portion of management's performance-based compensation. 
 Adjusted EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization, interest (income) expense, income taxes, acquisition related (income) expenses, equity-based compensation, ERP implementation costs, and other unusual/nonrecurring items. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share exclude intangible amortization, acquisition related (income) expenses, other unusual/nonrecurring items, and the related tax impacts of those adjustments. 
 A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to net income in accordance with GAAP is as follows:

(2) Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, adjusted net income no longer excludes the BN Performance Bonus. Prior period results have been adjusted to reflect this change on a comparable basis. The BN Performance Bonus expense, net-of-tax, was 829 and 1,657 for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, and 618 and 1,208 for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, respectively, and will be completed at the end of fiscal year 2026. 

Acquisition and integration (income) costs are incremental costs that are directly related to and as a result of the P3 acquisition. These costs (income) may include, among other things, professional, consulting and other fees, system integration costs, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments. ERP implementation costs primarily relate to consulting costs (training, data conversion, and 
 25 

project management) incurred in connection with the ERP system being implemented throughout our Batavia, New York facility in order to enhance efficiency and productivity and are not expected to recur once the project is completed. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

Working capital ratio (1)

(1) Working capital equals current assets minus current liabilities. Working capital ratio equals current assets divided by current liabilities. 

Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 22,649 compared with 11,898 for the first six months of fiscal 2024. This increase was primarily a result of higher cash net income and a reduction in working capital. Over the last year, cash flow from operations benefited approximately 21,000 from customer deposits, net of unbilled revenue, primarily from long-term U.S. Navy defense contracts/projects, that will require cash expenditures over the next 12 to 24 months, which could reduce cash flows from operations. 
 Capital expenditures for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 6,464 compared to 3,312 for the comparable period in fiscal 2024. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 were primarily for machinery and equipment, as well as for buildings and leasehold improvements to support our growth and productivity improvement initiatives and included expenditures related to the expansion of defense production capabilities at our Batavia facility, which is primarily being funded by a 13,500 strategic grant from one of our defense customers. We have increased our expected fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of 13,000 to 18,000 from our previous expectations of 10,000 to 15,000 due to a land purchase in Arvada, Colorado and plans to build a cryogenic propellant (LH2, LOX, LCH4) testing facility in Florida to support future growth and customer needs. Approximately half of our planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 are discretionary, with the other half being related to the Batavia facility defense expansion. We estimate that our maintenance capital spend is approximately 2,000 per year. However, for the next several years we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 7 to 10 of sales as we continue to invest in our business in order to support our long-term organic growth goals. 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 32,318 at September 30, 2024 compared with 16,939 at March 31, 2024, up 15,379 primarily due to cash provided by operations, offset by capital expenditures. At September 30, 2024, 4,890 of our cash and cash equivalents was used to secure our letters of credit and 3,816 of our cash was held by foreign subsidiaries. 
 On October 13, 2023, we terminated our revolving credit facility and repaid our term loan with Bank of America, and entered into a new five-year revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo that provides a 35,000 line of credit that automatically increases to 50,000 upon the Company satisfying specified covenants, which were satisfied during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (the "New Revolving Credit Facility"). As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings and 6,847 letters of credit outstanding on the New Revolving Credit Facility and the amount available to borrow was 43,152, subject to interest and leverage covenants. 
 The New Revolving Credit Facility contains customary terms and conditions, including representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants for the benefit of Wells Fargo, which require us to maintain (i) a consolidated total leverage ratio not to exceed 3.50:1.00 and (ii) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.20:1.00, in both cases computed in accordance with the definitions and requirements specified in the New Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the New Revolving Credit Facility and our leverage ratio as calculated in accordance with the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility was 0.6x. 
 The New Revolving Credit Facility contains terms that may, under certain circumstances as defined in the agreement, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends. Any determination by our Board of Directors regarding dividends in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our future financial performance, organic and inorganic growth opportunities, general economic conditions, and financial, competitive, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We did not pay any dividends during the six months ended September 30, 2024, or during fiscal 2024 and currently have no intention to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 
 We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, other than letters of credit incurred in the ordinary course of business. 
 We believe that cash generated from operations combined with the liquidity provided by our New Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate to meet our cash needs for the immediate future.

Orders and Backlog 
 In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, management uses the following key performance metrics to analyze and measure our financial performance and results of operations: orders, backlog, and book-to-bill ratio. Management uses orders and backlog as measures of current and future business and financial performance and these may not be comparable with measures provided by other companies. Orders represent written communications received from customers requesting us to provide products and/or services. Backlog is defined as the total dollar value of net orders received for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Management believes tracking orders and backlog are useful as it often times is a leading indicator of future performance. In accordance with industry practice, contracts may include provisions for cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the customer. 
 The book-to-bill ratio is an operational measure that management uses to track the growth prospects of the Company. The Company calculates the book-to-bill ratio for a given period as net orders divided by net sales. 
 Given that each of orders, backlog, and book-to-bill ratio is an operational measure and that the Company's methodology for calculating orders, backlog and book-to-bill ratio does not meet the definition of a non-GAAP measure, as that term is defined by the SEC, a quantitative reconciliation for each is not required or provided. 
 
 The following tables provides our orders by market and geographic region including the percentage of total orders and change in comparison to the prior year for each category and period presented. Percentages may not sum to the total due to rounding: 

Orders booked in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were 63,678 or 1.2x net sales for the quarter. Orders booked for the six-month were 119,445 or 1.2x net sales for the period. As a result, backlog increased 10,234 (3 during the quarter and 16,141 (4 for the first six month of fiscal 2025 to 407,009 at September 30, 2024. Orders for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 benefited from a contract to provide the cryogenic pumps for a space launch vehicle and contract to provide the MK19 Air Turbine Pump for the U.S. Navy Columbia-class submarine, which is a new program for the Company. In addition to the above, orders for the first six months of fiscal 2025 included follow-on orders for the second option year of alternators and regulators for the U.S. Navy MK48 Torpedo program, as well as an order for three surface condenser systems for the world's first net-zero carbon emissions integrated ethylene cracker and derivatives site located in North America. Additionally, after-market orders for the refining and petrochemical markets for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 were approximately 12,741 and 20,953, respectively, representing an 11 and 8 increase over the prior-year, respectively. Orders for the first six months of fiscal 2024 included 22,000 related to a strategic investment and follow-on orders from a major defense customer and 9,100 for a vacuum distillation system for a refinery in India. 
 Orders to the U.S. represented 74 of total orders for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 81 for the prior year. These orders were primarily to the defense market which are U.S. based. 
 The following table provides our backlog by market, including the percentage of total backlog, for each category and period presented. Percentages may not sum to the total due to rounding:

We expect to recognize revenue on approximately 35 to 45 of the backlog within one year, 30 to 40 in one to two years and the remaining beyond two years. The majority of the orders that are expected to convert beyond twenty-four months are for the defense industry, specifically the U.S. Navy that have a long conversion cycle (up to six years).

See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statement" and "Non-GAAP Measures" above for additional information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. We have not reconciled non-GAAP forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as permitted by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. Such reconciliation would require unreasonable efforts to estimate and quantify various necessary GAAP components largely because forecasting or predicting our future operating results is subject to many factors out of our control or not readily predictable. 
 We have made significant progress with the advancements in our business, which puts us on schedule in achieving our fiscal 2027 goals of 8 to 10 average annualized organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margins in the low to mid-teens. 
 Our expectations for sales and profitability assume that we will be able to operate our production facilities at planned capacity, have access to our global supply chain including our subcontractors, do not experience significant global health related disruptions, and assumes no further impact from any other unforeseen events. 
 Contingencies and Commitments 
 We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos allegedly contained in or accompanying our products or from exposure to asbestos at the Company's facilities. We are a co-defendant with numerous other defendants in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. The claims in most of our current lawsuits are similar to those made in previous asbestos lawsuits that named us as a defendant. Such previous lawsuits either were dismissed when it was shown that we had not supplied products to the plaintiffs places of work, or were settled by us for immaterial amounts. We believe that the resolution of these asbestos-related lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these asbestos-related lawsuits could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, with the assistance of external counsel and forensic professionals, concluded an investigation into a whistleblower complaint received regarding GIPL. The investigation identified evidence supporting the complaint and other misconduct by employees. The other misconduct total 150 over a period of four years and was isolated to GIPL. All involved employees have been terminated and we have implemented remedial actions, including strengthening our compliance program and internal controls. As a result of the investigation, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the statutory auditor and bookkeeper of GIPL tendered their resignations and new firms were appointed. We have voluntarily reported the findings of our investigation to the appropriate authorities in India and the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC. Although the resolutions of 
 28 

these matters are inherently uncertain, we do not believe any remaining impact will be material to our overall consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we are subject to the claims noted above, as well as other legal proceedings and potential claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of the lawsuits, legal proceedings or potential claims to which we are or may become a party cannot be determined and an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be made for the majority of the claims, we do not believe that the outcomes, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. See Note 10 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments 
 Our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the selection of accounting policies and the application of significant accounting estimates, some of which require management to make significant assumptions. We believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements relate to labor hour estimates, total cost, and establishment of operational milestones which are used to recognize revenue over time, accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, accounting for business combinations and intangible assets, and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits. There have been no material changes to the aforementioned critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information, refer to Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 In the normal course of business, management evaluates all new Accounting Standards Updates and other accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, SEC, or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Other than those discussed in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, management does not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements, which have not already been adopted, to have a material impact on the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of the newly issued accounting pronouncements see Note 14 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from market changes) to which we are exposed are foreign currency exchange rates, price risk, and interest rate risk. 
 The assumptions applied in preparing the following qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding foreign currency exchange rate, price risk and interest rate risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced by us in relevant historical periods, our current knowledge of the marketplace, and our judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the markets in which we operate. 
 Foreign Currency 
 International consolidated sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 were 18 of total sales. Operating in markets throughout the world exposes us to movements in currency exchange rates. Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies. Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified. In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. In the first six months of fiscal 2025, substantially all sales by us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, for which we were paid, were denominated in the local currency of the respective subsidiary (U.S. dollars, Chinese RMB or India INR). For the first six months of fiscal 2025, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our cash balances by 41 primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. 
 We have limited exposure to foreign currency purchases. In the first six months of fiscal 2025, our purchases in foreign currencies represented approximately 6 of the cost of products sold. At certain times, we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange rate agreements to hedge our exposure against potential unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales and purchase contracts negotiated in foreign currencies. Forward foreign currency exchange rate contracts were not used in the periods being reported in this Form 10-Q and as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we held no forward foreign currency contracts. 
 Price Risk 
 Operating in a global market place requires us to compete with other global manufacturers which, in some instances, benefit from lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions. Although we believe that our customers differentiate our products on the basis of our manufacturing quality, engineering experience, and customer service, among other things, such lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions mean that our competitors are able to offer products similar to ours at lower prices. In extreme 
 29 

market downturns, we typically see depressed price levels. Additionally, we have faced, and may continue to face, significant cost inflation, specifically in labor costs, raw materials, and other supply chain costs due to increased demand for raw materials and resources caused by the broad disruption of the global supply chain. International conflicts or other geopolitical events, including the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, may further contribute to increased supply chain costs due to shortages in raw materials, increased costs for transportation and energy, disruptions in supply chains, and heightened inflation. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions may also lead to changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chain, and consequently our results of operations. While there could ultimately be a material impact on our operations and liquidity, at the time of this report, the impact could not be determined. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 In order to fund our strategic growth objectives, including acquisitions, from time to time we may borrow funds under our New Revolving Credit Facility that bears interest at a variable rate. As part of our risk management activities, we evaluate the use of interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. As of September 30, 2024, we had no variable rate debt outstanding on our New Revolving Credit Facility and no interest rate derivatives outstanding. See "Debt" in Note 13 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about our outstanding debt. 
 Item 4. Control s and Procedures 
 Conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Our President and Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Vice President - Finance and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer) each have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, and as of such date, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President - Finance and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in all material respects. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 Other than the events discussed under the section entitled "P3 Technologies, LLC Acquisition" below, there has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter covered by this Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 P3 Technologies, LLC Acquisition 
 On November 9, 2023, we acquired P3, a privately-owned custom turbomachinery engineering, product development, and manufacturing business that serves the space, new energy, defense, and medical industries. For additional information regarding the acquisition, refer to Note 2 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-Q and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part I, Item 2 in this Form 10-Q. Based on the recent completion of this acquisition and, pursuant to the SEC's guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of an assessment for a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report does not include P3. 
 We are in the process of implementing our internal control structure over P3 and we expect that this effort will be completed during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.

Dividend Policy 
 Our revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo contains terms that may, under certain circumstances as defined in the agreement, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends. Any determination by our Board of Directors regarding dividends in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our future financial performance, organic and inorganic growth opportunities, general economic conditions and financial, competitive, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We did not pay any dividends during the six months ended September 30, 2024 or during fiscal 2024 and we currently have no intention to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.

EXHIBIT 31.1 
 CERTIFICATION OF 
 PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
 On November 9, 2023, Graham Corporation acquired P3 Technologies, LLC. Management has excluded this acquisition from its internal assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 I, Daniel J. Thoren, certify that: 
 1. I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Graham Corporation; 

2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;
