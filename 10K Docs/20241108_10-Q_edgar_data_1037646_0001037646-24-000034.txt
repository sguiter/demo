The Company's product revenue by reportable segment is proportionately similar to the Company's global mix except the Company's Swiss Operations is largely comprised of laboratory products while the Company's Chinese Operations has a slightly higher percentage of industrial products.

 The payment terms in the Company s contracts with customers do not exceed one year and therefore contracts do not contain a significant financing component. In most cases, after appropriate credit evaluations, payments are due in arrears and are recognized as receivables. Unbilled revenue is recorded when performance obligations have been satisfied, but not yet billed to the customer. Unbilled revenue as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively, and is included within accounts receivable. Deferred revenue and customer prepayments are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of the performance obligation being satisfied. Deferred revenue primarily includes prepaid service contracts, as well as deferred installation. 
 Changes in the components of deferred revenue and customer prepayments during the nine month periods ending September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: 
 Customer pre-payments/deferred revenue Revenue recognized ) ) Foreign currency translation ) Ending balance as of September 30 
 The Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the contract period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses. The value of unsatisfied performance obligations other than customer prepayments and deferred revenue associated with contracts greater than one year is immaterial.

 4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. The Company enters into certain interest rate and cross currency swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. The amount of the Company's fixed obligation interest payments may change based upon the expiration dates of its interest rate and cross currency swap agreements and the level and composition of its debt. The Company also enters into certain foreign currency forward contracts to limit the Company's exposure to currency fluctuations on the respective hedged items. For additional disclosures on derivative instruments regarding balance sheet location, fair value, and the amounts reclassified into other comprehensive income and the effective portion of the cash flow hedges, also see Note 5 and Note 9 to the interim consolidated financial statements. As also described in Note 7, the Company has designated its euro-denominated debt as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in euro-denominated foreign subsidiaries. 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 The Company has entered into a number of cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges. The agreements convert borrowings under the Company s credit facility into synthetic Swiss franc debt, which allows the Company to effectively change the floating rate SOFR-based interest payments, excluding the credit spread, to a fixed Swiss franc income or expense as follows: 
 Agreement Date Amount Converted Effective Swiss Franc Interest Rate Maturity Date June 2019 50 million (0.82) June 2023 November 2021 50 million (0.67) November 2023 June 2021 50 million (0.73) June 2024 June 2021 50 million (0.59) June 2025 December 2023 50 million 1.04 November 2026 November 2023 50 million 1.16 November 2026 June 2023 50 million 1.55 June 2027 June 2024 50 million 1.15 June 2027 
 In June 2024, the Company entered into a cross currency swap arrangement, as summarized above, to replace the cross currency swap that matured in June 2024. The new swap was designated as an effective cash flow hedge. 
 The Company amended all active cross currency swap agreements to replace all references of LIBOR to SOFR as the interest rate benchmark to align with the amendment to the Company's Prior Credit Facility Agreement, as discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. As part of these amendments, the corresponding fixed Swiss franc interest rates were amended as well to reflect the change in the benchmark. 
 The Company's cash flow hedges are recorded gross at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. A derivative gain of million based upon interest rates at September 30, 2024, is expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the next twelve months. The cash flow hedges remain effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Other Derivatives 
 The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts in order to economically hedge short-term trade and non-trade intercompany balances largely denominated in Swiss franc, other major

 European currencies, and the Chinese Renminbi with its foreign businesses. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these contracts are con sidered derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Gains or losses on these instruments are reported in current earnings. The foreign currency forward contracts are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as disclosed in Note 5. The Company recognized in other charges (income) a net loss of million and net loss of million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a net gain of million and net loss of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which offset the related transaction gains (losses) associated with these contracts. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these c ontracts had a notional value of million and million, respectively. 
 
 5. 
 million and million respectively, and derivative liabilities totaling million and million, respectively. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and therefore does not present all the required disclosures in tabular format. The fair values of the cross currency swap agreements and foreign currency forward contracts that economically hedge short-term intercompany balances are estimated based upon inputs from current valuation information obtained from dealer quotes and priced with observable market assumptions and appropriate valuation adjustments for credit risk. The Company has evaluated the valuation methodologies used to develop the fair values by dealers in order to determine whether such valuations are representative of an exit price in the Company s principal market. In addition, the Company uses an internally developed model to perform testing on the valuations received from brokers. The Company has also considered both its own credit risk and counterparty credit risk in determining fair value and determined these adjustments were insignificant at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement consists of observable and unobservable inputs that reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
 
 A fair value hierarchy has been established that categorizes these inputs into three levels: 
 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
 Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs

 The Company had million and million of cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the fair value of which is determined using Level 2 inputs, through quoted and corroborated prices in active markets. The fair value of cash equivalents approximates cost. 
 The fair value of the Company's debt is less than the carrying value by approximately million as of September 30, 2024. The fair value of the Company's fixed interest rate debt was estimated using Level 2 inputs, primarily discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 10.0 million of contingent consideration was paid relating to the PendoTECH acquisition of which 5.6 million is included in financing activities for the amount accrued at the acquisition date and 4.4 million is included in operating activities for the amount not accrued at the acquisition date on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company no longer has a contingent consideration obligation relating to the PendoTECH acquisition as of September 30, 2024.

 and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for taxes is based upon using the Company's projected annual effective tax rate of before non-recurring discrete tax items during 2024 and 2023. The difference between the Company's projected annual effective tax rate and the reported tax rate for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to a non-cash discrete tax benefit of 23 million resulting from the reduction of uncertain tax position liabilities related to the settlement of a tax audit. The reported tax rate for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 is also impacted by the timing of excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises.

 On May 30, 2024, the Company entered into a 1.35 billion Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), which amended its 1.25 billion Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement). As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million of additional borrowings available under its Credit Agreement, a nd the Company maintained million of cash and cash equivalents. 
 The Credit Agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions (similar to the Company's Prior Credit Agreement) and has a maturity date of 2029. It is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio. The Company must also pay facility fees that are tied to its leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that are similar to those contained in the prior Credit Agreement, with which the Company was in compliance as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company is required to maintain (i) a ratio of net funded indebtedness to EBITDA of 3.5 to 1.0 or less, except in certain circumstances and (ii) an interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 or greater. The Credit Agreement also places certain limitations on the Company, including limiting the ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level. In addition, the Credit Agreement has several events of default,

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. 
 General 
 Our interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. 
 Changes in local currency exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates. We believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods. We do not, nor do we suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We present non-GAAP financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results. 
 We also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified. Although the impact of such factors is not considered material, we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results. 
 Results of Operations Consolidated 
 The following tables set forth certain items from our interim consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (amounts in thousands). 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) Net sales 954,535 100.0 942,462 100.0 2,827,234 100.0 2,853,317 100.0 Cost of sales 382,068 40.0 382,923 40.6 1,140,966 40.4 1,163,669 40.8 Gross profit 572,467 60.0 559,539 59.4 1,686,268 59.6 1,689,648 59.2 Research and development 47,117 4.9 46,127 4.9 139,303 4.9 138,849 4.9 Selling, general and administrative 228,777 24.0 217,447 23.1 698,963 24.7 680,679 23.9 Amortization 18,243 1.9 18,314 1.9 54,649 1.9 54,135 1.9 Interest expense 18,599 1.9 20,278 2.2 56,781 2.0 57,711 2.0 Restructuring charges 2,631 0.3 7,385 0.8 17,624 0.6 19,680 0.7 Other charges (income), net (1,852) (0.2) (1,171) (0.1) (3,728) (0.1) (2,578) (0.2) Earnings before taxes 258,952 27.2 251,159 26.6 722,676 25.6 741,172 26.0 Provision for taxes 47,436 5.0 49,528 5.2 111,837 4.0 137,188 4.8 Net earnings 211,516 22.2 201,631 21.4 610,839 21.6 603,984 21.2 
 
 Net sales 
 Net sale s were 954.5 million and 942.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and 2.8 billion and 2.9 billion for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sales in U.S. dollars increased 1 for the three month period and decreased 1 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations, or in local currencies, net sales increased 1 for the three month period and were flat for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. We estimate that 
 - 25 - 

Table of Contents 

 net sales for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 benefited by approximately 2 from the recovery of our previously disclosed shipping delays in 2023 related to a new external European logistics service provider. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 we continued to experience soft market demand, particularly in China. We also continue to benefit from the execution of our global sales and marketing programs and our innovative product portfolio. However, there is uncertainty in the economic environment and our end markets, including the risk of recession in many countries, and market conditions may change quickly. The ongoing developments related to Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, and inflation also present several risks to our business as further described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These topics could adversely impact our financial results and could have a greater impact on our operating results in future periods. 
 Net sales by geographic destination for the three months ended September 30, 2024 in U.S. dollars increased 2 in Europe and 4 in Asia/Rest of World, and decreased 1 in the Americas. In local currencies, our net sales by geographic destination increased 1 in Europe and 4 in Asia/Rest of World, and decreased 1 in the Americas. Our net sales by geographic destination for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in U.S. dollars increased 5 in Europe and 1 in the Americas, and decreased 8 in Asia/Rest of World. Net sales by geographic destination for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in local currencies increased 4 in Europe and 1 in the Americas, and decreased 6 in Asia/Rest of World. Net sales in Asia/Rest of World in local currency includes an increase of 1 and a decrease of 15 in China during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Excluding the benefit of delayed fourth quarter 2023 shipments, local currency sales were flat in Europe and the Americas, and decreased 7 in Asia/Rest of World, with a 15 decline in China, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. A discussion of sales by operating segment is included below. 
 As described in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services. Service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services, including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration, certification, preventative maintenance and spare parts. 
 Net sales of products decreased 1 in both U.S. dollars and local currencies for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased 3 in U.S. dollars and 2 in local currencies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Service revenue (including spare parts) increased 9 in both U.S. dollars and local currencies for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased 7 in both U.S. dollars and local currencies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Net sales of our laboratory products and services, which represented approximately 56 of our total net sales, increased 5 in both U.S. dollars and local currencies for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased 2 in both U.S. dollars and local currencies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Laboratory net sales benefited approximately 3 from the previously disclosed shipping delays during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. The increase in local currency net sales for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 reflects growth in most product categories, especially analytical instruments and process analytics. Laboratory results for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 were also negatively impacted by a significant decline in China. 
 
 Net sales of our industrial products and services, which represented approximately 39 of our total net sales, were flat in both U.S. dollars and local currencies for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 3 in U.S. dollars and 2 in local currencies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Industrial net sales benefited approximately 1 from the previously disclosed shipping delays during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The local 
 - 26 - 

Table of Contents 

 currency net sales of our industrial-related products for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 includes growth in product inspection, offset by a modest decline in core-industrial products. 
 
 Net sales in our food retailing products and services, which represented approximately 5 of our total net sales, decreased 20 in both U.S. dollars and local currencies for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 14 in both U.S. dollars and local currencies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Retail net sales benefited approximately 2 from the previously disclosed shipping delays during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The local currency net sales decrease in food retailing products during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the especially strong project related growth in the prior year. 
 Gross profit 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 60.0 and 59.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 59.6 and 59.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 61.8 and 61.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 61.7 and 60.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services (including spare parts) was 54.4 and 53.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 53.4 and 54.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects favorable price realization and business mix, offset in part by investments in our service organization. 
 Research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was 4.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Research and development expenses increased 2 in U.S. dollars and 1 in local currencies for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and was flat in U.S. dollars and in local currencies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 24.0 and 23.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were 24.7 and 23.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5 in both U.S. dollars and local currencies for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased 3 in both U.S. dollars and local currencies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increase includes higher variable compensation costs, offset in part by benefits from our cost savings initiatives. 
 Amortization, interest expense, restructuring charges, other charges (income), net and taxes 
 Amortization expense was 18.2 million and 18.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 54.6 million and 54.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Interest expense was 18.6 million and 20.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 56.8 million and 57.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents 

 Restructuring charges were 2.6 million and 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 17.6 million and 19.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Restructuring expenses are primarily comprised of employee-related costs. 
 Other charges (income), net includes non-service pension costs (benefits), net (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions and hedging activities, interest income and other items. Non-service pension benefits were 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 5.7 million and 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Our reported tax rate was 18.3 and 19.7 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 15.5 and 18.5 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The reported tax rate for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 includes a non-cash discrete tax benefit of 23 million resulting from the reduction of uncertain tax position liabilities related to the settlement of a tax audit. The provision for taxes is based upon using our projected annual effective tax rate of 19.0 before non-recurring discrete tax items for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The difference between the Company's projected annual effective tax rate and the reported tax rate for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to a non-cash discrete tax benefit of 23 million resulting from the reduction of uncertain tax position liabilities related to the settlement of a tax audit. The reported tax rate for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 is also impacted by the timing of excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises. 
 Results of Operations by Operating Segment 
 The following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments. We currently have five reportable segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European Operations, Chinese Operations and Other. A more detailed description of these segments is outlined in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Net sales to external customers decreased 1 and increased 1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023. Net sales to external customers benefited by approximately 1 from the previously disclosed shipping delays during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net sales to external customers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect a significant decline in food retailing related to strong project activity in the prior year, offset in part by growth in most other product categories. Net sales to external customers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 also reflect strong growth in process analytics. 
 Segment profit increased 6.7 million and 14.6 million for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Segment profit increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to improved business mix, and benefits from our margin expansion and cost savings initiatives.

 Total net sales increased 4 in U.S. dollars and 3 in local currency for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased 7 in U.S. dollars and 5 in local currency for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Net sales to external customers increased 1 in both U.S. dollars and local currency for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased 17 in U.S. dollars and 15 in local currency during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Net sales benefited by approximately 1 from our previously disclosed shipping delays during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in net sales to external customers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from easier prior year comparisons while market conditions remained soft. Results included growth in laboratory products, offset in part by a decline in industrial products. Net sales to external customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect a significant decline in market demand in most product categories. Uncertainties continue to exist and market conditions may change quickly. 
 Segment profit increased 5.6 million and decreased 20.1 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increase in segment profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 includes increased sales volume and benefits from our margin expansion and cost savings initiatives. The decrease in segment profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects significantly lower sales volumes and unfavorable currency translation.

 segment profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to increased sales volume and our margin expansion initiatives, offset in part by unfavorable foreign currency translation. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In addition, liquidity includes available borrowings under our Credit Agreement, the ability to obtain appropriate financing and our cash and cash equivalent balances. Currently, our liquidity needs are primarily driven by working capital requirements, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions. Global market conditions can be uncertain, and our ability to generate cash flow could be reduced by a deterioration in global markets. 
 We currently believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with liquidity available under our Credit Agreement, local working capital facilities, and cash balances, will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future. 
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled 702.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, co mpared to 684.4 million in the corresponding period in 2023. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to working capital, including lower cash incentive payments of approximately 35 million. 
 Capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology, machinery, equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital expenditures totaled 62.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 72.9 million in the corresponding period in 2023. 
 In September 2021, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to increase domestic production capacity of pipette tips and enhance manufacturing automation and logistics. We have received the maximum allowable funding of 35.8 million related to the agreement during prior years, which offset associated capital expenditures. 
 We continue to explore potential acquisitions. In connection with any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 10.0 million of contingent consideration was paid relating to the PendoTECH acquisition of which 5.6 million is included in financing activities for the amount accrued at the acquisition date and 4.4 million is included in operating activities for the amount not accrued at the acquisition date on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Cash flows used in financing activities are primarily comprised of share repurchases. In accordance with our share repurchase program, we spent 637.5 million and 724.0 million on the repurchase of 482,413 shares and 526,019 shares, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted on August 16, 2022. The IRA includes provisions imposing a 1 excise tax on net share repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022

 and introduces a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income. The financial impact of the IRA was immaterial to our financial statements. 
 Senior Notes and Credit Facility Agreement 
 Our debt consisted of the following at September 30, 2024: 
 U.S. Dollar Other Principal Trading Currencies Total 4.24 125 million ten-year Senior Notes due June 25, 2025 125,000 125,000 3.91 75 million ten-year Senior Notes due June 25, 2029 75,000 75,000 5.45 150 million ten-year Senior Notes due March 1, 2033 150,000 150,000 2.83 125 million twelve-year Senior Notes due July 22, 2033 125,000 125,000 3.19 50 million fifteen-year Senior Notes due January 24, 2035 50,000 50,000 2.81 150 million fifteen-year Senior Note due March 17, 2037 150,000 150,000 2.91 150 million fifteen-year Senior Note due September 1, 2037 150,000 150,000 1.47 Euro 125 million fifteen-year Senior Notes due June 17, 2030 139,461 139,461 1.30 Euro 135 million fifteen-year Senior Notes due November 6, 2034 150,618 150,618 1.06 Euro 125 million fifteen-year Senior Notes due March 19, 2036 139,461 139,461 Debt issuance costs, net (2,400) (1,258) (3,658) Total Senior Notes 822,600 428,282 1,250,882 1.35 billion Credit Agreement, interest at benchmark plus 97.5 basis points (a)

 (a) The benchmark interest rate is determined by the borrowing currency. The benchmark rates by borrowing currency are as follows: SOFR for U.S. dollars (plus a 10 basis points spread adjustment), SARON for Swiss franc, EURIBOR for Euro and SONIA for Great British pounds. 
 
 On May 30, 2024, we entered into a 1.35 billion Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), which amended our 1.25 billion Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement), that is further described in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 585.3 million of additional borrowings available under our Credit Agreement, and we maintained 71.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. 
 In May 2023 we amended our Prior Credit Agreement to replace all references of LIBOR to SOFR and other non-U.S. dollar references as the interest rate benchmark. 
 Changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flows and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity. In addition, because we borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. Further, we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024.

 Other Local Arrangements 
 In April 2018, two of our non-U.S. pension plans issued loans totaling 39.6 million (Swiss franc 38 million) to a wholly owned subsi diary of the Company. The loans have the same terms and conditions which include an interest rate of SARON plus 97.5 basis points. This rate changed from SARON plus 87.5 basis points in August 2024. The loans were renewed for one year in April 2024. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 We have 1.9 billion of remaining availability for our share repurchase program as of September 30, 2024. The share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities, borrowings, and cash balances. Repurchases will be made through open market transactions, and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions, the stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition activity, and other factors. 
 We have purchased 32.2 million shares at an average price per share of 297.53 since the inception of the program in 2004 through September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we spent 637.5 million and 724.0 million on the repurchase of 482,413 and 526,019 shares at an average price per share of 1,321.46 and 1,388.54, respectively. We also reissued 58,909 shares and 70,812 shares held in treasury upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Effect of Currency on Results of Operations 
 Our earnings are affected by changes in exchange rates. We are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the Swiss franc, euro, Chinese renminbi, and U.S. dollar. We have more Swiss franc expenses than we do Swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in Switzerland that we sell globally, and have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland. When the Swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and euro, our earnings decrease. We also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses. When the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc, our earnings also decrease. We estimate a 1 strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 2.3 million to 2.6 million annually. 
 We also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. The most significant of these currency exposures is the Chinese renminbi. The impact on our earnings before tax of the Chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the U.S. dollar is a reduction of approximately 2.5 million to 2.8 million annually. 
 In addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc and the euro. Based on our outstanding debt at September 30, 2024, we estimate that a 5 weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 42.6 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of our debt.
