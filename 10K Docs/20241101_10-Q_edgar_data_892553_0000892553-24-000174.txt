Certain operating leases contain rent escalation clauses and lease concessions that require additional rental payments in the later years of the term. Rent expense for these types of leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. This expense consisted primarily of payments for base rent on building and equipment leases. Payments related to short-term lease costs and taxes and variable service charges on leased properties were immaterial. In addition, we have the right, but no obligation, to renew certain leases for various renewal terms.

At September 30, 2024, there were in borrowings outstanding under the SSRCF bearing an interest rate of as of December 31, 2023 and in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding supported by the SSRCF. As of September 30, 2024 , we had unused borrowing capacity of . 
 A portion of borrowings outstanding under the SSRCF are denominated in euros EUR Revolver Borrowings ). EUR Revolver Borrowings outstanding were euro million (equivalent to at September 30, 2024 and euro million (equivalent to at December 31, 2023 . 
 Significant financial covenants for the SSRCF include financial maintenance covenants that (i) require the ratio of the amount of Chart and its subsidiaries consolidated total net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be less than the Maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio Levels and (ii) require the ratio of the amount of Chart and its subsidiaries consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense to be greater than the Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio Levels. The SSRCF includes a number of other customary covenants. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants. 
 Term Loans 
 On October 2, 2023, Chart refinanced the remaining aggregate principal amounts of our term loans plus accrued interest in exchange for term loans due March 2030 in the aggregate principal amount of which matures on March 18, 2030. On December 4, 2023, we voluntarily prepaid a portion of our term loans due March 2030 in the amount of , which effectively prepaid all equal quarterly installments for the life of the loan, and as of September 30, 2024, the aggregate principal amount of is due at the March 18, 2030 maturity date. On July 2, 2024, we entered into amendment No. 7 to our Credit Agreement, which among other things reduces the interest rate margins applicable to the term loans due March 2030 by basis points from to in the case of base rate loans, and from to , in the case of Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR loans and eliminates the SOFR credit spread adjustment with respect to the term loans. As of September 30, 2024, the term loans due March 2030 bore an interest rate of as of December 31, 2023). The effective interest rate on the term loans due March 2030 is after accounting for original issue discount and debt issuance costs. 
 Significant financial covenants and customary events of default for the term loans due March 2030 are substantially identical to those in the SSRCF. 
 2024 Convertible Notes 
 On November 6, 2017, we issued Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due November 2024 (the 2024 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of , pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of such date (the Indenture and First Supplemental Indenture dated December 31, 2020. The 2024 Notes bear interest at an annual rate of , payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2018, and will mature on November 15, 2024 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The effective interest rate on the 2024 Notes is after accounting for debt issuance costs. 
 The initial conversion rate for the 2024 Notes is 17.0285 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment as provided for in the Indenture) per 1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share, representing a conversion premium of approximately above the closing price of our common stock of per share on October 31, 2017. For purposes of calculating earnings per share, if the average market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable conversion price during the periods reported, shares contingently issuable under the 2024 Notes will have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock. Since our closing common stock price of at the end of the period exceeded the conversion price of , the if-converted value exceeded the principal amount of the 2024 Notes by at September 30, 2024. As described below, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, which are expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the 2024 Notes. 
 As of October 1, 2024 and until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding November 15, 2024, holders may convert their 2024 Notes at their option. The principal amount of the 2024 Notes is due in November 2024 and was classified as a current liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There have been no significant conversions as of the date of this filing. We expect to fund the

aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes and settle any excess conversion value in shares of Chart common stock. 
 Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions Associated with the 2024 Notes 
 In connection with the pricing of the 2024 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the Note Hedge Transactions with certain parties, including affiliates of the initial purchasers of the 2024 Notes (the Option Counterparties which relate to shares of our common stock and represents the number of shares of our common stock underlying the 2024 Notes. These Note Hedge Transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any future conversion of the 2024 Notes to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of per share. 
 We also entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions (the Warrant Transactions with the Option Counterparties to acquire up to shares of our common stock. The strike price of the Warrant Transactions will initially be per share (subject to adjustment), which is approximately above the last reported sale price of our common stock on October 31, 2017. The Warrant Transactions could have a dilutive effect to our shareholders to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the Warrant Transactions, exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. 
 The Note Hedge Transactions and Warrant Transactions effectively increased the conversion price of the 2024 Notes. 
 Other Debt Facilities 
 In various markets where we do business, we have local credit facilities to meet local working capital demands, fund letters of credit and bank guarantees, and support other short-term cash requirements. The facilities generally have variable interest rates and are denominated in local currency but may, in some cases, facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies. As of September 30, 2024 we had additional capacity of U.S. dollar equivalent . 
 Certain of our other debt facilities allow us to request bank guarantees and letters of credit. None of these facilities allow revolving credit borrowings. We have letters of credit and bank guarantees outside of our Credit Agreement that totaled U.S. dollar equivalent and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

from the issuance of shares less of equity issuance costs. We used the proceeds to fund the acquisition of Howden. 
 Dividends. Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared at an annual rate of on the liquidation value of per share. Chart may pay declared dividends in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of common stock, or in any combination of cash and shares of common stock on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2023 and ending on, and including, December 15, 2025. We declared and paid in dividends for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These dividends were treated as a reduction to income attributable to common shareholders in the computation of earnings per share. 
 Mandatory Conversion. Unless earlier converted, each share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert on the mandatory conversion date, which is expected to be December 15, 2025, into not less than and not more than shares of common stock per share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, depending on the applicable market value and subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. Correspondingly, the conversion rate per depositary share will be not less than and not more than shares of common stock per depositary share. The conversion rate will be determined based on a preceding 20-day volume-weighted-average-price of common stock.

 Optional Conversion of the Holder. Other than during a fundamental change conversion period, at any time prior to December 15, 2025, a holder of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may elect to convert such holder s shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at the Minimum Conversion Rate of shares of common stock per share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (equivalent to shares of common stock per depositary share), subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments. Because each depositary share represents a 1/20th fractional interest in a share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, a holder of depositary shares may convert its depositary shares only in lots of depositary shares. 
 Fundamental Change Conversion. If a fundamental change occurs on or prior to December 15, 2025, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will have the right to convert their shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into shares of common stock at the fundamental change conversion rate during the period beginning on, and including, the effective date of such fundamental change and ending on, and including, the earlier of (a) the date that is 20 calendar days after such effective date (or, if later, the date that is 20 calendar days after holders receive notice of such fundamental change) and (b) December 15, 2025. Holders who convert shares of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock during that period will also receive a make-whole dividend amount comprised of a fundamental change dividend make-whole amount, and to the extent there is any, the accumulated dividend amount. Because each depositary share represents a 1/20th fractional interest in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock, a holder of depositary shares may convert its depositary shares upon a fundamental change only in lots of depositary shares.

 (1) We calculate the basic and diluted earnings per share based on net income, which approximates income available to common shareholders for each period. Earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation formula that determines the earnings per share for common stock and any participating securities according to dividends declared (whether paid or unpaid) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and the 2024 Convertible Notes are participating securities. Undistributed earnings are not allocated to the participating securities because the participation features are discretionary. Net losses are not allocated to the Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, as it does not have a contractual obligation to share in the losses of Chart. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and any dilutive non-participating securities for the period.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this discussion and Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with this discussion. 
 
 Overview 
 We are an independent global leader in the design, engineering, and manufacturing of process technologies and equipment for gas and liquid molecule handling for the Nexus of Clean clean power, clean water, clean food, and clean industrials, regardless of molecule. Our unique product and solution portfolio across stationary and rotating equipment is used in every phase of the liquid gas supply chain, including engineering, service and repair from installation to preventive maintenance and digital monitoring. Chart is a leading provider of technology, equipment and services related to liquefied natural gas, hydrogen, biogas and carbon capture among other applications. We are committed to excellence in environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues both for our company as well as our customers. With 64 global manufacturing locations and over 50 service centers from the United States to Asia, Australia, India, Europe and South America, we maintain accountability and transparency to our team members, suppliers, customers and communities. 
 On March 17, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Howden (the Howden Acquisition ), a leading global provider of mission critical air and gas handling products and services, from affiliates of KPS Capital Partners, LP. Results from continuing operations include results of Howden from the date of acquisition and exclude Roots Roots business financial results for our entire ownership period of March 17, 2023 through the divestiture date, August 18, 2023. The financial information presented and discussion of results that follows is presented on a continuing operations basis unless stated otherwise. 
 Macroeconomic Impacts 
 Geopolitical instability continues to create uncertainty in the global economy, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by countries against Russia, along with the heightened tensions between the United States and China. Moreover, unrest in the Middle East may impact our business and operations and has strained global supply chains, especially those dependent on Red Sea shipping routes. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainty regarding energy policies may affect the timing of certain projects. We are unable to predict the impact these actions will have on the global economy or on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These events did not have a material adverse effect on our reported results for the third quarter of 2024. We continue to actively monitor the impact of these macroeconomic developments on our results of operations for the remainder of 2024 and beyond.

 Chart reduced its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity in 2023 by 27 relative to 2022, achieving its goal of reducing GHG emissions intensity 50 by 2030 (relative to a 2020 baseline) seven years ahead of target. Chart remains committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and also commits to rebaselining and conducting a double materiality assessment in 2024, at which point we plan to set updated targets. We made plant improvements including energy efficient upgrades for various equipment including replacement of diesel powered equipment with electric and installation of LED lighting in office spaces. In addition, we plan to achieve our targets by switching energy from fossil fuel based to carbon free supply and installing on-site renewables where applicable, as well as continuing to participate in ongoing energy audits. At a local site level, we also continue to find ways to reduce both waste-to-landfill as well as mains water usage. 
 For the second year in a row, we continue to track and report our global water consumption and waste recycled, an effort that speaks to our commitment to ESG transparency. 
 In 2023, our executive leadership team was made up of 38 women, with a target for 40 of our leadership team to be women by 2030. 
 We actively participate in local communities through donations and volunteering, working with charitable organizations including Cancer Research, local hospitals, food banks, school and emergency services. 19.6 of our global team participated in Chart-related volunteering in 2023. We remain committed to our target to achieve 25 volunteer participation by 2030. 
 We provide our One Chart global team members with various programs and practices to support our ESG and employee-drive culture:

 Third Quarter 2024 Highlights 
 Strong order activity contributed to ending total backlog of 4,535.3 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 4,140.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and 4,426.0 million as of June 30, 2024. We had consolidated orders of 1,167.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,127.3 million and 1,164.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in orders versus the three months ended September 30, 2023 was largely driven by higher orders in our Heat Transfer Systems and Repair, Service Leasing segments, partially offset by lower orders in the Specialty Products and Cryo Tank Solutions segments. 
 Consolidated sales were 1,062.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 897.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 1,040.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024. Sequentially compared to the second quarter 2024, sales were up 2.1 , driven by higher sales in Heat Transfer Systems and Specialty Products. The increase in Heat Transfer Systems was driven by the continued progress on LNG backlog and other energy related backlog, and the increase in Specialty Products was driven by continued project execution in our hydrogen, carbon capture CCUS and water projects. Compared to the same quarter in 2023 this represents increases in all four segments. Consolidated gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 34.1 increased from 30.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and from 33.8 at June 30, 2024. This increase from the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by our continued execution of commercial and cost synergies as well as improved mix of the business.

 Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and June 30, 2024 
 Sales for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023 increased by 164.6 million, from 897.9 million to 1,062.5 million, or 18.3 , and increased by 22.2 million, from 1,040.3 million to 1,062.5 million, or 2.1 , compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase compared to the same quarter in 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in all four segments with the largest increases in the Repair, Service Leasing and Specialty Products. The increase compared to the second quarter 2024 is primarily attributed to higher sales in Heat Transfer Systems and Specialty Products as we continued to execute on our LNG, other energy related backlog and hydrogen, CCUS and water projects. 
 Gross profit was 362.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 86.4 million, or 31.3 , compared to 276.2 million for the same quarter in 2023 and an increase of 11.0 million or 3.1 compared to 351.6 million for the second quarter in 2024. Gross profit margin of 34.1 for the third quarter of 2024, was an increase of 330 basis points from 30.8 in the third quarter of 2023 and a 30 basis points increase from the second quarter of 2024. The gross profit increases compared to the same quarter 2023 were seen in all four segments, and the increase in gross profit from the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by the Cryo Tank Solutions and Heat Transfer Systems segments and partially offset by decreases in gross profit within our Specialty Products and Repair, Service Leasing segments. The decrease in Specialty Products was driven by specific expenses incurred at our newly opened Theodore facility related to a supplier s machinery startup challenges and associated inefficiencies on specific space related projects. The decrease in Repair, Service Leasing was driven by emergency field service work that did not repeat in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Consolidated selling, general and administrative SG A expenses increased by 12.9 million or 10.5 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023 . This increase in costs is primarily related to integration related costs, other information technology cost timing and a contingent consideration fair value adjustment that did not repeat in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Amortization expense decreased by 0.6 million to 48.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 49.0 million for the same quarter of 2023.

 Interest Expense, Net 
 The following table presents the components of interest expense, net (dollars in millions): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Interest expense term loans due March 2030 32.7 41.3 Interest expense senior secured notes due 2030 27.4 27.3 Interest expense senior unsecured notes due 2031 12.1 12.1 Interest expense senior secured revolving credit facility due April 2029 7.8 9.2 Interest expense convertible notes due November 2024 0.7 0.6 Financing costs amortization 4.8 4.8 Interest income (3.0) (1.9) Capitalized interest (2.2) (1.6) Discontinued operations interest expense, net (3.0) Other 0.3 1.7 Interest expense, net 80.6 90.5 
 Interest expense, net decreased by 9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense, net, was mainly driven by the December 4, 2023 prepayment of term loans due March 2030 in the amount of 150.0 million and associated interest rates reduction from the July 2, 2024 credit agreement amendment, which resulted in lower interest expense incurred in the current period. 
 Financing costs amortization was 4.8 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense of 26.6 million and 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, represents taxes on both U.S. and foreign earnings at a combined effective income tax rate of 26.5 and 1.0 , respectively. The effective income tax rate of 26.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to income earned by certain of our foreign entities being taxed at higher rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate and withholding taxes on foreign earnings not permanently reinvested offset by the U.S. impact of foreign operations and research and development credits. 
 The effective income tax rate of 1.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to one-time impacts from acquisitions and income earned by our certain foreign entities being taxed at higher rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate, offset by research and development credits and excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. 
 Net Income Attributable to Chart Industries, Inc. from Continuing Operations 
 As a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to Chart Industries, Inc. from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 69.4 million and 9.4 million, respectively.

 Sales for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 increased by 716.0 million, from 2,337.5 million to 3,053.5 million driven by increases in all four segments with the largest driver coming from increases in Repair, Service Leasing driven by commercial synergies and the impact of Howden reporting a full first quarter in 2024 compared to a partial first quarter in 2023. 
 Gross profit increased during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 by 310.4 million or 44.0 , while gross profit margin of 33.3 for the first nine months of 2024 increased from 30.2 in the first nine months of 2023 . The increase in gross profit margin for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by a higher mix of aftermarket service and repair with higher margins and achievement of cost synergies. Restructuring costs recorded to cost of sales were 0.7 million and 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 Consolidated SG A expenses increased by 57.0 million or 16.0 during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily driven by the inclusion of Howden SG A expenses in the current period.

 Interest Expense, Net and Financing Costs Amortization 
 The following table presents the components of interest expense, net (dollars in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Interest expense term loans due March 2030 104.3 81.0 Interest expense senior secured notes due 2030 81.5 82.1 Interest expense senior unsecured notes due 2031 36.1 36.3 Interest expense senior secured revolving credit facility due April 2029 22.4 23.6 Interest expense convertible notes due November 2024 2.2 1.9 Financing costs amortization 14.2 12.0 Interest income (7.7) (24.9) Capitalized interest (6.2) (3.0) Discontinued operations interest expense, net (8.9) Other 1.9 2.6 Interest expense, net 248.7 202.7 
 The increase in interest expense, net, is primarily due to higher borrowings outstanding, specifically our term loan, drawn on March 17, 2023 for the Howden Acquisition and an additional incremental term loan drawn on June 30, 2023, compared to borrowings outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, included 24.9 million in interest income earned from deposits of proceeds from the senior secured notes due 2030, senior unsecured notes due 2031, common stock and preferred stock offerings into interest bearing accounts until the consummation of the Howden Acquisition. 
 Financing costs amortization was 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase of 2.2 million was primarily due to the amendment of our senior secured revolving credit facility due April 2029 as well as the issuance of incremental term loans on March 17, 2023 and June 30, 2023, which increased deferred debt issuance costs. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 Income tax expense (benefit) of 50.9 million and (4.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, represents taxes on both U.S. and foreign earnings at a combined effective income tax rate of 24.7 and 840.0 , respectively. The effective income tax rate of 24.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to income earned by our certain foreign entities being taxed at higher rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate and withholding taxes on foreign earnings not permanently reinvested offset by the U.S. impact of foreign operations and research and development credits. 
 The effective income tax rate of 840.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to one-time impacts from acquisitions and income earned by our certain foreign entities being taxed at higher rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate, offset by research and development credits and excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. 
 Net Income Attributable to Chart Industries, Inc. from Continuing Operations 
 As a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to Chart Industries, Inc. for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 141.7 million and 0.1 million, respectively.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Debt Instruments and Related Covenants 
 Our debt instruments and related covenants are described in Note 10, Debt and Credit Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 9, Debt and Credit Arrangements to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included under Item 1, Financial Statements in this report. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 The discussion of sources and uses of cash that follows is presented on a consolidated basis. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents totaled 312.5 million at September 30, 2024 , an increase of 111.4 million from the balance at December 31, 2023. Our foreign subsidiaries held cash of 278.2 million and 170.1 million, at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. No material restrictions exist to accessing cash held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds that invest in high quality, short-term instruments, such as U.S. government obligations, certificates of deposit, repurchase obligations, and commercial paper issued by corpo rations that have been highly rated by at least one nationally recognized rating organization, and in the case of cash equivalents in Chin a, obligations of local banks. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, funds available under our senior secured revolving credit facility due April 2029 or other financing alternatives, and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our normal working capital needs, capital expenditures and investments for the foreseeable future. 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 221.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 184.7 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of 36.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to strong operating performance, cash management, and costs associated with the Howden Acquisition in the comparative period. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 121.6 million and 4,154.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 100.3 million for capital expenditures and 13.1 million mainly for investments in Hy24. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 4,322.3 million for the Howden Acquisition, 115.4 million for capital expenditures and 8.8 million mainly for investments in Avina and Hylium Industries. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received 291.9 million in proceeds from the sale of our Roots TM business. 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 6.8 million and 1,678.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we borrowed 2,286.7 million and repaid 2,246.5 million in borrowings on our revolving credit facility and paid 20.4 million of dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we borrowed incremental term loans in the aggregate principal amount of 1,534.8 million, in connection with the Howden Acquisition, and borrowed incremental term loans in the aggregate principal of 250.0 million, for general corporate purposes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, w e borrowed 1,334.3 million on our revolving credit facilities and raised 11.7 million in proceeds for the issuance of common stock, primarily to fund the Howden Acquisition and repaid 1,234.3 million in borrowings on our credit facilities. A portion of debt repayments was funded with the proceeds from the divestiture of Roots TM . During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we paid 133.5 million in debt issuance costs and paid 20.5 million of dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock. We also paid 12.2 million in dividend distributions to noncontrolling interest owners during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash Requirements 
 We do not currently anticipate any unusual cash requirements for working capital needs for the year ending December 31, 2024 . Man agement anticipates we will be able to satisfy cash requirements for our ongoing business for the foreseeable future with cash generated by operations, existing cash balances and available borrowings under our credit facilities. 
 As described in Note 9, Debt and Credit Arrangements to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included under Item 1, Financial Statements in this report, our 2024 Notes mature on November 15, 2024, unless earlier converted or repurchased. As of October 1, 2024 and through the maturity date, the 2024 Notes continue to be convertible at the option of the holder. There have been no significant conversions as of the date of this filing. We expect to fund the maturing 2024 Notes with cash on hand and available borrowings under our credit facilities. We expect to pay cash up to the 258.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes and settle any excess conversion value in shares of Chart common stock. We entered into convertible note hedge transactions, which are expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the 2024 Notes.

 Orders and Backlog 
 We consider orders to be those for which we have received a firm signed purchase order or other written contractual commitment from the customer. Backlog is comprised of the portion of firm signed purchase orders or other written contractual commitments from customers for which work has not been performed, or is partially completed, that we have not recognized as revenue and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders. Our backlog as of September 30, 2024 was 4,535.3 million, compared to 4,140.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and 4,426.0 million as of June 30, 2024.

The decrease in Cryo Tank Solutions segment orders during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same quarter last year was primarily driven by the third quarter of 2023 having a non-repeating order for railcars of 19.2 million and slower demand in China. C ryo Tank Solutions segment backlog at September 30, 2024 totaled 316.5 million compared to 449.4 million as of September 30, 2023 and 358.2 million as of June 30, 2024 .

The increase in orders from the three months ended September 30, 2023 and three months ended June 30, 2024 was mainly driven by increased orders in LNG. Heat Transfer Systems segment backlog at September 30, 2024 totaled 1,878.0 million, as compared to 1,657.5 million and 1,709.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively.

The decrease in Specialty Products segment orders during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and three months ended June 30, 2024 was mainly driven by lower orders in hydrogen and helium applications. Specialty Products segment backlog totaled 1,755.3 million as of September 30, 2024 , compared to 1,460.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and 1,806.4 million as of June 30, 2024 .

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. A summary of areas where we apply critical judgment can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets (including finite-lived intangible assets), business combinations, investments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, contingencies, revenue from contracts with customers and income taxes. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values that can affect the cost of operating and financing. Accordingly, we address a portion of these risks through a program of risk management. 
 Interest Rate Risk: Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from various floating rate pricing mechanisms contained in our senior secured revolving credit facility due April 2029 and term loans due March 2030. If interest rates were to increase 100 basis points (1 percent) from the weighted-average interest rate for our senior secured revolving credit facility due April 2029 of 6.4 at September 30, 2024, and assuming no changes in the 142.3 million of borrowings outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility due April 2029 at September 30, 2024, our additional annual expense would be approximately 1.4 million on a pre-tax basis. If interest rates were to increase 100 basis points (1 percent) from the interest rate for our term loans due March 2030 of 7.8 at September 30, 2024, and assuming no changes in the 1,631.0 million of 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 borrowings outstanding under our term loans due March 2030 at September 30, 2024, our additional annual expense would be approximately 16.3 million on a pre-tax basis. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk: We operate in the United States and other foreign countries, which creates exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business, which can impact our financial position, results of operations, cash flow, and competitive position. The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into their U.S. dollar equivalents at end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities, while income and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are components of other comprehensive income as reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Translation exposure is primarily with the euro, the Czech koruna, the Chinese yuan, the South African rand, the British pound and the Indian rupee. During the third quarter of 2024, the U.S. dollar weakened in relation to the euro, Czech koruna, Chinese yuan, South African rand and the British pound by 4 , 4 , 2 , 6 and 6 , respectively. There was no notable movement between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. At September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the U.S. dollar would not materially affect our financial statements. 
 EUR Revolver Borrowings: Additionally, assuming no changes in the euro 78.0 million in EUR Revolver Borrowings outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility due April 2029 and an additional 100 basis points (1 percent) strengthening in the U.S dollar in relation to the euro as of the beginning of 2024, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, our additional unrealized foreign currency gain would be approximately 0.8 million on a pre-tax basis. 
 Transaction Gains and Losses: Chart s primary transaction exchange rate exposures are with the euro, the Chinese yuan, the Czech koruna, the Indian rupee, the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the South African rand. Transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as a component of foreign currency gain. 
 Derivative Instruments: We enter into foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate foreign currency risk for anticipated and firmly committed foreign currency transactions. At September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10 weakening of the U.S. dollar would not materially affect our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts. We enter into a combination of cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange collars as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. As disclosed in Note 9, Debt and Credit Arrangements, we have an out-of-the-money protective call while writing a put option with a strike price at which the premium received is equal to the premium of the protective call purchased, which involved no initial capital outlay. The call was structured with a strike price higher than our cost basis in such investments, thereby limiting any foreign exchange losses to approximately 11.4 million on a pre-tax basis. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The terms of the contracts are generally one to three years. 
 Market Price Sensitive Instruments 
 In connection with the pricing of the 2024 Notes, we entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the Note Hedge Transactions with certain parties, including affiliates of the initial purchasers of the 2024 Notes (the Option Counterparties which relate to 4.41 million shares of our common stock and represents the number of shares of our common stock underlying the 2024 Notes. These Note Hedge Transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes. 
 We also entered into separate, privately-negotiated warrant transactions with the Option Counterparties to acquire up to 4.41 million shares of our common stock. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock to the extent that the price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants unless we elect, subject to certain conditions, to settle the warrants in cash. The strike price of the warrant transactions related to the 2024 Notes was initially 71.775 per share. Further information is located in Note 9, Debt and Credit Arrangements to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are occasionally subject to various other legal claims related to performance under contracts, product liability, taxes, employment matters, environmental matters, intellectual property, and other matters incidental to the normal course of our business. Based on our historical experience in litigating these claims, as well as our current assessment of the underlying merits of the claims and applicable insurance, if any, management believes that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, cash flows, or results of operations. Future developments may, however, result in resolution of these legal claims in a way that could have a material adverse effect.
