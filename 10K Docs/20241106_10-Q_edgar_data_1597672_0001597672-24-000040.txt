Recent Accounting Developments 
 Change in Accounting Policy 
 On January 1, 2024, the Company changed the method of valuation of its finished goods, work-in-process and raw materials inventories from first-in first-out to average cost. The Company believes the average cost method is preferable because it provides better matching of revenue and expense trends and is a better reflection of periodic income from operations. This change was not retrospectively applied to prior periods presented, as the overall effect of the change is not deemed material to the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 Altamaha Green Energy Joint Venture 
 The Company is involved with AGE, under a preliminary joint venture agreement with Beasley Green Power, LLC. AGE aims to construct a biomass boiler and turbine to produce and sell green electricity to Georgia Power Company. AGE is not engaged in any other operating activities and since formation it has only been focused on developing feasibility studies for this project and handling related administrative matters. AGE expenses to date have been shared evenly by RYAM and Beasley and have not been material for the Company for any of the periods presented. The amounts expensed by the Company have been recorded as general and administrative expenses. Once the project evolves from the development stage and the current joint venture agreement between the Company and Beasley is amended to reflect the appropriate terms, the Company will evaluate the accounting and disclosure implications. 
 Accounting Pronouncements 
 There have been no new or recently adopted accounting pronouncements impacting the Company s consolidated interim financial statements. The Company continues to evaluate the impacts of ASU 2023-05 Business Combinations Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement, ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures and ASU 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures as previously disclosed in its 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Subsequent Events 
 Debt Issuance and Redemption 
 In October 2024, the Company raised million in aggregate principal amount of secured term loan financing and received net proceeds of million after original issue discount, which will be used in the fourth quarter, together with cash on hand, to redeem the respective million and million outstanding principal balances of the 2026 Notes and 2027 Term Loan and pay estimated fees and expenses related to the transaction of approximately million.

 percent and requires quarterly principal payments of million. The initial spread may fluctuate by one half percent based on the Company s net secured leverage ratio. If net secured leverage is below times covenant EBITDA, the spread decreases to percent. If net secured leverage exceeds times covenant EBITDA, the spread increases to percent. 
 The Company may voluntarily make prepayments at any time, subject to customary breakage costs and, if within the first three anniversaries of closing, an additional premium. For the first 18 months, prepayment of the loan is subject to a make-whole premium. For the following six months, prepayment is subject to a percent premium. In the third year, prepayment is subject to a percent premium. After 3 years, the loan is prepayable at par percent premium during the first year, a percent premium in year two, and par to 1.00 for the fourth quarter of 2024 through fiscal year 2025; 
 to 1.00 for fiscal year 2026; and 
 to 1.00 for each fiscal year thereafter. 
 The agreement governing the 2029 Term Loan contains various other customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, as defined by the term loan agreement, to take certain specified actions, subject to certain exceptions, including: incurring debt or liens, making investments, entering into mergers, consolidations, and acquisitions, paying dividends and making other restricted payments. Additionally, the 2029 Term Loan contains customary affirmative covenants and customary events of default (subject, in certain cases, to customary grace or cure periods), including, without limitation, late payment, breach of covenant, bankruptcy, judgment and defaults under certain other indebtedness and changes in control. 
 In conjunction with the above refinancing, the Company secured commitments for a million ABL credit facility. The facility is initially priced at Term SOFR plus a spread of percent. 
 The Company expects to record a net loss on debt extinguishment in the fourth quarter of approximately million related to these transactions, driven by the write off of deferred financing costs of the 2026 Notes, 2027 Term Loan and ABL Credit Facility. 
 Jesup Plant Fire 
 In October 2024, an isolated fire occurred at the Company s Jesup plant during planned maintenance activity. There were no injuries to employees or contractors and no risk to the surrounding community. The plant s C line operations resumed within two days and the A and B lines operations resu med within a two-week period. While the Company continues to assess the financial impact of the incident, the unfavorable impact to EBITDA in 2024 is expected to approximate million, with an additional required million of maintenance capital . Additional capital expenditures will be required over the next couple of years to complete repairs. The Company carries insurance for property and business interruption loss with a million combined deductible. 
 
 million. Potential remaining one-time charges to be incurred in the fourth quarter are estimated at million to million. While most cash costs associated with the suspension of operations will be paid in the third and fourth quarters, severance and other suspension costs are expected to be paid over a period of time.

 million, as it was determined that the Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose plant s net carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value. Determining the fair value of an asset group is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company determined the fair value of the Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose plant asset group using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which required the use of key assumptions and significant estimates. See Note 10 Fair Value Measurements for further information on the fair value measurement of the Temiscaming plant asset group.

 The above costs incurred were charged to the High Purity Cellulose segment in indefinite suspension charges in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 million in softwood lumber duties from 2017 through 2021, and as of December 31, 2023, the Company had a million long-term receivable related to USDOC administrative reviews completed to date. In June 2024, the Company executed on the sale of these refund rights (inclusive of the receivable), including all accrued interest, for million, with the opportunity for additional sale proceeds in the future contingent upon the timing and terms of the ultimate outcome of the trade dispute between the USDOC and Canada. The Company recorded a million loss on the sale, included in pre-tax income from discontinued operations. 
 Also during the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company recognized million in pre-tax income from discontinued operations related to CEWS benefit claims deferred since 2021. See Note 7 Accrued and Other Current Liabilities for further information. 
 During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the USDOC completed its administrative review of duties applied to Canada softwood lumber exports to the U.S. during 2021 and reduced rates applicable to the Company, for which the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of million. Also during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a million loss related to the settlement of a claim pursuant to the representations and warranties in the asset purchase agreement.

 Term Loan 
 In January 2024, the Company amended the 2027 Term Loan to increase the maximum consolidated net secured leverage ratio that it must maintain in the fourth quarter of 2023 and through its 2024 fiscal year (see below). In addition, should the Company exceed the to 1.00 maximum ratio established by the original agreement in any of these quarters, it will incur a fee of of the principal balance outstanding at the end of the applicable quarter. The Company incurred total fees of million related to this amendment, including million in legal and advisory fees recorded to selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the fourth quarter of 2023, and million in lender fees recorded as deferred financing costs in the first quarter of 2024 that will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the loan. 
 The Company is required to maintain various financial covenants, including a consolidated net secured leverage ratio, based on covenant EBITDA, as follows: 
 to 1.00 for the fourth quarter of 2023 through the second quarter of 2024; 
 to 1.00 for the third fiscal quarter of 2024;

 Increase in liabilities Payments ) Foreign currency adjustments ) Balance at September 28, 2024 
 Less: current portion ) Non-current environmental liabilities 
 In addition to these estimated liabilities, the Company is subject to the risk of reasonably possible additional liabilities in excess of the established liabilities due to potential changes in circumstances and future events, including, without limitation, changes to current laws and regulations; changes in governmental agency personnel, direction, philosophy or enforcement policies; developments in remediation technologies; increases in the cost of remediation, operation, maintenance and monitoring of its environmental liability sites; changes in the volume, nature or extent of contamination to be remediated or monitoring to be undertaken; the outcome of negotiations with governmental agencies or non-governmental parties; and changes in accounting rules or interpretations. Based on information available as of September 28, 2024, the Company estimates this exposure could range up to approximately million, although no assurances can be given that this amount will not be exceeded given the factors described above. These potential additional costs are attributable to several sites and other applicable liabilities. This estimate excludes liabilities that would otherwise be considered reasonably possible but for the fact that they are not currently estimable, primarily due to the factors discussed above. 
 Subject to the previous paragraph, the Company believes its estimates of liabilities are sufficient for probable costs expected to be incurred over the next years with respect to its environmental liabilities. However, no assurance is given that these estimates will be sufficient for the reasons described above and additional liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

 million non-cash impairment related to the Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose plant asset group. The fair value of the Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose plant assets was determined using discounted cash flows under the income approach from the perspective of a market participant assuming the highest and best use of the asset group. Discounted cash flows were estimated using key assumptions regarding production levels, price levels, profit margins, capital expenditures and discount rate, which are Level 3 measurements.

 The effective tax rates for the quarter and nine months ended September 28, 2024 differed from the federal statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance on disallowed interest deductions, the release of certain tax reserves, different statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, U.S. tax credits, excess deficit on vested stock compensation and return-to-accrual adjustments. 
 The effective tax rates for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the federal statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to disallowed interest deductions in the U.S. and nondeductible executive compensation, offset by U.S. tax credits, return-to-accrual adjustments related to previously filed tax returns, changes in the valuation allowance on disallowed interest deductions and interest received on overpayments of tax from prior years . The effective tax rate for the nine-month period was also impa cted by an excess tax benefit on vested stock compensation. 
 Deferred Taxes 
 As of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s net DTA included million and million, respectively, of disallowed U.S. interest deductions that the Company does not believe will be realized. The asset decreased million as a result of a tax expense recognized in the current year. In strict compliance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Technical Questions and Answers 3300.01-02, which asserts that certain material evidence regarding the realizability of disallowed U.S. interest deductions should be ignored when assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company has recognized a valuation allowance on this portion of the net DTA generated from disallowed interest.

 Litigation and Contingencies 
 Duties on Canadian Softwood Lumber Sold to the U.S. 
 The Company previously operated softwood lumber mills in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, and exported softwood lumber into the U.S. from Canada . In connection with these exports, the Company paid approximately million of softwood lumber duties between 2017 and August 2021, including million of ancillary fees, which were recorded as expense in the periods incurred. As part of the sale of its lumber assets in 2021, the Company retained all refund rights and obligations to softwood duties generated or incurred through the closing date of the sale. As of December 31, 2023 , the Company had a million long-term receivable associated with USDOC determinations of the revised duty rates for 2017 through 2021. In June 2024, the Company executed on the sale of these refund rights (inclusive of the receivable), including all accrued interest, for million, with the opportunity for additional sale proceeds in the future contingent upon the timing and terms of the ultimate outcome of the trade dispute between the USDOC and Canada. 
 Other 
 In addition to the above, the Company is engaged in various legal and regulatory actions and proceedings and has been named as a defendant in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. While the Company has procured reasonable and customary insurance covering risks normally occurring in connection with its business, the Company has, in certain cases, retained some risk through the operation of self-insurance, primarily in the areas of workers compensation, property insurance, business interruption and general liability. These other lawsuits and claims, either individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Guarantees and Other 
 The Company provides financial guarantees as required by creditors, insurance programs and various governmental agencies. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had net exposure of million from various standby letters of credit, primarily for financial assurance relating to environmental remediation, credit support for natural gas and electricity purchases and guarantees related to foreign retirement plan obligations. These standby letters of credit represent a contingent liability; the Company would only be liable upon its default on the related payment obligations. The standby letters of credit have various expiration dates and are expected to be renewed as required. 
 The Company had surety bonds of million as of September 28, 2024, primarily to comply with financial assurance requirements relating to environmental remediation and post-closure care, to provide collateral for the Company s workers compensation program and to guarantee taxes and duties for products shipped internationally. These surety bonds expire at various dates and are expected to be renewed annually as required. 
 LTF is a venture in which the Company owns percent and its partner, Borregaard ASA, owns percent. The Company is a guarantor of LTF s financing agreements and, in the event of default, expects it would only be liable for its proportional share of any repayment under the agreements. The Company s proportion of the LTF financing agreement guarantee was million at September 28, 2024.

 Business Overview 
 We are a global leader of specialty cellulose materials with a broad offering of high purity cellulose specialties, a natural polymer used in the production of a variety of specialty chemical products, including liquid crystal displays, filters, textiles and performance additives for pharmaceutical, food and other industrial applications. Building upon more than 95 years of experience in cellulose chemistry, we provide some of the highest quality high-purity cellulose pulp products that make up the essential building blocks for our customers products while providing exceptional service and value. Our specialized assets are also used to produce biofuels, bioelectricity and other biomaterials such as bioethanol and tall oils. We also produce a unique, lightweight multi-ply paperboard product and a bulky, high-yield pulp product. Our paperboard is used for production in the commercial printing, lottery ticket and high-end packaging sectors. Our high-yield pulp is used by paperboard producers, as well as in traditional printing, writing and specialty paper manufacturing. 
 We operate in three business segments: High Purity Cellulose, Paperboard and High-Yield Pulp. 
 Recent Business Developments 
 In October 2024, we secured term loan financing of 700 million in aggregate principal amount and received net proceeds of 683 million after original issue discount, which will be used in the fourth quarter, together with cash on hand, to redeem the outstanding principal balances of the 2026 Notes and the 2027 Term Loan and pay fees and expenses related to the transaction. In conjunction with this refinancing, we secured commitments for a five-year 175 million ABL credit facility. See Note 1 Basis of Presentation to our Financial Statements. 
 In October 2024, an isolated fire occurred at our Jesup plant during planned maintenance activity. We estimate an unfavorable impact to EBITDA in 2024 from the incident of approximately 10 million and additional required maintenance capital of 3 million. See Note 1 Basis of Presentation to our Financial Statements. 
 In September 2024, we announced price increases for our cellulose specialties products of up to 10 percent, depending on product grade, as contracts allow. This increase was driven by market dynamics, cost inflation and other economic drivers. 
 In September 2024, we repurchased 12 million principal of our 2026 Notes through open-market transactions for 12 million cash. See Note 8 Debt and Finance Leases to our Financial Statements.

Table of Contents 

In July 2024, we indefinitely suspended operations at our Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose plant and in September 2024, we recorded a 25 million non-cash asset impairment, among other charges, related to the suspension. See Note 2 Indefinite Suspension of Operations to our Financial Statements. 
 In June 2024, we recognized 15 million in pre-tax income related to CEWS benefit claims deferred since 2021. See Note 3 Discontinued Operations and Note 7 Accrued and Other Current Liabilities to our Financial Statements. 
 In June 2024, we sold our refund rights, including interest, related to softwood lumber duties paid from 2017 through 2021 for 39 million. See Note 3 Discontinued Operations to our Financial Statements. 
 In January 2024, we amended our 2027 Term Loan agreement to increase the maximum consolidated net secured leverage ratio that we must maintain in the fourth quarter of 2023 and through fiscal year 2024. In addition, should we exceed the maximum ratio established by the original agreement during this period, we will incur a fee of 0.25 of the principal balance outstanding at the end of the applicable quarter. See Note 8 Debt and Finance Leases to our Financial Statements. 
 Business Outlook 
 In October 2023, we announced that we are exploring the potential sale of our Paperboard and High-Yield Pulp assets located at our Temiscaming site. We remain committed to pursuing a sale of these assets at a fair price. 
 In July 2024, we indefinitely suspended operations at our Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose plant. This plan is expected to mitigate high capital needs and operating losses related to exposure to commodity viscose products and improve our consolidated free cash flow; however, future operational loss reductions will be partially offset by continuing custodial site expenses. In connection with the suspension of operations, we have incurred one-time operating charges, including mothballing and severance and other employee costs, of 14 million and a 25 million non-cash asset impairment. Potential remaining one-time charges to be incurred in the fourth quarter are estimated at 2 million to 3 million. For 2024, the suspension of the Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose plant is expected to be positive to Adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow is expected to increase by 30 million to 35 million in 2024 as lower capital expenditures and benefits from the monetization of working capital are expected to more than offset the one-time and other cash costs associated with the suspension of operations. 
 In October 2024, an isolated fire occurred at our Jesup plant during planned maintenance activity. There were no injuries to employees or contractors and no risk to the surrounding community. The plant s C line operations resumed within two days and the A and B lines operations resum ed within a two-week period. While we continue to assess the financial impact of the incident, the unfavorable impact to EBITDA in 2024 is expected to approximate 10 million, with an additional required 3 million of maintenance capital . Additional capital expenditures will be required over the next couple of years to complete repairs. We carry insurance for property and business interruption loss with a 15 million combined deductible. 
 The following market assessment represents our current outlook of our business segments future performance. 
 High Purity Cellulose 
 Average sales prices for cellulose specialties in 2024 are expected to increase by a low single-digit percentage as compared to average sales prices in 2023 as we continue to prioritize value over volume. Sales volumes for cellulose specialties are expected to increase compared to 2023 driven by increased volumes from the closure of a competitor s plant, a modest increase in ethers demand and additional volume sold to customers affected by the indefinite suspension of Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose operations, partially offset by a one-time favorable impact from a change in customer contract terms in the prior year first quarter, customer destocking in the acetate markets and reduced sales related to the fire in Jesup. Demand for RYAM s commodity products remains steady. Sales prices for fluff products are expected to decline by a high single-digit percentage compared to 2023, while sales volumes are projected to increase by nearly 30 percent year over year. For non-fluff commodities, average sales prices are expected to rise by a mid-single-digit percentage over 2023 levels, though sales volumes are expected to decrease nearly 50 percent compared to 2023 levels, aligned with strategic initiatives to reduce exposure to non-fluff commodities. Pricing for all commodity High Purity Cellulose products is forecasted to soften slightly in Q4, with volumes seeing a modest increase sequentially. Costs are expected to be lower in 2024 driven by lower key input and logistics costs, improved productivity and the suspension of operations at the Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose plant, partially offset by increased costs due to the timing of maintenance projects, net custodial site expenses related to the suspension and recovery costs related to the Jesup fire. Our bioethanol facility in Tartas, France became operational in the first quarter of 2024 and is expected to deliver approximately 3 million to 4 million of EBITDA in 2024, growing to 8 million to 10 million beginning in 2025. EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to be lower than the third quarter of 2024 due to the anticipated net custodial site expenses at the Temiscaming site, Jesup fire repair costs and the impact of the fire on sales and costs.

Table of Contents 

Looking forward to 2025, we announced price increases of up to 10 percent for our cellulose specialties products, as contracts allow, and expect higher margins for cellulose specialties in the coming year. We expect to continue reducing our exposure to non-fluff commodities in 2025. 
 Paperboard 
 Paperboard prices are expected to decrease in the fourth quarter while sales volumes are expected to increase. Raw material prices are expected to increase compared to the third quarter. Overall, we expect a decline in EBITDA from this segment in the coming quarters as market pressure continues with new competitive supply coming online in 2025. 
 High-Yield Pulp 
 High-Yield Pulp prices are expected to decline in the fourth quarter, while sales volumes are expected to increase significantly due to timing of shipments. Overall, we expect to incur a loss in EBITDA from this segment in the coming quarter due to the decline in sales prices. Current pricing is expected to remain low in the coming quarters. 
 Corporate 
 Corporate costs are expected to decrease in the fourth quarter subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
 Biomaterials Strategy 
 We continue to invest in new products to provide both increased end market diversity and incremental profitability. These new products will target the growing green energy and renewable product markets. Current projects include: 
 Our bioethanol facility in Tartas, France is operating to available feedstock and represents a significant milestone towards our goal of generating 42 million of annual EBITDA from all of RYAM s future biomaterial products in 2027. 
 We have submitted notice of our GRAS self-certification for a prebiotics product to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and continue to move forward with plans for a bioethanol facility in Fernandina. 
 Our involvement in AGE, a company that aims to utilize renewable forestry waste and other biomass generally discarded as waste to generate sustainable electricity for the state of Georgia. While still in the development phase, the project achieved a significant milestone when AGE was recently awarded a Purchase Power Agreement to sell electricity to Georgia Power Company. Additional information regarding the progress of this project will be shared in 2025. 
 We are also advancing various other projects and expect to secure financing for many of these projects in the coming quarter.

 Operating loss for the quarter ended September 28, 2024 increased 3 million, or 21 percent, compared to the same prior year quarter primarily driven by 7 million in one-time costs incurred related to the indefinite suspension of Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose operations and an associated 25 million non-cash asset impairment. The loss also included 4 million of Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose continuing custodial site costs. The increase in the quarter s operating loss was further driven by lower Paperboard net sales and higher purchased pulp costs. Partially offsetting these increases to the loss were the higher net sales in High Purity Cellulose and High-Yield Pulp, lower key input and labor costs in High Purity Cellulose and higher productivity in High-Yield Pulp. 
 Operating results for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 improved 32 million, or 800 percent, compared to the same prior year period despite one-time charges of 14 million related to the indefinite suspension of Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose operations and an associated 25 million non-cash asset impairment. Results also included 4 million of Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose continuing custodial site costs. The improvement in operating results was driven by higher Paperboard net sales, lower key input, logistics and labor costs in High Purity Cellulose, lower purchased pulp costs in Paperboard, lower logistics, chemicals and wood costs and higher productivity in High-Yield Pulp and the recognition of 10 million in CEWS benefit claims deferred since 2021. Partially offsetting these improvements, in addition to the indefinite suspension charges, asset impairment and custodial site costs, were lower High Purity Cellulose and High-Yield Pulp net sales, the impact of the timing of planned maintenance outages compared to the prior year, the prior year recognition of a 3 million benefit from payroll tax credit carryforwards that we do not expect to repeat and 11 million of energy cost benefits from sales of excess emission allowances recognized in the prior year, the current year sales of which are expected in the fourth quarter. 
 See Operating Results by Segment below for further discussion. 
 Non-Operating Income Expense 
 Interest expense for the quarter and nine months ended September 28, 2024 was nearly flat and increased 10 million, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. The increase in the nine-month period was driven by an increase in the average effective interest rate on debt, partially offset by a decrease in the average outstanding principal balance. Total debt increased 24 million from September 30, 2023 to September 28, 2024, as we secured 26 million of green capital to further our biomaterials strategy. 
 Interest income for the quarter and nine months ended September 28, 2024 decreased 2 million and 3 million, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods driven by the prior year timing of the receipt of the 2027 Term Loan proceeds and their subsequent use in the repayment of senior notes. 
 Unfavorable foreign exchange rates during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 compared to favorable rates in the same prior year quarter resulted in a net unfavorable impact of 1 million. The net impact when comparing the current and prior year nine-month periods was favorable but immaterial. 
 Also included in other income (expense), net in the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a 1 million net loss on debt extinguishment. Additionally, we recorded a 2 million gain on a passive land sale and a 2 million pension settlement loss in the prior year nine-month period.

Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate on the loss from continuing operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 28, 2024 was a benefit of 13 percent and 19 percent, respectively. The 2024 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance on disallowed interest deductions, the release of certain tax reserves, different statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, U.S. tax credits, excess deficit on vested stock compensation and return-to-accrual adjustments. 
 The effective tax rate on the loss from continuing operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a benefit of 17 percent and 22 percent, respectively. The 2023 effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to disallowed interest deductions in the U.S. and nondeductible executive compensation, offset by U.S. tax credits, return-to-accrual adjustments related to previously filed tax returns, changes in the valuation allowance on disallowed interest deductions and interest received on overpayments of tax from prior years. The effective tax rate for the nine-month period was also impacted by an excess tax benefit on vested stock compensation. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we recorded pre-tax income from discontinued operations of 5 million related to CEWS benefit claims deferred since 2021 and a pre-tax loss of 1 million on the sale of our softwood lumber duty refund rights. 
 During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the USDOC completed its administrative review of duties applied to Canada softwood lumber exports to the U.S. during 2021 and reduced rates applicable to us, for which we recorded a pre-tax gain of 2 million. Also during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred a 2 million pre-tax loss related to the settlement of a claim pursuant to the representations and warranties in the asset purchase agreement.

Net sales of our High Purity Cellulose segment for the quarter ended September 28, 2024 increased 33 million compared to the same prior year quarter. Included in the current and prior year quarters were 26 million and 28 million, respectively, of other sales primarily from bio-based energy and lignosulfonates. Total sales prices increased 13 percent due to a higher mix of cellulose specialties and included 2 percent and 5 percent increases in cellulose specialties and commodity prices, respectively. Total sales volumes were nearly flat as a 32 percent increase in cellulose specialties volumes was offset by a 24 percent decrease in commodity volumes. The cellulose specialties sales volumes increase includes additional volumes sold to customers affected by the indefinite suspension of Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose operations that began in the third quarter, the closure of a competitor s plant in late 2023, the easing of prior year customer destocking and a continued uptick in ethers sales volumes. The decrease in commodity sales volumes was primarily driven by a higher mix of cellulose specialties production and the indefinite suspension of Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose operations.

 Net sales of our High Purity Cellulose segment for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was nearly flat compared to the same prior year period. Included in the current and prior year nine-month periods were 72 million and 73 million, respectively, of other sales primarily from bio-based energy and lignosulfonates. Total sales prices increased 5 percent due to a 1 percent increase in cellulose specialties prices that was partially offset by a 3 percent decrease in commodity prices. Despite a cellulose specialties sales volumes increase of 10 percent, total sales volumes decreased 5 percent driven by a 19 percent decrease in commodity volumes. Increased cellulose specialties sales volumes resulting from the additional volumes sold ahead of the suspension of Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose operations, the closure of a competitor s plant in late 2023, the easing of prior year customer destocking and an uptick in ethers sales volumes were partially offset by the one-time favorable impact from a change in customer contract terms in the prior year first quarter. The decrease in commodity sales volumes was primarily driven by a higher mix of cellulose specialties production and the indefinite suspension of Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Cash flows from operations, primarily driven by operating results, have historically been our primary source of liquidity and capital resources. As operating cash flows can be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market prices for our commodity products and changes in demand for our products, we maintain a key focus on cash, managing working capital closely and optimizing the timing and level of our capital expenditures. We believe our future cash flows from operations, availability under our ABL Credit Facility and our ability to access the capital markets, if necessary or desirable, will be adequate to fund our operations and anticipated long-term funding requirements, including capital expenditures, defined benefit plan contributions and repayment of debt maturities. 
 Our Board of Directors suspended our quarterly common stock dividend in September 2019. No dividends have been declared since. The declaration and payment of future common stock dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our debt facilities place limitations on the declaration and payment of future dividends. 
 In January 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a 100 million common stock share buyback program. We have not repurchased shares under this program since 2018 and do not expect to utilize any of the remaining 60 million in unused authorization in the future. 
 Our non-guarantor subsidiaries had assets of 468 million, liabilities of 416 million, year-to-date revenue of 173 million and a trailing twelve month ABL Credit Facility and Term Loan covenant EBITDA for continuing operations of 15 million as of September 28, 2024. 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are summarized below: 
 (in millions, except ratios) September 28, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 136 76 Availability under the ABL Credit Facility (a)(b) 
 135 118 Total debt (b) 
 773 777 Stockholders equity 733 747 Total capitalization (total debt plus stockholders equity) 1,506 1,524 Debt to capital ratio 51 51 
 
 (a) Amounts available under the ABL Credit Facility fluctuate based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory levels. At September 28, 2024, we had 170 million of gross availability and net available borrowings of 135 million after taking into account outstanding letters of credit of 35 million. In addition to the availability under the ABL Credit Facility, we have 10 million available under our accounts receivable factoring line of credit in France. 
 (b) See Note 8 Debt and Finance Leases to our Financial Statements for further information. 
 Cash Requirements 
 Contractual Commitments 
 Our principal contractual commitments include standby letters of credit, surety bonds, guarantees, purchase obligations and leases. We utilize arrangements such as standby letters of credit and surety bonds to provide credit support for certain suppliers and vendors in case of their default on critical obligations, collateral for certain of our self-insurance programs and guarantees for the completion of our remediation of environmental liabilities. As part of our ongoing operations, we also periodically issue guarantees to third parties. Our primary purchase obligation payments relate to natural gas, steam energy and wood chips purchase contracts. There have been no material changes to our contractual commitments during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 We remain subject to purchase obligations under the 20-year wood chip and residual fiber supply agreement with GreenFirst, under which total required purchase volumes of wood chips and residual fiber are dependent on sawmill production. In connection with the indefinite suspension of operations at the Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose plant, we and GreenFirst have agreed that we will purchase the required volumes at market value and sell them to third parties at the same amount for an expected neutral impact. 
 See Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies to our Financial Statements for further information.

Debt 
 As of September 28, 2024 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our debt agreements. 
 See Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Note 8 Debt and Finance Leases to our Financial Statements for further information of the following transactions. 
 2026 Notes . In September 2024, we repurchased 12 million principal of our 2026 Notes through open-market transactions for 12 million cash. See Note 8 Debt and Finance Leases to our Financial Statements for further information. 
 2027 Term Loan . In January 2024, we amended the 2027 Term Loan to increase the maximum consolidated net secured leverage ratio that we must maintain beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023 and through our 2024 fiscal year. The amendment provides us with the operational flexibility to execute our strategic initiatives in 2024. Should we exceed the maximum ratio established by the original agreement in any of these quarters, we will incur a fee of 0.25 of the principal balance outstanding at the end of the applicable quarter. 
 Debt issuance and redemption . In October 2024, we raised 700 million in aggregate principal amount of secured term loan financing and received net proceeds of 683 million after original issue discount, which will be used in the fourth quarter, together with cash on hand, to redeem the respective 453 million and 246 million outstanding principal balances of the 2026 Notes and 2027 Term Loan and pay fees and expenses related to the transaction. The 2029 Term Loan matures in October 2029, bears interest at an annual rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus an initial spread of 7 percent and requires quarterly principal payments of 1.75 million. The initial spread may fluctuate by one half percent based on our net secured leverage ratio. We may voluntarily make prepayments at any time, subject to customary breakage costs and, if within the first three anniversaries of closing, an additional premium. The agreement governing the 2029 Term Loan contains various customary covenants, including the requirement to maintain a specified consolidated net secured leverage ratio, based on covenant EBITDA. 
 In conjunction with the above refinancing, we secured commitments for a five-year 175 million ABL credit facility. The facility is initially priced at Term SOFR plus a spread of 2 percent. 
 Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended (in millions) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 149 82 Investing activities (80) (95) Financing activities (10) (112) 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased 67 million primarily due to proceeds of 39 million for the sale of our softwood lumber duty refund rights, net tax refunds of 20 million in the current year compared to net tax payments in the prior year and higher payments in the prior year on deferred energy liabilities associated with our Tartas facility operations. These cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows from working capital in the current year compared to inflows in the prior year and higher payments of interest on long-term debt. 
 Cash used in investing activities decreased 15 million primarily due to the timing of payments of capital expenditures, lower strategic capital spend and lower custodial capital spend due to the indefinite suspension of operations. 
 Cash used in financing activities decreased 102 million primarily due to lower net repayment of long-term debt, a decrease in debt issuance costs and a decrease in repurchases of common stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements related to the issuance of stock under our incentive stock plans. 
 
 Performance and Liquidity Indicators 
 The discussion below is presented to enhance the reader s understanding of our operating performance, liquidity and ability to generate cash and satisfy rating agency and creditor requirements. This information includes the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flows. These measures are not defined by GAAP and our discussion of them is not intended to conflict with or change any of our GAAP disclosures provided in this report. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, to determine management incentive compensation and for budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes. Our management considers these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to operating income, to be important in estimating our enterprise and stockholder values and for making strategic and operating decisions. In addition, analysts, investors and creditors use these non-GAAP financial measures when analyzing our operating performance, financial condition and cash-generating ability. We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as performance measures and adjusted free cash flows as a liquidity measure. 
 We do not consider non-GAAP financial measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our Financial Statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. To compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided below. Non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily indicative of results that may be generated in future periods and should not be relied upon, in whole or part, in evaluating our financial condition, results of operations or future prospects. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for items that management believes are not representative of our core operations.

 EBITDA from continuing operations for the quarter ended September 28, 2024 decreased 4 million compared to the same prior year quarter driven by the costs incurred related to the indefinite suspension of Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose operations, non-cash asset impairment and Temiscaming High Purity Cellulose continuing custodial site costs. The decrease was further driven by lower Paperboard net sales and higher purchased pulp costs. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher net sales in High Purity Cellulose and High-Yield Pulp, lower key input and labor costs in High Purity Cellulose and higher productivity in High-Yield Pulp. 
 EBITDA from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased 32 million compared to the same prior year period driven by higher Paperboard net sales, lower key input, logistics and labor costs in High Purity Cellulose, lower purchased pulp costs in Paperboard, lower logistics, chemicals and wood costs and higher productivity in High-Yield Pulp and the CEWS benefit. Partially offsetting these increases were the costs incurred related to the indefinite suspension of operations, non-cash asset impairment, continuing custodial site costs, lower High Purity Cellulose and High-Yield Pulp net sales, the impact of the timing of planned maintenance outages compared to the prior year and the prior year recognition of benefits from payroll tax credit carryforwards and sales of excess emission allowances that did not repeat in the current year. 
 See Results of Operations above for additional discussion of the changes in our operating results. 
 Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 Adjusted free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities adjusted for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of assets and excluding strategic capital expenditures deemed discretionary by management. Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure of cash generated during a period that is available for debt reduction, strategic capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock. Adjusted free cash flow is not necessarily indicative of the adjusted free cash flow that may be generated in future periods.

See Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows above for additional discussion of our operating cash flows. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market and Other Economic Risks 
 We are exposed to various market risks, primarily changes in interest rates, currency and commodity prices. Our objective is to minimize the economic impact of these market risks. We may use derivatives in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Finance Strategic Planning Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 Foreign Currency 
 We manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. We may also use foreign currency forward contracts to manage these exposures. The principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the potential volatility and financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. 
 Prices 
 The prices, sales volumes and margins of the commodity products of our High Purity Cellulose segment and all the products of the High-Yield Pulp segment have historically been cyclically affected by economic and market shifts, fluctuations in capacity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These products have less distinguishing qualities from producer to producer and competition is based primarily on price, which is determined by market supply relative to demand. The overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture, and consequently our sales and profitability, reflect fluctuations in end user demand. Our cellulose specialties product prices are impacted by market supply and demand, raw material and processing costs, changes in global currencies and other factors. 
 Certain key input costs, such as wood fiber, chemicals and energy, may experience significant price fluctuations, also impacted by market shifts, fluctuations in capacity and other demand and supply dynamics. We may periodically enter into commodity forward contracts to fix some of our energy costs that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. Such forward contracts partially mitigate the risk of changes to our gross margins resulting from an increase or decrease in these costs. Forward contracts that are derivative instruments are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at their fair values, unless they qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception and such exception has been elected, in which case, the fair values of such contracts are not recognized in the balance sheet. 
 Variable Interest Rates 
 As of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 250 million and 255 million, respectively, of variable rate debt subject to interest rate risk. At these borrowing levels, a hypothetical one percent change in interest rates would have resulted in a 2 million annual change in interest expense for each of these periods. 
 The fair market value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk when the debt becomes due or if we do not hold the debt until maturity. The estimated fair value of our fixed-rate debt at September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 532 million and 498 million, respectively, compared to its respective 538 million and 540 million carrying values. We use quoted market prices to estimate the fair value of our fixed-rate debt. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.

Table of Contents 

In October 2024, we secured variable-rate term loan financing of 700 million, which will be used in the fourth quarter, together with cash on hand, to redeem the respective 453 million and 246 million outstanding principal balances of the 2026 Notes and 2027 Term Loan. The 2029 Term Loan bears interest at an annual rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus 7 percent. For this new debt, a hypothetical one percent change in interest rates would result in a 7 million annual change in interest expense. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no control evaluation can provide absolute assurance that all control exceptions and instances of fraud have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance their objectives are achieved. 
 Based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2024. 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 For the quarter ended September 28, 2024, based upon the evaluation required by SEC Rule 13a-15(d), there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that would materially affect or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings
