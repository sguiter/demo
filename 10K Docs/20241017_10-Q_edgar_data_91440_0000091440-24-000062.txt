portfolio segments, finance and contract receivables, which are the same segments used to estimate expected credit losses reported in the allowances for credit losses. The amortized cost basis for finance and contract receivables is the amount originated adjusted for applicable accrued interest and net of deferred fees or costs, collections, and write-offs. The company monitors and assesses credit risk based on the characteristics of each portfolio segment. 
 When extending credit, Snap-on evaluates the collectability of the receivables based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that may affect a customer s ability to pay. These factors may include the customer s financial condition, past payment experience, and credit bureau and proprietary Snap-on credit model information, as well as the value of the underlying collateral. 
 For finance and contract receivables, Snap-on assesses quantitative and qualitative factors through the use of credit quality indicators consisting primarily of delinquency classification, collection experience and credit exposure by customer. Delinquency is the primary indicator of credit quality for finance and contract receivables. Snap-on conducts monthly reviews of credit and collection performance for both the finance and contract receivable portfolios focusing on data such as delinquency trends, nonaccrual receivables, and write-off and recovery activity. These reviews allow for the formulation of collection strategies and potential collection policy modifications in response to changing risk profiles in the finance and contract receivable portfolios. The company also maintains a system that aggregates credit exposure and provides delinquency data by days past due aging categories. A receivable days or more past due is considered delinquent. However, customer receivables are monitored prior to becoming days past due. 
 Non-delinquent Total Finance receivables Finance receivables charge-offs Contract receivables: Delinquent Non-delinquent Total Contract receivables Contract receivables charge-offs 
 Allowances for credit losses: The allowances for credit losses are maintained at levels that are considered adequate to cover expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the receivables using historical loss experience, asset specific risk characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and an appropriate reversion period, when applicable. Management performs detailed reviews of its receivables on a monthly and/or quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowances and to determine if any impairment has occurred. A receivable generally has credit losses when it is expected that all amounts related to the receivable will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the agreement. Amounts determined to be uncollectable are charged directly against the allowances, while amounts recovered on previously written off accounts increase the allowances.

days past due. Repossessed accounts are typically written off within days of asset repossession. Contract receivables related to equipment leases are generally written off when an account becomes days past due, while contract receivables related to franchise finance and van leases are generally written off no later than when the receivable becomes days past the asset return date. For finance and contract receivables, customer bankruptcies are generally written off upon notification that the associated debt is not being reaffirmed or, in any event, no later than when the receivable becomes days past due. Changes to the allowances for credit losses are maintained through adjustments to the provisions for credit losses. 
 For finance receivables, the company uses a vintage loss rate methodology to determine expected losses. Vintage analysis aims to calculate losses based on the timing of the losses relative to the origination of the receivables. The finance receivable portfolio contains a substantial amount of homogeneous contracts which fits well with the vintage analysis. 
 For contract receivables, the company primarily uses a Weighted-Average Remaining Maturity WARM methodology. The WARM methodology calculates the average annual write-off rate and applies it to the remaining term of the receivables. The WARM methodology is used since contract receivables have limited loss experience over generally longer terms and, therefore, the predictive loss patterns are more difficult to estimate. 
 The company performed a correlation analysis to compare historical losses to many economic factors. The primary economic factors considered were real gross domestic product, civilian unemployment, industrial production index, and repair and maintenance employment rate; the company determined that there is limited correlation between the historical losses and economic factors. As a result, consideration was given to qualitative factors to adjust the reserve balance for asset specific risk characteristics, current conditions and future expectations. Similar qualitative factors are considered for both finance and contract receivables. The qualitative factors used in determining the estimate of expected credit losses are influenced by the changes in the composition of the portfolio, underwriting practices, and other relevant conditions that were different from the historical periods. 
 The allowances for credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in the credit risk and expected lifetime credit losses.

 Past due: Depending on the contract, payments for finance and contract receivables are due on a monthly or weekly basis. Weekly payments are converted into a monthly equivalent for purposes of calculating delinquency. Delinquencies are assessed at the end of each month following the monthly equivalent contractual payment due date. The entire receivable balance of a contract is considered delinquent when contractual payments become days past due. Removal from delinquent status occurs when the cumulative amount of monthly contractual payments then due have been received by the company. 
 It is the general practice of Snap-on s financial services business not to engage in contract or loan modifications. In limited instances, Snap-on s financial services business may modify certain receivables. The amount and number of finance and contract receivable modifications as of September 28, 2024, and December 30, 2023, were immaterial to both the financial services portfolio and the company s results of operations and financial position.

 Nonaccrual: SOC maintains the accrual of interest income during the progression through the various stages of delinquency prior to processing for write-off. At the time of write-off, the entire balance including the accrued but unpaid interest income amount is recorded as a loss. 
 Finance receivables are generally placed on nonaccrual status (nonaccrual of interest and other fees): (i) when a customer is placed on repossession status; (ii) upon receipt of notification of bankruptcy; (iii) upon notification of the death of a customer; or (iv) in other instances in which management concludes collectability is not reasonably assured. 
 Contract receivables are generally placed on nonaccrual status: (i) when a receivable is more than days past due or at the point a customer s account is placed on terminated status regardless of its delinquency status; (ii) upon notification of the death of a customer; or (iii) in other instances in which management concludes collectability is not reasonably assured. 
 The accrual of interest and other fees is resumed when the finance or contract receivable becomes contractually current and collection of all remaining contractual amounts due is reasonably assured. A receivable may have credit losses when it is expected that all amounts related to the receivable will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the applicable agreement. Such finance and contract receivables are covered by the company s respective allowances for credit losses and are written-off against the allowances when appropriate.

 Counterparty risk: Snap-on is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements, including its foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements, treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements. Snap-on does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of A- or better.

 Fair value of financial instruments: 
 Contract receivables net Long-term debt and notes payable 
 
 The following methods and assumptions are used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments: 
 
 Finance and contract receivables include both short-term and long-term receivables. The fair value estimates of finance and contract receivables are derived utilizing discounted cash flow analyses performed on groupings of receivables that are similar in terms of loan type and characteristics. The cash flow analyses consider recent prepayment trends where applicable. The cash flows are discounted over the average life of the receivables using a current market discount rate of a similar term adjusted for credit quality. Significant inputs to the fair value measurements of the receivables are unobservable and, as such, are classified as Level 3. 
 
 Fair value of long-term debt is estimated, using Level 2 fair value measurements, based on quoted market values of Snap-on s publicly traded senior debt. The carrying value of long-term debt includes unamortized debt issuance costs and issuance discounts. The fair value of notes payable approximates such instruments carrying value due to their short-term nature. 
 
 The fair value of all other financial instruments, including trade and other accounts receivable, accounts payable and other financial instruments, approximates such instruments carrying value due to their short-term nature.

 The effects of new requirements, legislation, regulations or government-related developments or issues, as well as third party actions, including those addressing climate change; 
 Potential reputational damages and costs related to litigation; 
 The impact of outbreaks of infectious diseases as well as the effects of governmental actions related thereto on Snap-on s business, which could have the potential to amplify the impact of the other risks facing the company; and 
 Other world or local events outside Snap-on s control, including terrorist disruptions, armed conflicts and civil unrest. 
 Snap-on disclaims any responsibility to update any forward-looking statement provided in this document, except as required by la w. 
 In ad dition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP prescribe when a company should reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for a major contingency. Reported results, therefore, may appear to be volatile in certain accounting periods. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 References in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to organic sales refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude acquisition-related sales and the impact of foreign currency translation. Management evaluates the company s sales performance based on organic sales growth, which primarily reflects growth from the company s existing businesses as a result of increased output, expanded customer base, geographic expansion, new product development and pricing changes, and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prior-year reporting period. Organic sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in the company s businesses and facilitates comparisons of its sales performance with prior periods.

 Financial services revenue is generally dependent on the size of the average financial services portfolio during the period, as well as on the average yield on receivables. Financial services revenue of 100.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 increased 5.5 million, or 5.8 , from last year. In the third quarters of both 2024 and 2023, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7 . In the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, the average yields on contract receivables were 9.1 and 8.8 , respectively. Originations of 288.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 represented a decrease of 17.2 million, or 5.6 , from 2023 levels.

In the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the average yields on contract receivables were 9.0 and 8.7 , respectively. Originations of 897.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 represented a decrease of 34.6 million , or 3.7 , from 2023 levels. 
 Financial services expenses in the first nine months of 2024 increased primarily due to higher provisions for credit losses as compared to those recorded last year.

 Corporate 
 Snap-on s third quarter 2024 general corporate expenses of 24.2 million compared to 31.2 million last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower performance-based compensation and other costs. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, general corporate expenses of 49.2 million compared to 92.7 million recorded in 2023. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects benefits from the legal payments received in the first six months of 2024 and lower performance-based compensation and other costs.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Snap-on s growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing. Snap-on believes that its cash from operations and collections of finance receivables, coupled with its sources of borrowings and available cash on hand, are sufficient to fund its currently anticipated requirements for scheduled debt repayments, payments of interest and dividends, new receivables originated by our financial services businesses, capital expenditures, working capital, funding of pension plans, and share repurchases and acquisitions, if and as they arise. 
 Due to Snap-on s credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at an acceptable cost. As of October 11, 2024, Snap-on s long-term debt and commercial paper were rated, respectively, A2 and P-1 by Moody s Investors Service; A- and A-2 by Standard Poor and A and F1 by Fitch Ratings. Snap-on believes that its current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility, including through access to financial markets for potential new financing, to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. However, Snap-on cannot provide any assurance that financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms, or that its debt ratings will not decrease. 
 The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of 3,044.3 million as of September 28, 2024, represented an increase of 333.9 million from 2,710.4 million as of December 30, 2023 (fiscal 2023 year end), primarily as a result of the net changes discussed below. 
 The following represents the company s working capital position as of September 28, 2024, and December 30, 2023: 
 
 (Amounts in millions) September 28, 2024 December 30, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 1,313.3 1,001.5 Trade and other accounts receivable net 796.4 791.3 Finance receivables net 624.7 594.1 Contract receivables net 122.1 120.8 Inventories net 995.8 1,005.9 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 148.4 138.4 Total current assets 4,000.7 3,652.0 Notes payable (14.3) (15.6) Accounts payable (270.0) (238.0) Other current liabilities (672.1) (688.0) Total current liabilities (956.4) (941.6) Working capital 3,044.3 2,710.4 
 Cash and cash equivalents of 1,313.3 million as of September 28, 2024, represented an increase of 311.8 million from 2023 year-end levels primarily due to: (i) 924.0 million of cash generated from operations; (ii) 629.3 million of cash from collections of finance receivables; and (iii) 61.6 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase plans and stock option exercises. These increases in cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by: (i) the funding of 731.3 million of new finance receivables; (ii) dividend payments to shareholders of 294.1 million; (iii) the repurcha se of 637,000 sha res of the company s common stock for 177.5 million; and (iv) the funding of 65.4 million of capital expenditures. 
 Of the 1,313.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September 28, 2024, 507.7 million was held outside of the United States. Snap-on maintains non-U.S. funds in its foreign operations to: (i) provide adequate working capital; (ii) satisfy various regulatory requirements; and/or (iii) take advantage of business expansion opportunities as they arise. Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act generally eliminated U.S. federal taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries, such dividends may still be subject to state income taxation and foreign withholding taxes. Snap-on periodically evaluates its cash held outside the United States and may pursue opportunities to repatriate certain foreign cash amounts to the extent that it can be accomplished in a tax efficient manner.

 Trade and other accounts receivable net of 796.4 million as of September 28, 2024, compared to 791.3 million as of December 30, 2023, an increase of 5.1 million primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding, partially offset by 1.6 million of foreign currency translation. Days sales outstanding (trade and other accounts receivable net as of the respective period end, divided by the respective trailing 12 months of sales, times 360 days) was 61 days for September 28, 2024, and 60 days for December 30, 2023. 
 The current portions of net finance and contract receivables of 746.8 million as of September 28, 2024, compared to 714.9 million at 2023 year end. The long-term portions of net finance and contract receivables of 1,731.1 million as of September 28, 2024, compared to 1,692.1 million at 2023 year end. The combined 70.9 million increase in net current and long-term finance and contract receivables over 2023 year-end levels is primarily due to net receivable originations and 4.9 million of foreign currency translation. 
 Inventories net of 995.8 million as of September 28, 2024, decreased 10.1 million compared to 1,005.9 million as of December 30, 2023, primaril y due to easing supply chain disruptions, partially offset by 0.8 million of foreign currency translation. Inventory turns (trailing 12 months of cost of goods sold, divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balances for the trailing 12 months) were 2.3 turns as of both September 28, 2024, and December 30, 2023. Inventories accounted for using the first-in, first-out FIFO method approximated 58 of total inventories as of September 28, 2024, and 59 of total inventories as of December 30, 2023. All other inventories are accounted for using the last-in, first-out LIFO method. The company s LIFO reserve was 125.7 million and 115.9 million as of September 28, 2024, and December 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Notes payable of 14.3 million as of September 28, 2024, compared to 15.6 million as of 2023 year end. 
 Accounts payable of 270.0 million as of September 28, 2024, compared to 238.0 million as of December 30, 2023, an increase of 32.0 million primarily due to the timing of payments, partially offset by 1.2 million of foreign currency translation. 
 Other accrued liabilities of 450.0 million as of September 28, 2024, compared to 447.4 million as of 2023 year end, an increase of 2.6 million, including 0.3 million of foreign currency translation. 
 Long-term debt of 1,185.3 million as of September 28, 2024, consisted of: (i) 300 million of unsecured 3.25 notes that mature on March 1, 2027 (the 2027 Notes (ii) 400 million of unsecured 4.10 notes that mature on March 1, 2048 (the 2048 Notes and (iii) 500 million of 3.10 notes that mature on May 1, 2050 the 2050 Notes ), partially offset by 14.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and issuance discounts. 
 Snap-on has a 900 million multicurrency revolving credit facility that terminates on September 12, 2028 (the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility contains an accordion feature that, subject to certain customary conditions, may allow the maximum commitment to be increased by up to 450 million with the approval of the lenders providing additional commitments. No amounts were borrowed or outstanding under the Credit Facility during the nine months ended and as of September 28, 2024. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at varying rates based on either: (i) Snap-on s then-current, long-term debt ratings; or (ii) Snap-on s then-current ratio of consolidated debt net of certain cash adjustments Consolidated Net Debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other adjustments for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended (the Consolidated Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio ). The Credit Facility s financial covenant requires that Snap-on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, either (i) a ratio not greater than 0.60 to 1.00 of Consolidated Net Debt to the sum of Consolidated Net Debt plus total equity and less accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (the Leverage Ratio or (ii) a Consolidated Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. Snap-on may, up to two times during any five-year period during the term of the Credit Facility (including any extensions thereof), elect to increase the maximum Leverage Ratio to 0.65 to 1.00 and/or increase the maximum Consolidated Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 for four consecutive fiscal quarters in connection with certain material acquisitions (as defined in the related credit agreement). As of September 28, 2024, the company s consolidated cash balance, net of certain adjustments, exceeded consolidated debt resulting in actual ratios of (0.01) and (0.03), respectively. Both ratios are within the permitted ranges set forth in this financial covenant. 
 Snap-on generally issues commercial paper to fund its financing needs on a short-term basis and uses the Credit Facility as back-up liquidity to support such commercial paper issuances. As of September 28, 2024, there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding.

 (continued) 

 Snap-on believes it has sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a short-term and long-term basis. Snap-on manages its aggregate short-term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under the Credit Facility. Snap-on believes that it can access short-term debt markets, predominantly through commercial paper issuances and existing lines of credit, to fund its short-term requirements and to ensure near-term liquidity. Snap-on regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and, if it believes conditions are favorable, it may take advantage of such conditions to issue long-term debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources. Near-term liquidity requirements for Snap-on include payments of interest and dividends, funding to support new receivables originated by our financial services businesses, capital expenditures, working capital, the funding of pension plans, and funding for share repurchases and acquisitions, if and as they arise. Snap-on intends to make contributions of 6.0 million to its foreign pension plans and 3.7 million to its domestic pension plans in 2024, as required by law. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap-on may make discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2024. 
 Snap-on s long-term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs, including the potential use of commercial paper, additional fixed-term debt and/or securitizations. 
 The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 924.0 million and 857.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 66.7 million year-over-year increase in net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects a 23.7 million change in net operating assets and liabilities and a 31.4 million increase in net earnings. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used by investing activities of 163.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 included additions to finance receivables of 731.3 million, partially offset by collections of 629.3 million. Net cash used by investing activities of 227.2 million in the first nine months of 2023 included additions to finance receivables of 779.8 million, partially offset by collections of 626.5 million. Finance receivables are comprised of extended-term installment payment contracts to both technicians and independent shop owners (i.e., franchisees customers) to enable them to purchase tools, diagnostics, and equipment products on an extended-term payment plan, with average payment terms of approximately four years. 
 Capital expenditures were 65.4 million and 73.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures in both years included continued investments related to the company s execution of its strategic Value Creation Processes around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and RCI. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used by financing activities was 448.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 423.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. Proceeds from stock purchase plans and stock option exercises totaled 61.6 million and 94.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the first nine months of 2024, Snap-on repurchased 637,000 shares of its common stock for 177.5 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. In the first nine months of 2023, Snap-on repurchased 909,000 shares of its common stock for 233.8 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. As of September 28, 2024, Snap-on had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional 471.5 million in common stock pursuant to its Board s authorizations. The repurchase of Snap-on common stock to offset dilution related to equity plan issuances or for other corporate purposes is at the company s discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the company s additional share repurchases, if any. 
 Snap-on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends totaled 294.1 million and 257.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. On November 2, 2023, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 14.8 to 1.86 per share 7.44 per share annualized). Snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to pay dividends.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Snap-on s critical accounting policies and estimates, which are discussed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, have not materially changed since the report was filed. 
 Outlook 
 We believe that our markets and our operations possess and have demonstrated continuing and considerable resilience against the uncertainties of the current environment. For the remainder of 2024, Snap-on expects to make ongoing progress along its defined runways for coherent growth, leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including extending in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. In pursuit of these initiatives, we project that capital expenditures in 2024 will approximate 100 million, of which 65.4 million was incurred in the first nine months of the year. 
 Snap-on currently anticipates that its full-year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 22 to 23 .

 Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 There has been no significant change in the company s exposure to market risk during the third quarter of 2024. Refer to Part II, Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 for further discussion. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 Snap-on may manage the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of Snap-on s borrowings through the use of interest rate swap agreements. Treasury lock agreements may be used to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of fixed rate debt. See Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on interest rate risk management. 
 Snap-on utilizes a Value-at-Risk VAR model to determine the potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange-sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level. Snap-on s computations are based on the inter-relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates (variance/co-variance technique). These inter-relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter. 
 The estimated maximum potential net one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, as of September 28, 2024, was 9.9 million, consisting of a 10.0 million loss on interest rate-sensitive financial instruments and a 0.1 million gain on foreign currency-sensitive financial instruments. The VAR model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by Snap-on, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. 

Item 4: Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Snap-on maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries is timely communicated to the officers who certify Snap-on s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board, as appropriate. 
 In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), the company s management evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 28, 2024. Based upon their evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 There has been no change in the company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 28, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)).

 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 The following chart discloses information regarding the shares of Snap-on s common stock repurchased by the company during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, all of which were purchased pursuant to the Board s authorizations that the company has publicly announced. Snap-on has undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution related to equity plan issuances and for other corporate purposes, as well as when the company believes market conditions are favorable. The repurchase of Snap-on common stock is at the company s discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions, and pursuant to the Board s authorizations that the company has publicly announced.

 Subject to further adjustment pursuant to the 1996 Authorization described below, as of September 28, 2024, the approximate value of shares that may yet be 
 purchased pursuant to the outstanding Board authorizations discussed below is 471.5 million. 
 
 In 1996, the Board authorized the company to repurchase shares of the company s common stock periodically in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions (the 1996 Authorization ). The 1996 Authorization allows the repurchase of up to the number of shares issued or delivered from treasury under the various plans the company has in place that call for the issuance of the company s common stock. Because the number of shares that are purchased pursuant to the 1996 Authorization will change as (i) the company issues shares under its various plans; and (ii) shares are repurchased pursuant to this authorization, the number of shares authorized to be repurchased will vary from time to time. The 1996 Authorization will expire when terminated by the Board. 
 
 On November 4, 2021, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of the company s common stock (the 2021 Authorization ). On August 8, 2024, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of the company s common stock (the 2024 Authorization ). The 2024 Authorization replaced the 2021 Authorization (under which approximately 260 million remained as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024) and, will expire when the aggregate repurchase price limit is met, unless terminated earlier by the Board. 
 
 Other Purchases or Sales of Equity Securities 
 The following chart discloses information regarding transactions by a counterparty in shares of Snap-on s common stock during the third quarter of 2024 pursuant to a prepaid equity forward agreement (the Agreement that is intended to reduce the impact of market risk associated with the stock-based portion of the company s deferred compensation plans. The company s stock-based deferred compensation liabilities increase as the company s stock price rises and decrease as the company s stock price declines. Pursuant to the Agreement, the counterparty may purchase or sell shares of the company s common stock for its account in the market or in privately negotiated transactions. At termination, the Agreement settles in cash and does not provide for Snap-on to purchase or repurchase its shares. 
 Period Shares purchased (sold) Average price per share 6/30/2024 to 7/27/2024 (800) 271.41 7/28/2024 to 8/24/2024 8/25/2024 to 9/28/2024 400 272.99 Total/Average (400) 271.94
