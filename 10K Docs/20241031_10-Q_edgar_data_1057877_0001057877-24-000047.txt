 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 In addition to the historical information contained in this report, this report contains (and oral communications made by IDACORP and Idaho Power may contain) statements that relate to future events and expectations, such as statements regarding projected or future financial performance, power generation, cash flows, capital expenditures, regulatory filings, dividends, capital structure or ratios, load forecasts, strategic goals, challenges, objectives, and plans for future operations. Such statements constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, or future events or performance, often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as "anticipates," "believes," "could," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "potential," "plans," "predicts," "preliminary," "projects," "targets," "may," "may result," or similar expressions, are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, involve estimates, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, and may differ materially from actual results, performance, or outcomes. In addition to any assumptions and other factors and matters referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements, factors that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements include those factors set forth in this report, the 2023 Annual Report, particularly Part I, Item 1A - "Risk Factors" and Part II, Item 7 - MD A of that report, subsequent reports filed by IDACORP and Idaho Power with the SEC, and the following important factors: 
 
 decisions or actions by the Idaho and Oregon public utilities commissions and the FERC that impact Idaho Power's ability to recover costs and earn a return on investment; 
 changes to or the elimination of Idaho Power's regulatory cost recovery mechanisms; 
 expenses and risks associated with capital expenditures for, and the permitting and construction of, utility infrastructure projects that Idaho Power may be unable to complete, are delayed, or that may not be deemed prudent by regulators for cost recovery or return on investment; 
 expenses and risks associated with supplier and contractor delays and failure to satisfy project quality and performance standards on utility infrastructure projects, and the potential impacts of those delays and failures on Idaho Power's ability to serve customers; 
 the rapid addition of new industrial and commercial customer load and the volatility of such new load demand, resulting in increased risks and costs of power demand potentially exceeding supply and of purchasing energy and capacity in the market or acquiring or constructing additional capacity and energy resources, and the potential financial impacts of industrial customers not meeting forecasted power usage ramp rates or amounts; 
 impacts of economic conditions, including an inflationary or recessionary environment and increased interest rates, on items such as operations and capital investments, supply costs and delivery delays, supply scarcity and shortages, population growth or decline in Idaho Power's service area, changes in customer demand for electricity, revenue from sales of excess power, credit quality of counterparties and suppliers and their ability to meet financial and operational commitments and on the timing and extent of their power usage, and collection of receivables; 
 changes in residential, commercial, and industrial growth and demographic patterns within Idaho Power's service area, and the associated impacts on loads and load growth; 
 employee workforce factors, including the operational and financial costs of unionization or the attempt to unionize all or part of the companies workforce, the cost and ability to attract and retain skilled workers and third-party contractors and suppliers, the cost of living and the related impact on recruiting employees, and the ability to adjust to fluctuations in labor costs; 
 changes in, failure to comply with, and costs of compliance with laws, regulations, policies, orders, and licenses, which may result in penalties and fines, increase compliance and operational costs, and impact recovery associated with increased costs through rates; 
 abnormal or severe weather conditions (including conditions and events associated with climate change), wildfires, droughts, earthquakes, and other natural phenomena and natural disasters, which affect customer sales, hydropower generation, repair costs, service interruptions, public safety power shutoffs and de-energization, liability for damage caused by utility property, and the availability and cost of fuel for generation plants or purchased power to serve customers; 
 advancement and adoption of self-generation, energy storage, energy efficiency, alternative energy sources, and other technologies that may reduce Idaho Power's sale or delivery of electric power or introduce operational vulnerabilities to the power grid; 
 variable hydrological conditions and over-appropriation of surface and groundwater in the Snake River Basin, which may impact the amount of power generated by Idaho Power's hydropower facilities and power supply costs; 
 5 

Table of Contents 

 ability to acquire equipment, materials, fuel, power, and transmission capacity on reasonable terms and prices, particularly in the event of unanticipated or abnormally high resource demands, price volatility, lack of physical availability, transportation constraints, outages due to maintenance or repairs to generation or transmission facilities, disruptions in the supply chain, or reduced credit quality or lack of counterparty and supplier credit; 
 disruptions or outages of Idaho Power's generation or transmission systems or of any interconnected transmission systems, which can result in liability for Idaho Power, increased power supply costs and repair expenses, and reduced revenues; 
 accidents, electrical contacts, fires (either affecting or caused by Idaho Power facilities or infrastructure), explosions, infrastructure failures, general system damage or dysfunction, and other unplanned events that may occur while operating and maintaining assets, which can cause unplanned outages; reduce generating output; damage company assets, operations, or reputation; subject Idaho Power to third-party claims for property damage, personal injury, or loss of life; or result in the imposition of fines and penalties ; 
 acts or threats of terrorism, acts of war, social unrest, cyber or physical security attacks, and other malicious acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations or the electric power grid or compromise data, or the disruption or damage to the companies business, operations, or reputation resulting from such events; 
 increased costs associated with purchases of power mandated by PURPA from renewable energy sources; 
 Idaho Power s concentration in one industry and one region, and the resulting exposure to regional economic conditions and regional legislation and regulation; 
 unaligned goals and positions with co-owners of Idaho Power's generation and transmission assets; 
 changes in tax laws or related regulations or interpretations of applicable laws or regulations by federal, state, or local taxing jurisdictions, and the availability of tax credits; 
 inability to timely obtain and the cost of obtaining and complying with required governmental permits and approvals, licenses, rights-of-way, and siting for transmission and generation projects and hydropower facilities; 
 ability to obtain debt and equity financing or refinance existing debt when necessary and on satisfactory terms, which can be affected by factors such as credit ratings, reputational harm, volatility or disruptions in the financial markets, interest rates, decisions by the Idaho, Oregon, or Wyoming public utility commissions, and the companies' past or projected financial performance; 
 ability to enter into financial and physical commodity hedges with creditworthy counterparties to manage price and commodity risk for fuel, power, and transmission, and the failure of any such risk management and hedging strategies to work as intended, and the potential losses the companies may incur on those hedges, which can be affected by factors such as the volume of hedging transactions and degree of price volatility; 
 changes in actuarial assumptions, changes in interest rates, increasing health care costs, and the actual and projected return on plan assets for pension and other postretirement plans, which can affect future pension and other postretirement plan funding obligations, costs, and liabilities and the companies' cash flows; 
 remediation costs associated with planned cessation of coal-fired operations at Idaho Power's co-owned coal plants and conversion of the plants to natural gas; 
 ability to continue to pay dividends and achieve target dividend payout ratios based on financial performance and capital requirements, and in light of credit rating considerations, contractual covenants and restrictions, and regulatory limitations; 
 adoption of or changes in accounting policies and principles, changes in accounting estimates, and new SEC or New York Stock Exchange requirements or new interpretations of existing requirements; and 
 changing market dynamics due to the emergence of day ahead or other energy and transmission markets in the western United States. 
 
 Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the companies to predict all such factors, nor can they assess the impact of any such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. IDACORP and Idaho Power disclaim any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking information, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

Additionally, the 2024 Idaho Limited-Issue Rate Case application: 
 
 applies the overall rate of return approved in the 2023 Settlement Stipulation; 
 does not seek to adjust any other revenue requirement components such as non-labor O M expense, net power supply costs, or other revenue; 
 does not propose changes to any other Idaho regulatory mechanisms, such as the power cost adjustment, fixed cost adjustment, or energy efficiency rider; and 
 continues to reflect the 2023 Settlement Stipulation amounts for categories other than incremental plant and O M labor costs. 
 
 Written testimony from the Staff of the IPUC and intervenors in the 2024 Idaho Limited-Issue Rate Case and Idaho Power's rebuttal testimony are due in November 2024. Technical hearings before the IPUC are scheduled for December 2024. Idaho Power is unable to predict the outcome of the 2024 Idaho Limited-Issue Rate Case. Idaho Power anticipates that new rates, if approved by the IPUC, would become effective on or after January 1, 2025. 
 
 In December 2023, Idaho Power filed a general rate case with the OPUC. In September 2024, the OPUC issued an order approving the 2024 Oregon Settlement Stipulations, which are settlement stipulations among Idaho Power and intervening parties settling the general rate case. The OPUC order and the 2024 Oregon Settlement Stipulations contain the following significant terms, among other items: 
 
 Idaho Power will implement revised tariff schedules designed to increase annual Oregon-jurisdiction revenue by million, or percent; and 
 A percent Oregon-jurisdiction return on year-end equity and a percent Oregon-jurisdiction authorized rate of return based on a percent cost of debt and capital structure of 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity, applied to an Oregon-jurisdictional rate base of approximately million. 
 
 Rate changes from the 2024 Oregon Settlement Stipulations became effective on October 15, 2024. The 2024 Oregon Settlement Stipulations do not preclude Idaho Power from filing another general rate case or other limited issue proceeding in Oregon at any time in the future. 
 
 Idaho ADITC Mechanism 
 
 The May 2018 Idaho settlement stipulation related to tax reform (2018 Settlement Stipulation) and the 2023 Settlement Stipulation are each described in Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters" to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report. The 2023 Settlement Stipulation modifies the 2018 Settlement Stipulation in part. The 2023 Settlement Stipulation includes provisions for the accelerated amortization of ADITC to help achieve a minimum percent Idaho ROE. 
 
 Based on its estimate of full-year 2024 Idaho ROE, in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Idaho Power recorded million and million, respectively, in additional ADITC amortization under the 2023 Settlement Stipulation. Accordingly, at September 30, 2024, approximately million of additional ADITC remained available for 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 and million, respectively, of additional ADITC amortization during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, based on its then-current estimate of full-year 2023 Idaho ROE. 
 
 Power Cost Adjustment Mechanisms 
 
 In both its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions, Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms address the volatility of power supply costs and provide for annual adjustments to the rates charged to its retail customers. The power cost adjustment mechanisms compare Idaho Power's actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less wholesale energy sales) against net power supply costs being recovered in Idaho Power's retail rates. Under the power cost adjustment mechanisms, certain differences between actual net power supply costs incurred by Idaho Power and costs being recovered in retail rates are recorded as a deferred charge or credit on the balance sheet for future recovery or refund. The power supply costs deferred primarily result from changes in contracted power purchase prices and volumes, changes in wholesale market prices and transaction volumes, fuel prices, and the levels of Idaho Power's own generation. 
 
 In May 2024, the IPUC issued an order approving a million net decrease in PCA revenues, effective for the PCA collection period from June 1, 2024, to May 31, 2025. The net decrease in PCA revenues reflects forecasted improved hydropower generation during the April 2024 to March 2025 PCA deferral period. 
 
 In May 2024, the OPUC approved a settlement stipulation between Idaho Power and intervening parties for its APCU in Oregon. The APCU includes both an October update and a March forecast. The results of the October update are reflected as an update to base rates and the results of the March forecast are reflected as an update to APCU rates. The settlement resulted in an overall rate decrease of million effective June 1, 2024. 
 
 Idaho Fixed Cost Adjustment Mechanism 
 
 The FCA mechanism, applicable to Idaho residential and small commercial customers, is designed to remove a portion of Idaho Power s financial disincentive to invest in energy efficiency programs by separating (or decoupling) the recovery of fixed costs from the variable kilowatt-hour charge and linking it instead to a set amount per customer. Under Idaho Power's current rate design, Idaho Power recovers a portion of fixed costs through the variable kilowatt-hour charge, which may result in over-collection or under-collection of fixed costs. To return over-collection to customers or to collect under-collection from customers, the FCA mechanism allows Idaho Power to accrue, or defer, the difference between the authorized fixed-cost recovery amount per customer and the actual fixed costs per customer recovered by Idaho Power during the year. The IPUC has discretion to cap the annual increase in the FCA recovery at percent of base revenue, with any excess deferred for collection in a subsequent year. In May 2024, the IPUC issued an order approving an million increase in recovery from the FCA from million to million for the 2023 FCA deferral, with new rates effective for the period from June 1, 2024, to May 31, 2025.

 Alternative Revenue Programs and Other Revenues 
 
 While revenues from contracts with customers make up most of Idaho Power s revenues, the IPUC has authorized the use of an additional regulatory mechanism, the FCA mechanism, which may increase or decrease tariff-based customer rates. The FCA mechanism is described in Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters."

 million in aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds, secured medium-term notes, Series M, maturing on August 15, 2034. 
 
 Idaho Power's issuance of long-term indebtedness is subject to the approval of the IPUC, OPUC, and WPSC. In February and March 2024, Idaho Power received orders from the IPUC, OPUC, and WPSC authorizing the company to issue and sell from time to time up to billion in aggregate principal amount of debt securities and first mortgage bonds, subject to conditions specified in the orders. Authority from the IPUC is effective through December 31, 2026, subject to extensions upon request to the IPUC. The OPUC's and WPSC's orders do not impose a time limitation for issuances, but the OPUC order does impose a number of other conditions, including a requirement that the interest rates for the debt securities or first mortgage bonds fall within either (a) designated spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury rates or (b) a maximum interest rate limit of percent. At September 30, 2024, million remained available for debt issuance under the regulatory orders.

 shares of common stock using original issuances of shares. IDACORP granted restricted stock unit awards to employees and issued shares of common stock pursuant to the IDACORP, Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentive and Compensation Plan, including shares of common stock issued to members of the board of directors. IDACORP issued shares of common stock pursuant to its IDACORP, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2024, IDACORP instructed the plan administrator of the IDACORP, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan to use original issuance of common stock from IDACORP, as opposed to market purchases of IDACORP common stock, to acquire shares of IDACORP common stock for the plan. However, IDACORP may determine at any time to resume market purchases of common stock under the plan. As directed by IDACORP, the plan administrator of the Idaho Power Company Employee Savings Plan used market purchases of IDACORP common stock to acquire shares of IDACORP common stock for the plan. 
 
 At-the-Market Offering Program: On May 20, 2024, IDACORP entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (EDA) pursuant to which it may issue, offer, and sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate gross sales price of million of shares of its common stock through an at-the-market offering program, which includes the ability to enter into FSAs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, IDACORP did issue common stock, nor did it enter into any FSAs, pursuant to the EDA. 
 
 Equity Forward Sale Agreements: On November 7, 2023, IDACORP announced a registered public offering of shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share, for an aggregate amount of million. In conjunction with this offering, IDACORP granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to additional shares, which was subsequently exercised in full on November 8, 2023, for an additional aggregate amount of million. The shares were sold by IDACORP to the underwriters under FSAs which provide for settlement on dates to be specified

 On May 14, 2024, IDACORP partially settled the FSAs with physical delivery of shares of common stock to the counterparty in exchange for cash of million. At September 30, 2024, IDACORP could have settled the remainder of the FSAs with physical delivery of shares of common stock to the counterparty in exchange for cash of million. Alternatively, the remainder of the FSAs could have also been settled at September 30, 2024, with delivery of approximately million of cash or approximately shares of common stock to the counterparty, if IDACORP had elected to net cash or net share settle, respectively. 
 
 For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately and incremental shares, respectively, were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share related to the securities under the FSAs. See Note 7 - "Earnings Per Share" for additional information concerning IDACORP's diluted earnings per share. 
 
 Idaho Power Common Stock 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, IDACORP contributed million of additional capital to Idaho Power. additional shares of Idaho Power common stock were issued. 
 
 Restrictions on Dividends 
 
 Idaho Power s ability to pay dividends on its common stock held by IDACORP and IDACORP s ability to pay dividends on its common stock are limited to the extent payment of such dividends would violate the covenants in their respective credit facilities or Idaho Power s Statement of Policy and Code of Conduct. A covenant under IDACORP s credit facility and Idaho Power s credit facility requires IDACORP and Idaho Power to maintain leverage ratios of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization, as defined therein, of no more than percent at the end of each fiscal quarter. At September 30, 2024, the leverage ratios for IDACORP and Idaho Power were percent and percent, respectively. Based on these restrictions, IDACORP s and Idaho Power s dividends were limited to billion and billion, respectively, at September 30, 2024. There are additional facility covenants, subject to exceptions, that prohibit or restrict the sale or disposition of property without consent and any agreements restricting dividend payments to IDACORP and Idaho Power from any material subsidiary. At September 30, 2024, IDACORP and Idaho Power were in compliance with those covenants. 
 
 Idaho Power s Statement of Policy and Code of Conduct relating to transactions between and among Idaho Power, IDACORP, and other affiliates, which was approved by the IPUC in April 2008, provides that Idaho Power will not pay any dividends to IDACORP that will reduce Idaho Power s common equity capital below percent of its total adjusted capital without IPUC approval. At September 30, 2024, Idaho Power's common equity capital was percent of its total adjusted capital. Further, Idaho Power must obtain approval from the OPUC before it can directly or indirectly loan funds or issue notes or give credit on its books to IDACORP. 
 
 Idaho Power s articles of incorporation contain restrictions on the payment of dividends on its common stock if preferred stock dividends are in arrears. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power has preferred stock outstanding. 
 
 In addition to contractual restrictions on the amount and payment of dividends, the Federal Power Act prohibits the payment of dividends from "capital accounts." The term "capital account" is undefined in the Federal Power Act or its regulations, but

 million over the - to -year terms of the contracts; 
 an energy and capacity market purchase agreement with an energy marketer giving Idaho Power the right to acquire MW on a daily basis during summer months, subject to regulatory approval, which increased Idaho Power's contractual purchase obligations by approximately million over the -year term of the contract commencing in June 2026; 
 an agreement in July 2024 to acquire and own MW of battery storage assets, which increased Idaho Power's contractual purchase obligations by approximately million. The battery storage assets are scheduled to be online in the spring of 2026. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Idaho Power made payments of million related to this obligation; and 
 a firm transportation capacity agreement in September 2024 with a natural gas transporter, which increased Idaho Power's contractual purchase obligations by approximately million over the -year term of the contract commencing in November 2024. Concurrently with this agreement, Idaho Power extended the term of several existing firm transportation capacity agreements with the natural gas transporter, which increased Idaho Power's contractual purchase obligations by approximately million over the -year term of the extensions commencing in May 2031. 
 
 In October 2024, Idaho Power entered into one new non-PURPA-qualifying solar facility power purchase agreement with a scheduled online date of December 2027, the output of which Idaho Power plans to sell to a customer under its Clean Energy Your Way program, and one new non-PURPA-qualifying wind facility power purchase agreement with a scheduled online date of June 2027. Also, in October 2024, Idaho Power entered into a commitment to acquire and own a MW wind facility, with milestone payments due through its expected completion in June 2027. The agreements signed in October 2024 collectively increased Idaho Power's contractual purchase obligations by approximately billion over the - to -year terms of the contracts. The wind facility agreements are subject to counterparty board approval. 
 
 Except as disclosed in this Note 8, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's contractual obligations, outside the ordinary course of business, did not change materially from the amounts disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the 2023 Annual Report.

 million at September 30, 2024, representing IERCo's one-third share of BCC's total reclamation obligation of million. BCC has a reclamation trust fund set aside specifically for the purpose of paying these reclamation costs. At September 30, 2024, the value of BCC's reclamation trust fund exceeded WDEQ's guarantee requirement for the total reclamation obligation. BCC periodically assesses the adequacy of the reclamation trust fund and its estimate of future reclamation costs. To ensure that the reclamation trust fund maintains adequate reserves, BCC has the ability to, and does, add a per-ton surcharge to coal sales to the Jim Bridger plant. Because of the existence of the fund and the ability to apply a per-ton surcharge, the estimated fair value of this guarantee is minimal. 
 
 IDACORP and Idaho Power enter into financial agreements and power purchase and sale agreements that include indemnification provisions relating to various forms of claims or liabilities that may arise from the transactions contemplated by these agreements. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in the indemnification provisions and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnification provisions cannot be reasonably estimated. IDACORP and Idaho Power periodically evaluate the likelihood of incurring costs under such indemnities based on their historical experience and the evaluation of the specific indemnities. As of September 30, 2024, management believe the likelihood is remote that IDACORP or Idaho Power would be required to perform under such indemnification provisions or otherwise incur any significant losses with respect to such indemnification obligations. Neither IDACORP nor Idaho Power has recorded any liability on their respective condensed consolidated balance sheets with respect to these indemnification obligations. 

9. CONTINGENCIES 

In connection with its utility operations, Idaho Power is subject to claims by individuals, entities, and governmental agencies for damages for alleged personal injury, property damage, and economic losses, relating to the company s provision of electric service, the operation of its power supply, transmission, and distribution facilities, and other aspects of its business. Some of those claims relate to electrical contacts, service quality, property damage, and wildfires. In recent years, utilities in the western United States have been subject to significant liability for personal injury, loss of life, property damage, trespass, and economic losses, and in some cases, punitive damages and criminal charges, associated with wildfires that originated from utility property, most commonly transmission and distribution lines. Idaho Power has also regularly received claims by governmental agencies and private landowners for damages for fires allegedly originating from Idaho Power s transmission and distribution system. As of the date of this report, the companies believe that resolution of existing claims will not have a material adverse effect on their respective condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Idaho Power actively monitors any pending or potential environmental regulations and executive orders related to environmental matters that may have a significant impact on its future operations. Given uncertainties regarding the outcome, timing, and compliance plans for these environmental matters, Idaho Power is unable to estimate the financial impact of any such regulations and orders.

 Idaho Power has no minimum contribution requirement to its defined benefit pension plan in 2024, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Idaho Power contributed million in a continued effort to balance the regulatory collection of these expenditures with the amount and timing of contributions, as well as to mitigate the cost of being in an underfunded position. The primary impact of pension contributions is on the timing of cash flows, as the timing of cost recovery lags behind contributions.

 Credit Risk 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Idaho Power did not have material credit risk exposure from financial instruments, including derivatives. Idaho Power monitors credit risk exposure through reviews of counterparty credit quality, corporate-wide counterparty credit exposure, and corporate-wide counterparty concentration levels. Idaho Power manages these risks by establishing credit and concentration limits on transactions with counterparties and requiring contractual guarantees, cash deposits, bonds, or letters of credit from counterparties or their affiliates, as deemed necessary. Idaho Power s physical power contracts are commonly under WSPP, Inc. agreements, physical gas contracts are usually under North American Energy

While reading this MD A, please refer to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of IDACORP and Idaho Power. Also refer to "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this MD A and elsewhere in this report. This discussion updates the MD A included in the 2023 Annual Report, and should also be read in conjunction with the information in that report. The results of operations for an interim period generally will not be indicative of results for the full year, particularly in light of the seasonality of Idaho Power's sales volumes, as discussed below. 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
 IDACORP is a holding company formed in 1998 whose principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power. IDACORP s common stock is listed and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "IDA". Idaho Power is an electric utility whose rates and other matters are regulated by the IPUC, OPUC, and FERC. Idaho Power generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to customers in its Idaho and Oregon service areas, as well as from the wholesale sale and transmission of electricity. Idaho Power experiences its highest retail energy sales during the summer irrigation and cooling season, with a lower peak in the winter that generally results from heating demand. 
 
 Idaho Power is the parent of IERCo, a joint-owner of BCC, which mines and supplies coal to the Jim Bridger plant owned in part by Idaho Power. IDACORP s other notable subsidiaries include IFS, an investor in affordable housing and other real estate tax credit investments, and Ida-West, an operator of small PURPA-qualifying hydropower generation projects. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 
 Management's Outlook and Company Objectives 
 
 In the 2023 Annual Report, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's management included a summary of their business objectives for the companies for 2024 and beyond, under the heading "Executive Overview" in the MD A. As of the date of this report, management's outlook and strategy remain consistent with that discussion, as updated by some of the discussion in this MD A. Some notable developments that have occurred since that report include the following: 
 
 Idaho Power continues to focus on timely recovery of costs and earning a reasonable return on investment. In September 2024, the OPUC approved three partial settlement stipulations related to Idaho Power's Oregon general rate case filing that it made in December 2023. In addition, on May 31, 2024, Idaho Power filed a limited-issue rate case in Idaho. These filings are described more fully in Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 Idaho Power continues to expect positive customer growth in its service area. During the first nine months of 2024, Idaho Power's customer count grew by over 12,500 customers, and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, the customer growth rate was 2.6 percent. Idaho Power reached a new summer peak demand of 3,793 MW on July 22, 2024. The prior highest summer peak demand was 3,751 MW, reached in June 2021. 
 In connection with its resource planning process, Idaho Power has updated the preliminary estimate of load growth that it intends to use for its 2025 IRP. While subject to adjustment, Idaho Power currently plans to use a 7.7 percent annual rate of growth in retail sales volumes over the 2025-2029 time period, representative of anticipated continued strong growth in Idaho Power s service area across the residential and industrial customer classes. 
 In September 2024, IDACORP's board of directors approved an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend on IDACORP s common stock from 0.83 per share to 0.86 per share, as a part of a 187 percent increase in quarterly dividends approved over the last thirteen years. 
 Idaho Power's estimate of capital expenditures from 2024 to 2028, inclusive of amounts spent to-date in 2024, have increased to the range of 5.4 billion to 6.1 billion. Part of the increase is driven by Idaho Power's need to acquire additional power supply resources to meet growing demand. To help meet those growing capacity and energy needs in 2026 and beyond, 
 in March 2024, as part of a competitive RFP process, Idaho Power entered into an energy and capacity market purchase agreement with an energy marketer for the right to acquire 200 MW on a daily basis during summer months beginning in 2026 for a term of at least five years; 
 in April 2024 and July 2024, Idaho Power entered into agreements for the acquisition of 200 MW of new battery storage assets with an expected in-service date in June 2026; 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 in October 2024, Idaho Power entered into a solar facility power purchase agreement with a scheduled online date of December 2027, the output of which Idaho Power plans to sell to a customer under its Clean Energy Your Way program, and a 300 MW wind facility power purchase agreement with a scheduled online date of June 2027; and 
 in October 2024, Idaho Power entered into a commitment to acquire and own a 300 MW wind facility expected to be completed in June 2027. 
 Idaho Power also has in-process RFPs under Oregon's competitive bidding rules for resources intended to be in-service in 2028 or later, to address future additional energy and capacity deficits. 
 
 Summary of Financial Results 
 
 The following is a summary of Idaho Power's net income, net income attributable to IDACORP, and IDACORP's earnings per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except earnings per share amounts): 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Idaho Power net income 111,089 103,022 245,779 225,812 Net income attributable to IDACORP, Inc. 113,605 105,264 251,298 229,936 Weighted average outstanding shares diluted 53,485 50,805 52,179 50,762 IDACORP, Inc. earnings per diluted share 2.12 2.07 4.82 4.53 
 
 The table below provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to IDACORP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, from the same periods in 2023 (items are in millions and are before related income tax impact unless otherwise noted):

 Net Income - Third Quarter 2024 
 
 IDACORP's net income increased 8.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to higher net income at Idaho Power. 
 
 The net increase in retail revenues per MWh, net of associated power supply costs and power cost adjustment and FCA mechanisms, increased operating income by 19.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023.

Table of Contents 

 This benefit was due primarily to an overall increase in Idaho base rates, effective January 1, 2024, per the terms of the 2023 Settlement Stipulation. For more information on the 2023 Settlement Stipulation, see Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters" to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 At Idaho Power, customer growth increased operating income by 7.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, as the number of Idaho Power customers grew by approximately 16,500, or 2.6 percent, during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. Usage per retail customer increased operating income by 3.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023. While there was an increase in usage per customer for most retail customer classes, usage per residential and irrigation customers were the primary contributors. Higher temperatures and lower precipitation compared with the third quarter of 2023 led residential customers to use more energy for cooling purposes and irrigation customers to run irrigation pumps more frequently. 
 
 Total other O M expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were 20.3 million higher than the third quarter of 2023, partially related to approximately 4 million of increased pension-related expenses and an approximate 6 million increase in wildfire mitigation program and related insurance expenses. Both of these increases in expenses were partially offset by increases in retail revenues, as more costs are now recovered in base rates pursuant to the 2023 Settlement Stipulation. However, revenues related to these increased costs are not collected at the same rate that the expenses are incurred in the interim periods throughout the year due to the impact of volume-based rates and associated revenues. Inflationary pressures on labor-related costs also contributed to the increase in other O M expenses. These increases in other O M expenses were partially offset by a 2.9 million deferral of other O M expenses related to the conversion from coal to natural gas for two units at the Jim Bridger plant. 
 
 Depreciation expense increased 5.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to an increase in plant-in-service. 
 
 Other changes in operating revenues and expenses, net, increased operating income by 3.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to a decrease in net power supply expenses that were not deferred for future recovery in rates through Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms, which increased other changes in operating revenues and expenses, net, compared with the same period in 2023. More moderate and less volatile wholesale natural gas and power market prices in the western United States and increased wholesale energy sales decreased Idaho Power's net power supply expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Non-operating expense, net, decreased 2.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023. AFUDC increased in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, as the average construction work in progress balance was higher, and interest income increased due to higher average cash balances and interest rates. These increases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense on long-term debt in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to an increase in long-term debt balances. Also offsetting the increases, Idaho Power's earnings from its investment in BCC decreased 2.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, due to a decrease in the amount included and recovered in base rates pursuant to the 2023 Settlement Stipulation. 
 
 The increase in income tax expense was principally the result of higher income before income taxes, partially offset by an increase in additional ADITC amortization. Based on Idaho Power's current expectations of full-year 2024 results, Idaho Power recorded 2.5 million of additional ADITC amortization under its Idaho regulatory settlement stipulation during the third quarter of 2024, but recorded no additional ADITC amortization during the same period in 2023. 
 
 Net Income - Year-To-Date 2024 
 
 IDACORP's net income increased 21.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023, due primarily to higher net income at Idaho Power. 
 
 The net increase in retail revenues per MWh, net of associated power supply costs and power cost adjustment and FCA mechanisms, increased operating income by 44 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023. This benefit was due primarily to an overall increase in Idaho base rates, effective January 1, 2024, per the terms of the 2023 Settlement Stipulation. 
 
 At Idaho Power, customer growth increased operating income by 17.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023. The benefit from customer growth was partially offset by a decrease in usage per retail customer of 0.8 million, as higher usage per customer in the second and third quarters of 2024 was more than offset by lower usage per customer in the first quarter of 2024. Overall, usage per customer was relatively flat for most customer classes.

 Transmission wheeling-related revenues, net of PCA impacts, decreased 3.0 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023. Effective January 1, 2024, financial settlement of transmission line losses are subject to the PCA mechanism, as approved in the 2023 Settlement Stipulation, resulting in a smaller contribution of those revenues to net income compared with the first nine months of 2023 when the financial settlement of transmission line losses was not subject to the PCA mechanism. 
 
 Total other O M expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were 47.9 million higher than the first nine months of 2023, partially related to approximately 13 million of increased pension-related expenses and an approximate 22 million increase in wildfire mitigation program and related insurance expenses. Both of these increases in expenses were partially offset by increases in retail revenues, as more costs are now recovered in base rates pursuant to the 2023 Settlement Stipulation; however, revenues related to these increased costs are not collected at the same rate that the expenses are incurred in the interim periods throughout the year. On a full-year basis for 2024, Idaho Power expects other O M expenses related to its employee pension plans and its wildfire mitigation program and related insurance to increase approximately 18 million and 30 million, respectively, compared with 2023. Inflationary pressures on labor-related costs also contributed to the increase in other O M expenses. These increases were partially offset by a 9.1 million increase in deferral of other O M expenses related to the conversion from coal to natural gas for two units at the Jim Bridger plant. 
 
 Depreciation expense increased 21.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023 due primarily to an increase in plant-in-service. 
 
 Other changes in operating revenues and expenses, net, increased operating income by 21.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023, due partially to a decrease in net power supply expenses that were not deferred for future recovery in rates through Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms, which increased other changes in operating revenues and expenses, net, compared with the same period in 2023. More moderate wholesale natural gas and power market prices in the western United States and increased wholesale energy sales decreased Idaho Power's net power supply expenses in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023. The change was also partially due to the timing of recording and adjusting regulatory accruals and deferrals. 
 
 Non-operating expense, net, decreased 0.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023. AFUDC increased in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023, as the average construction work in progress balance was higher. In addition, interest income increased due to higher average cash balances and interest rates compared with the same period in 2023. These increases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense on long-term debt in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023, due primarily to an increase in long-term debt balances. Also offsetting the increases, Idaho Power's earnings from its investment in BCC decreased 5.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023, due to a decrease in the amount included and recovered in base rates pursuant to the 2023 Settlement Stipulation. 
 
 The increase in income tax expense was primarily the result of higher income before income taxes, partially offset by an increase in additional ADITC amortization. Based on Idaho Power's current expectations of full-year 2024 results, Idaho Power recorded 22.5 million of additional ADITC amortization under its Idaho regulatory settlement stipulation during the first nine months of 2024, but recorded 7.5 million of additional ADITC amortization during the same period in 2023. 
 
 Overview of General Factors and Trends Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
 IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition are affected by a number of factors and trends, and the impact of those factors and trends is discussed in more detail below in this MD A. To provide context for the discussion elsewhere in this report, some of the more notable factors and trends are as follows: 
 
 Regulation of Rates and Cost Recovery; Rate Case Filings : The prices that Idaho Power is authorized to charge for its electric and transmission service are a critical factor in determining IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. Those rates are established by state regulatory commissions and the FERC and are intended to allow Idaho Power an opportunity to recover its expenses and earn a reasonable return on investment. Idaho Power is focused on timely recovery of its costs through filings with its regulators, working to put in place innovative regulatory mechanisms, and prudent management of expenses and investments. The 2023 Settlement Stipulation provides for the accelerated amortization of ADITC, if necessary, to help achieve a minimum 9.12 percent Idaho ROE. The 2023 Settlement Stipulation also provides for the potential sharing between Idaho Power and its Idaho customers of Idaho-jurisdictional earnings in excess of a 9.6 percent Idaho ROE. The specific terms of the 2023 Settlement Stipulation are described in Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters" to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report.

To address the regulatory lag in recovery of costs primarily associated with Idaho Power s current and anticipated significant infrastructure investments, including those that are intended to help meet projected near-term capacity deficits, Idaho Power filed a limited-issue rate case in Idaho on May 31, 2024. Idaho Power expects the processing of this limited-issue rate case in Idaho will span at least seven months before new rates would be in effect. In December 2023, Idaho Power made a general rate case filing in Oregon, which is described more fully in Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. In September 2024 the OPUC approved the 2024 Oregon Settlement Stipulations related to Idaho Power's Oregon general rate case filing. 
 
 Rate Base Growth and Infrastructure Investment : The rates established by the IPUC, OPUC, and FERC are determined with the intent to provide an opportunity for Idaho Power to recover authorized operating expenses and depreciation and earn a reasonable return on rate base. Rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost (net of accumulated depreciation) of utility plant in service and certain other assets, subject to various adjustments for deferred income taxes and other items. Over time, rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation of utility plant and write-offs as authorized by the IPUC and OPUC. Idaho Power is pursuing significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure in an effort to maintain system reliability, ensure an adequate supply of electricity, and provide service to new customers, including major ongoing transmission projects such as the B2H and GWW projects. Idaho Power's existing hydropower and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and equipment replacement, and the company is undertaking a significant relicensing effort for the HCC, its largest hydropower generation resource. Idaho Power is seeking timely inclusion of completed capital projects into rate base as part of the 2024 Idaho Limited-Issue Rate Case and intends to continue to do so in future general rate cases or other appropriate regulatory proceedings. 
 
 Idaho Power expects its capital expenditures on infrastructure investments in the next five years or more will be considerable as it works to address projected energy and capacity deficits. For more information about forecasted capital expenditures and expected rate base growth, see the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD A. 
 
 Economic Conditions and Loads : Economic conditions impact consumer demand for energy, revenues, collectability of accounts, the volume of wholesale energy sales, and the need to construct and improve infrastructure, purchase power, and implement programs to meet customer load demands. In recent years, Idaho Power has seen significant growth in the number of customers in its service area. Over the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, Idaho Power's customer count grew by 2.6 percent. While recessionary or volatile economic conditions could slow the rate of customer growth, Idaho Power expects its number of customers and, to a greater extent, its load due to anticipated commercial and industrial customer growth, to increase in the foreseeable future. 
 
 Idaho Power is preparing its 2025 IRP, its 20-year forecast of load and power supply resource options. Included in the below table are Idaho Power's preliminary load forecast assumptions the company anticipates using in the 2025 IRP as of the date of this report, and for comparison purposes, the analogous average annual growth rates Idaho Power used in the prior two IRPs. 
 
 5-Year Forecasted Annual Growth Rate 20-Year Forecasted Annual Growth Rate Retail Sales (Billed MWh) Annual Peak (Peak Demand) Retail Sales (Billed MWh) Annual Peak (Peak Demand) 2025 IRP (preliminary) 7.7 4.8 2.1 1.6 2023 IRP 5.5 3.7 2.1 1.8 2021 IRP 2.6 2.1 1.4 1.4 
 
 The 2025 preliminary IRP assumptions included in the above table do not include two potential significant large energy-intensive projects in the 5-year forecasted annual growth rate, as Idaho Power only recently delivered the results of its infrastructure construction and generation studies and associated cost estimates to those two customers. As of the date of this report, neither customer has executed an agreement to commence construction of electrical facilities. However, were either potential customer to execute an agreement, it would increase Idaho Power's forecast of retail sales growth. 
 
 Customer growth has contributed to increases in peak loads experienced in recent years. For example, Idaho Power's highest all-time winter peak demand of 2,719 MW occurred on January 16, 2024, and on July 22, 2024, Idaho Power reached a new all-time summer peak demand of 3,793 MW. Idaho Power's prior all-time summer peak demand was 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 3,751 MW, set in June 2021. Idaho Power believes that existing and sustained growth in customers, load, and peak demand for electricity, along with changes in the regional transmission markets that have constrained the availability of transmission outside Idaho Power s service area to import energy during peak load periods, require Idaho Power to increase its investment in capacity resources, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. This includes the B2H and GWW transmission projects, along with other capacity, energy, and transmission resource procurements, described in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD A. 
 
 Weather Conditions : Weather and agricultural growing conditions have a significant impact on Idaho Power's energy sales. Relatively low winter and high summer temperatures result in greater energy use for heating and cooling, respectively. During the agricultural growing season, which in large part occurs during the second and third quarters of each year, irrigation customers use electricity to operate irrigation pumps, and weather conditions, such as a prolonged winter, can impact the timing and extent of use of those pumps. Idaho Power also has tiered rates and seasonal rates, which contribute to increased revenues during higher-load periods, most notably during the third quarter of each year when overall customer demand is highest. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of weather on sales of energy to residential and small commercial customers is mitigated through the FCA mechanism, which is described in Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 Further, as Idaho Power's hydropower facilities comprise over one-half of Idaho Power's nameplate generation capacity, precipitation levels impact the mix of Idaho Power's generation resources. When hydropower generation decreases, Idaho Power must rely on more expensive generation sources and purchased power. When favorable hydropower generating conditions exist for Idaho Power, they also may exist for other Pacific Northwest hydropower facility operators, lowering regional wholesale market prices and impacting the revenue Idaho Power receives from wholesale energy sales. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of this volatility is addressed through the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms, which mitigate in large part the impact on earnings. For 2024, Idaho Power expects generation from its hydropower resources to be in the range of 7.0 million to 7.5 million MWh, compared with actual generation of 6.5 million MWh in 2023 and a 30-year average annual total of approximately 7.6 million MWh. 
 
 Mitigation of Impact of Fuel and Purchased Power Expense : In addition to hydropower generation, Idaho Power relies significantly on natural gas and coal to fuel its generation facilities, long-term power purchase agreements (including PURPA agreements), and power purchases in the wholesale markets. Fuel costs are impacted by electricity sales volumes, the terms and conditions of contracts for fuel, Idaho Power's generation capacity, the availability of hydropower generation resources, transmission capacity, energy market prices, and Idaho Power's hedging program for managing fuel costs. Purchased power costs are impacted by the terms and conditions of contracts for purchased power, the rate of expansion of alternative energy generation sources such as wind or solar energy, generation resource maintenance outages, wholesale energy market prices, transmission availability, and the outcome of Idaho Power's hedging programs. The Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms mitigate in large part the potential adverse earnings impacts to Idaho Power of fluctuations in power supply costs. However, collection from customers or return to customers of most of the difference between actual power supply costs compared with those included in retail rates is deferred to a subsequent period, which can affect Idaho Power s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from or returned to customers. 
 
 Regulatory and Environmental Compliance Costs; Coal Plant Retirements : Idaho Power is subject to extensive federal and state laws, policies, and regulations, as well as regulatory actions and audits by agencies and quasi-governmental agencies, including the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Compliance with these requirements directly influences Idaho Power's operating environment and affects Idaho Power's operating costs. Moreover, environmental laws and regulations may increase the cost of constructing new facilities, may increase the cost of operating generation plants, may require that Idaho Power install additional pollution control devices at existing generating plants, may result in penalties for non-compliance, even where inadvertent, or may require that Idaho Power curtail or cease operating certain generation plants. Idaho Power expects to spend significant amounts on environmental compliance and controls for the foreseeable future. Due to economic factors in part associated with the costs of compliance with environmental regulation, Idaho Power accelerated the retirement date of its North Valmy plant, ceasing coal-fired operations at one unit in 2019 and planning to cease its participation in coal-fired operations at the remaining unit by year-end 2025. Idaho Power's jointly-owned coal plant in Boardman, Oregon, ceased operations as planned in October 2020. In 2022, the IPUC approved Idaho Power's request to allow the coal-related assets at the Jim Bridger plant to be fully depreciated and recovered by end-of-year 2030. Idaho Power's 2023 IRP identified a preferred resource portfolio and action plan that includes the conversion from coal to natural gas of two units at the Jim Bridger plant in 2024, the two units at the North Valmy plant in 2026, and the remaining two units at the Jim Bridger plant in 2030. Units 1 and 2 at 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 the Jim Bridger plant were successfully converted to natural gas in the second quarter of 2024. In July 2024, Idaho Power executed an agreement with its co-owner to facilitate the planned conversion of the two units at the North Valmy plant from coal to natural gas by mid-2026. 
 
 Water Management and Relicensing of Hydropower Projects : Because of Idaho Power's reliance on stream flow in the Snake River and its tributaries, Idaho Power participates in numerous proceedings and venues that may affect its water rights, seeking to preserve the long-term availability of its rights for its hydropower projects. Also, Idaho Power is involved in renewing its long-term federal licenses for the HCC, its largest hydropower generation source, and for American Falls, its second largest hydropower generation source. Given the number of parties involved, Idaho Power's relicensing costs have been and are expected to continue to be substantial. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power cannot determine the ultimate terms of, and costs associated with, any resulting long-term licenses for the HCC or American Falls hydropower facilities. 
 
 Wildfire Mitigation Efforts : In recent years, the western United States has experienced an increasing number of wildfires of unprecedented severity. A variety of factors have contributed to this trend including climate change, increased wildland-urban interfaces, historical land management practices, and overall wildland and forest health. Idaho Power is taking a proactive approach to wildfire risk in its service area and transmission corridors. Idaho Power has adopted a WMP that outlines actions Idaho Power is taking or is working to implement to reduce wildfire risk and to strengthen the resiliency of its transmission and distribution system to wildfires. Idaho Power's approach to achieve these objectives includes identifying areas subject to elevated risk; system hardening programs, vegetation management, and field personnel practices to mitigate wildfire risk; incorporating current and forecasted weather and field conditions into operational practices; public safety power shutoff protocols; and evaluating the performance and effectiveness of the strategies identified in the WMP through metrics and monitoring. Idaho Power has a regulatory mechanism that allows the company to defer, for future amortization, the Idaho jurisdictional share of certain actual incremental O M expenses necessary to implement the WMP. In January 2024, the OPUC authorized Idaho Power's request to defer the Oregon jurisdictional share of costs associated with the WMP for the 12-month period beginning December 29, 2022, and ending on December 28, 2023. The WMP regulatory deferrals are described in more detail in Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters" to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report.

 (1) Heating and cooling degree-days are common measures used in the utility industry to analyze the demand for electricity and indicate when a customer would use electricity for heating and cooling. A degree-day measures how much the average daily temperature varies from 65 degrees. Each degree of temperature above 65 degrees is counted as one cooling degree-day, and each degree of temperature below 65 degrees is counted as one heating degree-day. 
 (2) Normal heating degree-days and cooling degree-days elements are, by convention, the arithmetic mean of the elements computed over 30 consecutive years. The normal amounts are the sum of the monthly normal amounts. These normal amounts are computed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
 
 Sales Volume and Generation: Retail sales volumes increased 4 percent and 3 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2023, primarily due to growth in the number of Idaho Power customers and, in the third quarter of 2024, an increase in usage per residential and irrigation customers. The number of Idaho Power's customers grew by 2.6 percent over the prior twelve months, and higher temperatures in the third quarter of 2024 compared with last year's more moderate third quarter weather led irrigation customers to run irrigation pumps more frequently, contributing to the higher volumes. 
 
 Total system generation increased 15 percent for the third quarter and 19 percent in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the same periods in 2023, which consists of an increase in hydropower generation, steam generation, and natural gas generation. For more information on the changes in generation, see the "Operating Expenses" section below in this MD A. 
 
 The financial impacts of fluctuations in wholesale energy sales, purchased power, fuel expense, and other power supply-related expenses are addressed in Idaho Power's Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms, which are described below in "Power Cost Adjustment Mechanisms."

 Operating Revenues 
 
 Retail Revenues: The table below presents Idaho Power s retail revenues (in thousands) and MWh sales volumes (in thousands) for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the number of customers as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Retail revenues: Residential (includes (6,193), 5,583, (8,982), and 20,170, respectively, related to the FCA) (1)

 (1) The FCA mechanism is an alternative revenue program in the Idaho jurisdiction and does not represent revenue from contracts with customers. 
 (2) The IPUC allows Idaho Power to recover a portion of the AFUDC on construction work in progress related to the HCC relicensing process, even though the relicensing process is not yet complete and the costs have not been moved to utility plant in service. Idaho Power is collecting approximately 8.8 million annually in the Idaho jurisdiction but is deferring revenue recognition of the amounts collected until the license is issued and the accumulated license costs approved for recovery are placed in service. 
 
 Changes in rates, changes in customer demand, customer growth, and changes in FCA mechanism revenues are the primary reasons for fluctuations in retail revenues from period to period. The primary influences on customer demand of electricity are weather, economic conditions, and energy efficiency. Extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating, while moderate temperatures decrease sales. Precipitation levels and the timing of precipitation during the agricultural growing season also affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps. Rates are also seasonally adjusted, providing for higher rates during peak load periods, and residential customer rates are tiered, providing for higher rates based on higher levels of usage. The seasonal and tiered rate structures contribute to seasonal fluctuations in revenues and earnings. 
 
 Retail revenues increased 27.4 million and 85.7 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2023. The factors affecting retail revenues during the periods are discussed below. 
 
 Rates : Average customer rates, excluding amounts related to the power cost adjustment mechanisms, increased retail revenues by 34.4 million and 74.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023, due primarily to the January 1, 2024 rate increase for Idaho Power's retail customers under the 2023 Settlement Stipulation. Customer rates also include the collection from customers of amounts related to the power cost adjustment mechanisms, which decreased revenues by 10.8 million and increased revenues by 11.8 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023. The amount collected from customers in rates under the power cost adjustment mechanisms has relatively little effect on operating income as a corresponding amount is recorded as expense in the same period it is collected through rates. FCA revenue accrued in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 12.2 million and 30.2 million compared with the same periods in 2023, respectively, as the 2023 Settlement Stipulation moved a greater portion of recovery of fixed costs into customer base rates. 
 Customers : Customer growth increased retail revenues by 12.0 million and 28.5 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023. 
 Usage : Higher usage (on a per customer basis) in most customer classes increased retail revenues by 4.0 million and 1.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023. Warmer and drier summer weather led to increased usage per residential customer for cooling and increased usage per irrigation customer for pump irrigation during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, usage per residential customer decreased, as more moderate temperatures from January through May 2024 led residential customers to use less energy for heating purposes. However, warmer weather during the summer of 2024 led to an increase in energy usage per residential customer for cooling purposes, and an increase in energy usage per irrigation customer, which more than offset the decrease in usage per residential customer from January through May 2024. 
 
 Wholesale Energy Sales: Wholesale energy sales consist primarily of long-term sales contracts, sales of surplus system energy, and sales into the energy imbalance market in the western United States, and do not include derivative transactions. The table below presents Idaho Power s wholesale energy sales for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except for revenue per MWh amounts). 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Wholesale energy revenues 6,946 5,065 65,759 50,461 Wholesale MWh sold 126 171 1,355 697 Wholesale energy revenues per MWh 55.13 29.62 48.53 72.40 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, wholesale energy revenues increased 1.9 million compared with the third quarter of 2023, as higher wholesale market prices more than offset a decrease in volumes sold. Wholesale energy revenues increased 15.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the same period of 2023, as higher wholesale energy sales volumes were partially offset by lower wholesale market prices. Wholesale energy prices were lower during the first nine months of 2024 compared with 2023 as more moderate winter and spring weather resulted in lower demand and lower power prices in the wholesale markets in the region. The financial impacts of fluctuations in wholesale energy sales are largely mitigated by Idaho Power's Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms, which are described below in this section of the MD A under "Power Cost Adjustment Mechanisms." 
 
 Transmission Wheeling-Related Revenues: Transmission wheeling-related revenues decreased 0.7 million, or 3 percent, and 1.6 million, or 3 percent, during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to lower revenue from the financial settlement of transmission line losses as a result of lower power prices in the western United States. Also, Idaho Power's OATT rates were approximately 2 percent lower in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Effective January 1, 2024, financial settlement of transmission line losses are subject to the PCA mechanism, as approved in the 2023 Settlement Stipulation, reducing the potential net income impact of those transmission-related revenues. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Purchased Power: The table below presents Idaho Power s purchased power expenses and volumes for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except for per MWh amounts). 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Purchased power expense 114,578 142,851 321,860 405,404 MWh purchased 1,375 1,798 4,902 5,541 Average cost per MWh 83.33 79.45 65.66 73.16 
 
 Purchased power expense decreased 28.3 million, or 20 percent, and 83.5 million, or 21 percent, during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023. Increased system generation led to a decrease

 in total MWh purchased of 24 percent and 12 percent for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023. 
 
 Fuel Expense: The table below presents Idaho Power s fuel expenses and thermal generation for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except for per MWh amounts).

 (1) "Steam" is composed of expenses and generation from steam plants that are fueled only by coal or by both coal and natural gas. 
 
 The majority of the coal for Idaho Power s jointly-owned plants is purchased through long-term contracts, including purchases from BCC, a one-third owned investment of IERCo. The price of coal from BCC is subject to fluctuations in mine operating expenses, geologic conditions, and production levels. BCC supplies the majority of the coal used by the Jim Bridger plant and BCC does not have significant sales to third parties. Natural gas is mainly purchased on the regional wholesale spot market at published index prices. In addition to commodity (variable) costs, both natural gas and coal expenses include costs that are more fixed in nature for items such as capacity charges, transportation, and fuel handling. Period to period variances in fuel expense per MWh are noticeably impacted by these fixed charges when generation output is substantially different between the periods. 
 
 Fuel expense increased 1.7 million, or 2 percent, and decreased 3.5 million, or 2 percent, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023. In both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, steam and natural gas generation increased to serve load and provide power for wholesale energy sales, compared with the same periods of 2023. The impact of this generation increase on fuel expense was partially offset in the third quarter by lower natural gas market prices and more than offset during the first nine months of 2024 by lower natural gas market prices compared with the same periods of 2023. 
 
 Included in fuel expense are losses and gains on settled financial gas hedges entered into in accordance with Idaho Power's energy risk management policy. For the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, and the first nine months of 2024, losses on financial gas hedges of 18.4 million, 7.9 million, and 43.4 million, respectively, increased natural gas fuel expense, while in the first nine months of 2023 gains on financial gas hedges of 4.2 million reduced natural gas fuel expense. Most of these realized hedging losses and gains are passed on to customers through the power cost adjustment mechanisms described below. 
 
 Power Cost Adjustment Mechanisms: Idaho Power's power supply costs (primarily purchased power and fuel expense, less wholesale energy sales) can vary significantly from year to year. Volatility of power supply costs arises from factors such as weather conditions, wholesale market prices, volumes of power purchased and sold in the wholesale markets, Idaho Power's hydropower and thermal generation volumes and fuel costs, generation plant availability, and retail loads. To address the volatility of power supply costs, Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms in the Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions allow Idaho Power to recover from customers, or refund to customers, most of the fluctuations in power supply costs. In the Idaho jurisdiction, the PCA includes a cost or benefit sharing ratio that allocates the deviations in net power supply expenses between customers (95 percent) and Idaho Power (5 percent), with the exception of PURPA power purchases and demand response program incentives, which are allocated 100 percent to customers. The Idaho deferral period, or PCA year, runs from April 1 through March 31. Amounts deferred or accrued during the PCA year are primarily recovered or refunded during the subsequent June 1 through May 31 period. However, the IPUC directed Idaho Power to spread recovery of the March 31, 2023, PCA deferral balance over a two-year period from June 1, 2023 to May 31, 2025. Because of the power cost adjustment 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 mechanisms, the primary financial impact of power supply cost variations is that cash is paid out but recovery from customers does not occur until a future period, or cash that is collected is refunded to customers in a future period, resulting in fluctuations in operating cash flows from year to year. 
 
 The table that follows presents the components of the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands). 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Idaho power supply cost accrual (deferral) (6,759) (22,131) 26,761 (47,482) Oregon power supply cost accrual 118 2,471 335 Amortization of prior year authorized balances 27,420 28,030 73,065 51,338 Total power cost adjustment (income statement) 20,779 5,899 102,297 4,191 
 
 The power supply accruals (deferrals) represent the portion of the power supply cost fluctuations accrued (deferred) under the power cost adjustment mechanisms. When actual power supply costs are lower than the amount forecasted in power cost adjustment rates, most of the difference is accrued as an increase to a regulatory liability or decrease to a regulatory asset. When actual power supply costs are higher than the amount forecasted in power cost adjustment rates, most of the difference is deferred as an increase to a regulatory asset or decrease to a regulatory liability. During the third quarter of 2024, higher purchased power and fuel costs led to higher actual power supply costs compared with the forecasted amount, which resulted in an increase in the amount of power supply costs deferred by the mechanism. During the first nine months of 2024, purchased power costs led to lower actual power supply costs compared with the forecasted amount, which resulted in an accrual of power supply costs by the mechanism. The amortization of the prior year s balances represents the offset to the amounts being collected or refunded in the current power cost adjustment year that were deferred or accrued in the prior PCA year (the balancing adjustment component of the power cost adjustment mechanism). 
 
 Other O M Expenses: Total other O M expenses increased 20.3 million and 47.9 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023, partially related to approximately 4 million and 13 million, respectively, of increased pension-related expenses and approximately 6 million and 22 million, respectively, of increased wildfire mitigation program and related insurance expenses. Both of these increases in expenses were partially offset by increases in retail revenues, as more costs are now recovered in base rates pursuant to the 2023 Settlement Stipulation. However, revenues related to these increased costs are not collected at the same rate that the expenses are incurred in the interim periods throughout the year due to the impact of volume-based rates and associated revenues. Inflationary pressures on labor-related costs also contributed to the increase in other O M expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023. During the three and nine months ended 2024 compared with the same periods in 2023, these increases in other O M expenses were partially offset by a 2.9 million and 9.1 million deferral of other O M expenses, respectively, related to the conversion from coal to natural gas for two units at the Jim Bridger plant. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income tax expense decreased 10.1 million and 10.4 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased ADITC amortization from the regulatory mechanism described in Note 3 Regulatory Matters to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. For information relating to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's computation of income tax expense, see Note 2 - "Income Taxes" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 Idaho Power funds its liquidity needs for capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, debt offerings, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and capital contributions from IDACORP. Idaho Power periodically files for rate adjustments for recovery of operating costs and capital investments to provide the opportunity to align Idaho Power's earned returns with those allowed by regulators.

Table of Contents 

 As of October 25, 2024, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's access to debt, equity, and credit arrangements included: 
 
 their respective 100 million and 400 million revolving credit facilities; 
 IDACORP's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 16, 2022, which may be used for the issuance of debt securities and common stock, including an aggregate gross sales price of up to 300 million of shares of IDACORP common stock available for issuance through its at-the-market offering program; 
 Idaho Power's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 16, 2022, which may be used for the issuance of first mortgage bonds and other debt securities; 900 million remains available for issuance pursuant to state regulatory authority; 
 IDACORP's and Idaho Power's issuance of commercial paper, with program sizes of 100 million and 300 million, respectively. Idaho Power's commercial paper program may be used up to the 400 million capacity of its credit facility; and 
 IDACORP's FSAs, the remainder of which may be physically settled with common stock in exchange for net proceeds, which as of October 25, 2024, would have been approximately 62 million. 
 
 In January 2024, IDACORP began using original issuances of shares for the IDACORP, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and also intends to use original issuances for share purchases within the Idaho Power Company Employee Savings Plan beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024 or first quarter of 2025. IDACORP may discontinue using original issuances of shares for these plans at any time. 
 
 In May 2024, IDACORP received 230 million in proceeds from the partial settlement of the FSAs and contributed 200 million in capital to Idaho Power. 
 
 In August 2024, Idaho Power issued 300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.20 first mortgage bonds, secured medium-term notes, Series M, maturing in August 2034. 
 
 The proceeds from these common stock and first mortgage bond issuances are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including funding Idaho Power's capital projects. 
 
 IDACORP and Idaho Power monitor capital markets with a view toward favorable debt and equity transactions, taking into account current and potential future long-term needs. As a result, IDACORP may issue debt securities or common stock, and Idaho Power may issue first mortgage bonds or other debt securities, if the companies believe terms available in the capital markets are favorable and that issuances would be financially prudent. IDACORP may also elect to issue common stock, from time to time, under its at-the-market offering program, depending on market conditions and capital needs. Idaho Power also periodically analyzes whether partial or full early redemption of one or more existing outstanding series of first mortgage bonds is desirable, and in some cases, may refinance indebtedness with new indebtedness. 
 
 Based on planned capital expenditures and other O M expenses, the companies believe they will be able to meet capital and debt service requirements and fund corporate expenses during at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future with a combination of existing cash, operating cash flows generated by Idaho Power's utility business, availability under existing credit facilities, access to commercial paper, short-term and long-term debt markets, and equity issuances. 
 
 IDACORP and Idaho Power generally seek to maintain capital structures of approximately 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity. Maintaining this ratio influences IDACORP's and Idaho Power's debt and equity issuance decisions. As of September 30, 2024, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's capital structures, as calculated for purposes of applicable debt covenants, were as follows: 
 IDACORP Idaho Power Debt 49 50 Equity 51 50 
 
 IDACORP and Idaho Power generally maintain their cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, money market funds, and bank deposits. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, IDACORP and Idaho Power believed they were in compliance with all credit facility and long-term debt covenants. Further, IDACORP and Idaho Power do not anticipate they will be in violation or breach of their respective debt covenants during 2024.

 Operating Cash Flows 
 
 IDACORP's and Idaho Power's principal sources of cash flows from operations are Idaho Power's sales of electricity and transmission capacity. Significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of fuel and power, other operating expenses, interest, income taxes, and plan contributions. Operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather conditions, rates and the outcome of regulatory proceedings, and economic conditions. As fuel and purchased power are significant uses of cash, Idaho Power has regulatory mechanisms in place that provide for the deferral and recovery of the majority of the fluctuation in those costs. However, if actual costs rise above the level currently allowed in retail rates, deferral balances increase (reflected as a regulatory asset), negatively affecting operating cash flows until such time as those costs, with interest, are recovered from customers. 
 
 IDACORP s and Idaho Power s operating cash inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 458 million and 470 million, respectively, an increase in cash flows from operations of 296 million for IDACORP and 332 million for Idaho Power, when compared with the same period in 2023. With the exception of cash flows related to income taxes, IDACORP's operating cash flows are principally derived from the operating cash flows from Idaho Power. Significant items that affected the companies' operating cash flows in the first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same period in 2023 were as follows: 
 
 a 21 million and 20 million increase in IDACORP and Idaho Power net income, respectively; 
 changes in regulatory assets and liabilities, mostly related to the relative amounts of costs deferred and collected under the PCA and FCA mechanisms, increased IDACORP and Idaho Power operating cash flows by 123 million; 
 changes in deferred taxes and taxes accrued and receivable combined to decrease operating cash flows for IDACORP and Idaho Power by 20 million and 60 million, respectively; 
 changes in pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and expenses combined to increase IDACORP and Idaho Power operating cash flows by 44 million, which was primarily due to the timing and amount of funding decisions and an increase in the amount of pension-related expenses approved for recovery in base rates pursuant to the 2023 Settlement Stipulation; and 
 changes in working capital balances due primarily to timing, including fluctuations as follows: 
 timing of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues increased operating cash flows by 11 million for IDACORP and 12 million for Idaho Power, 
 the changes in materials, supplies, and fuel stock decreased operating cash flows by 14 million for IDACORP and Idaho Power, which was primarily due to an increase in material and supply inventory and the timing of purchases and consumption of coal at Idaho Power's jointly-owned coal-fired generating plants; 
 the changes in accounts and wages payable increased operating cash flows by 83 million for IDACORP and 161 million for Idaho Power, which was primarily due to a decrease in power supply costs and associated timing of payments, and includes a 78 million difference between IDACORP and Idaho Power related to intercompany estimated tax payments; and 
 the changes in other assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by 30 million for IDACORP and Idaho Power, which was primarily related to a power purchase agreement security deposit and performance assurance collateral activity for margin agreements relating to wholesale commodity contracts. 
 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 
 Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures related to new construction of, and improvements to, Idaho Power s power supply, transmission, and distribution facilities. IDACORP s and Idaho Power s net investing cash outflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased to 756 million and 753 million, respectively, decreasing cash 345 million for IDACORP and 350 million for Idaho Power, when compared with the same period in 2023. Investing cash outflows for 2024 and 2023 were primarily for construction of utility infrastructure needed to address Idaho Power s customer growth and peak resource needs, aging plant and equipment, and environmental and regulatory compliance requirements. This was partially offset in 2024 and 2023 by reimbursements from a B2H project joint permitting participant relating to a portion of the permitting expenditures. 
 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 
 Financing activities primarily provide supplemental cash for both day-to-day operations and capital requirements, as needed. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's net financing cash inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 399 million and 368 million, respectively, a decrease of 119 million for IDACORP and 193 million for Idaho Power, when compared with the same period in 2023. IDACORP and Idaho Power financing cash inflows for 2024 were primarily related to Idaho Power's net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, IDACORP's issuance of common stock, and Idaho Power's receipt of a capital contribution from IDACORP, each as described above in this "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section, offset by 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 dividend payments. IDACORP and Idaho Power financing cash inflows for 2023 were primarily related to Idaho Power's net proceeds from issuances and repayment of long-term debt, offset by dividend payments. Idaho Power funds liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital, managing commodity price risk, dividends, and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations, debt offerings, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and capital contributions from IDACORP. IDACORP funds its cash requirements, such as payment of taxes, payment of dividends, capital contributions to Idaho Power, and non-utility expenses allocated to IDACORP, through cash flows from operations, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and sales of common stock.

 Impact of Credit Ratings on Liquidity and Collateral Obligations 
 
 IDACORP s and Idaho Power s access to capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, depend in part on their respective credit ratings. There have been no changes to IDACORP's or Idaho Power's ratings by Standard Poor s Ratings Services or Moody s from those included in the 2023 Annual Report. However, any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. In April 2024, Moody's rating outlook for IDACORP and Idaho Power was modified to negative, from stable. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power's and IDACORP's issuer credit ratings at Moody's were Baa1 and Baa2, respectively. Moody's credit ratings of Baa3 and above are considered to be investment grade, or prime, ratings by Moody's. These security ratings reflect the views of Moody's. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from Moody's. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. 
 
 Idaho Power maintains margin agreements relating to its wholesale commodity contracts that allow performance assurance collateral to be requested of and/or posted with certain counterparties, which are discussed further in Part I - Item 3 "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" included in this report.

Capital Requirements 
 
 Idaho Power's cash capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC, were 803 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The table below presents Idaho Power's estimated accrual-basis additions to property, plant, and equipment for 2024 (including amounts incurred to-date) through 2028 (in millions of dollars). The amounts in the table exclude AFUDC but include net costs of removing assets from service that Idaho Power expects would be eligible to be included in rate base in future rate case proceedings. Given the uncertainty associated with the timing of infrastructure projects and associated expenditures, actual expenditures and their timing could deviate substantially from those set forth in the table. The timing and amount of actual constructed projects and capital expenditures could be affected by Idaho Power s ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs, supply chain disruptions and delays, project timing, permitting, regulatory determinations, inflationary pressures, macroeconomic conditions, or other issues, including those described below. 
 2024 2025 2026-2028 Expected capital expenditures (excluding AFUDC) 925- 975 1,000- 1,100 3,500- 4,000 
 
 Major Infrastructure Projects: Idaho Power is engaged in the development of a number of significant projects and has entered into arrangements with third parties concerning joint infrastructure development. The discussion below provides a summary of developments in certain of those projects since the discussion of these matters included in Part II, Item 7 - MD A - "Capital Requirements" in the 2023 Annual Report. The discussion below should be read in conjunction with that report. 
 
 Resource Additions to Address Projected Energy and Capacity Deficits : Idaho Power's existing and sustained growth in customers, load, and peak demand for electricity, along with transmission constraints, has created the need for Idaho Power to acquire significant generation, transmission, and storage resources to meet energy and capacity needs over the next several years. To help meet peak needs in 2024 through 2027, Idaho Power entered into: 
 
 contracts or plans to purchase, own, and operate 373 MW of battery storage assets with expected useful lives of approximately 20 years; 
 a contract to purchase and own a 300 MW wind facility; 
 a 20-year agreement to purchase the storage capacity from a 150 MW battery storage facility; 
 an energy and capacity market purchase agreement with an energy marketer giving Idaho Power the right to acquire 200 MW on a daily basis during summer months beginning in 2026 for a term of at least five years; 
 a power purchase agreement for 300 MW output of a planned third-party wind facility; and 
 four power purchase agreements for the combined 745 MW output of planned third-party solar facilities. Idaho Power plans to sell the output of three of these solar power purchase agreements totaling 645 MW exclusively to a large industrial customer pursuant to an agreement under Idaho Power s Clean Energy Your Way program. 
 
 The capital requirements table above includes capital expenditures of more than 1.3 billion from 2024 through 2027 for resource additions to address projected energy and capacity deficits in those years. To help address the additional capacity deficits projected for 2027, Idaho Power continues to evaluate its RFP for additional resources. Depending on factors such as RFP results, the timing of project in-service dates, estimated load and resource balances and customer growth, the nature and quantity of resources owned versus acquired under power purchase agreements or similar agreements, and the outcome of regulatory proceedings, actual expenditures and their timing could deviate substantially from Idaho Power's expected expenditures. 
 
 Boardman-to-Hemingway Transmission Line : The B2H line, a planned 300-mile, high-voltage transmission project between a substation near Boardman, Oregon, and the Hemingway substation near Boise, Idaho, is expected to provide transmission service to meet future resource needs. Material procurement and construction subcontract bid events are in progress. As a result of delays in issuing notices to proceed from state and federal agencies and obtaining right-of-way easements among other items, Idaho Power expects construction will begin no sooner than late 2024 and expects the in-service date for the transmission line will be no earlier than 2027. 
 
 As more fully described in the 2023 Annual Report, Idaho Power's ownership interest in the project is approximately 45 percent. Idaho Power has spent approximately 330 million, including Idaho Power's AFUDC, on the B2H project through September 30, 2024. Pursuant to the terms of the joint funding arrangements, Idaho Power has received 183 million in reimbursement as of September 30, 2024, from project co-participants for their share of costs and continues to receive reimbursement as costs are incurred. PacifiCorp is obligated to reimburse Idaho Power for its share of project expenditures 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 incurred by Idaho Power under the terms of the joint funding agreement. Idaho Power and PacifiCorp operate under a construction funding agreement filed with the FERC. 
 
 The permitting phase of the B2H project was subject to federal review and approval by various federal agencies. Federal agency records of decision have been received and all lawsuits challenging the federal rights-of-way have been resolved. However, Idaho Power has not yet received the required notices to proceed from the applicable federal agencies. 
 
 In the separate State of Oregon permitting process, the state's EFSC approved Idaho Power's site certificate in September 2022. The Oregon Department of Energy subsequently issued a final order and site certificate. Idaho Power is pursuing two amendments to the site certificate to accommodate route changes, many of which are for the benefit of landowners along the route, and to enhance constructability. In September 2023, EFSC approved Idaho Power's first amendment request. One party contested the EFSC's approval of the first amendment in Union County Circuit Court. On October 28, 2024, the Union County Circuit Court issued an order to dismiss the proceeding. Separately, in August 2024, EFSC approved Idaho Power's second amendment request. The approval of the second amendment is being contested. Finally, during the second quarter of 2023, the IPUC, OPUC, and WPSC granted Idaho Power and PacifiCorp their respective CPCNs related to the construction of the B2H project. 
 
 Total cost estimates for the project are between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion, including Idaho Power's AFUDC. The capital requirements table above includes approximately 570 million of Idaho Power's share of estimated costs (excluding AFUDC) related to the remaining permitting phase, design, material procurement, and construction phases of the project. Actual construction costs could differ from Idaho Power's estimates based upon Idaho Power's or its contractors' ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs, supply chain disruptions and delays, inflationary pressures, macroeconomic conditions, or other issues. 
 
 Gateway West Transmission Line : Idaho Power and PacifiCorp are pursuing the joint development of the GWW project, a high-voltage transmission line project between a substation located near Douglas, Wyoming, and the Hemingway substation located near Boise, Idaho. In 2012, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp entered into a joint funding agreement for permitting of the project. Permitting and pre-construction activities are underway for segment 8, the section of line between Hemingway and Midpoint substations. Idaho Power expects the in-service date for segment 8, or a portion of segment 8, will be 2028 or later. 
 
 Idaho Power has expended approximately 65 million, including Idaho Power's AFUDC, for its share of the permitting phase of the project through September 30, 2024. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates the total cost for its share of the project (including both permitting and construction) to be between 900 million and 1.1 billion, including Idaho Power's AFUDC. The estimated cost range is based on assumptions about Idaho Power participation levels in the construction of certain project segments, and any changes in those assumptions or in Idaho Power's actual participation could affect future estimates and actual project costs. The capital requirements table above includes approximately 300 million of Idaho Power's share of estimated costs (excluding AFUDC) for the permitting phase of the project and early construction costs, based on Idaho Power's current estimate that it may commence construction of some applicable segments during that time period. Actual construction costs could differ from Idaho Power's estimates based upon the ability of Idaho Power, PacifiCorp, or their respective contractors to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs, supply chain disruptions and delays, inflationary pressures, macroeconomic conditions, or other issues. 
 
 The permitting phase of the GWW project was subject to review and approval of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The BLM has published its records of decision for all segments of the transmission line. In late 2020, PacifiCorp completed construction and commissioned a 140-mile segment of its portion of the project in Wyoming. Idaho Power and PacifiCorp continue to coordinate the timing of next steps to best meet customer and system needs including potentially modifying the ownership structure of a few segments of the project. 
 
 Defined Benefit Pension Plan Contributions 
 
 Idaho Power has no minimum contribution requirement to its defined benefit pension plan in 2024, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Idaho Power contributed 20 million in a continued effort to balance the regulatory collection of these expenditures with the amount and timing of contributions, as well as to mitigate the cost of being in an underfunded position. The primary impact of pension contributions is on the timing of cash flows, as the timing of cost recovery lags behind contributions.

 Contractual Obligations 
 
 IDACORP s and Idaho Power s contractual cash obligations have not materially changed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, except as disclosed in Note 5 Long-Term Debt and Note 8 Commitments to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 The amount and timing of dividends paid on IDACORP s common stock are within the discretion of IDACORP s board of directors. IDACORP's board of directors reviews the dividend rate periodically to determine its appropriateness in light of IDACORP s current and long-term financial position and results of operations, capital requirements, rating agency considerations, contractual and regulatory restrictions, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the electric utility industry in general and Idaho Power in particular, competitive conditions, and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant. The ability of IDACORP to pay dividends on its common stock is generally dependent upon dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power. 
 
 For additional information relating to IDACORP and Idaho Power dividends, including restrictions on IDACORP s and Idaho Power s payment of dividends, see Note 6 - Common Stock to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 IDACORP's and Idaho Power's off-balance sheet arrangements have not changed materially from those reported in the MD A in the 2023 Annual Report. 

REGULATORY MATTERS 
 
 Introduction 
 
 Idaho Power is under the jurisdiction (as to rates, service, accounting, and other general matters of utility operation) of the IPUC, the OPUC, and the FERC. The IPUC and OPUC determine the rates that Idaho Power is authorized to charge to its retail customers. Idaho Power is also under the regulatory jurisdiction of the IPUC, the OPUC, and the WPSC as to the issuance of debt and equity securities. As a public utility under the Federal Power Act, Idaho Power has authority to charge market-based rates for wholesale energy sales under its FERC tariff and to provide transmission services under its OATT. Additionally, the FERC has jurisdiction over Idaho Power's sales of transmission capacity and wholesale electricity, hydropower project relicensing, and system reliability, among other items. 
 
 Idaho Power develops its regulatory filings taking into consideration short-term and long-term needs for rate relief and several other factors that can affect the structure and timing of those filings. These factors include in-service dates of major capital investments, the timing and magnitude of changes in major revenue and expense items, and customer growth rates, as well as other factors. 
 
 Idaho Power's most recently concluded general rate case in Idaho was filed during 2023. The IPUC approved the 2023 Settlement Stipulation in December 2023 for rates that went into effect for Idaho-jurisdiction customers on January 1, 2024. In May 2024, Idaho Power filed a limited-issue rate case in Idaho. Refer to Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to the Idaho limited-issue rate case. 
 
 In September 2024, the OPUC approved the 2024 Oregon Settlement Stipulations in connection with Idaho Power's Oregon general rate case. The 2024 Oregon Settlement Stipulations provide for revised tariff schedules designed to increase annual Oregon-jurisdictional retail revenue by 6.7 million, or 12.14 percent, effective October 15, 2024. The 2024 Oregon Settlement Stipulations also provide for a 9.5 percent Oregon-jurisdiction return on year-end equity and a 7.302 percent Oregon-jurisdiction authorized rate of return based on a 5.104 percent cost of debt and capital structure of 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity, applied to an Oregon-jurisdictional rate base of 188.9 million. For more information on the Oregon general rate case and related 2024 Oregon Settlement Stipulations, see Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 Between general rate cases, Idaho Power relies upon customer growth, an FCA mechanism, power cost adjustment mechanisms, tariff riders, limited-issue rate proceedings, and other mechanisms to mitigate the impact of regulatory lag, which 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 refers to the period of time between making an investment or incurring an expense and recovering that investment or expense and earning a return. 
 
 The outcomes of significant proceedings are described in part in this report and further in the 2023 Annual Report. In addition to the discussion below, which includes notable regulatory developments since the discussion of these matters in the 2023 Annual Report, refer to Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to Idaho Power's regulatory matters and recent regulatory filings and orders. 
 
 Notable Retail Rate or Revenue Changes 
 
 During 2024, Idaho Power received orders authorizing the rate or revenue changes summarized in the table below. 
 Description Status Estimated Impact (1) 
 Notes PCA - Idaho New PCA rate became effective June 1, 2024 35.7 million PCA decrease for the period from June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025 The income statement impact of revenue changes associated with the PCA mechanism is largely offset by associated increases and decreases in actual power supply costs and amortization of deferred power supply costs. The rate decrease primarily reflects forecasted improved hydropower generation. FCA - Idaho New FCA rate became effective June 1, 2024 11.7 million FCA increase for the period from June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025 The FCA is designed to remove a portion of Idaho Power s financial disincentive to invest in energy efficiency programs by partially separating (or decoupling) the recovery of fixed costs from the volumetric kilowatt-hour charge and instead linking it to a set amount per customer. APCU - Oregon New APCU rate became effective June 1, 2024 6.9 million APCU decrease for the period from June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025 The rate decrease reflects increased hydropower generation and decreased forward market electric prices. 
 (1) The annual amount collected in rates is typically not recovered on a straight-line basis (i.e., 1/12th per month), and is instead recovered in proportion to retail sales volumes. 
 
 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing from Idaho Settlement Stipulation 
 
 A May 2018 Idaho settlement stipulation related to tax reform (2018 Settlement Stipulation) and the 2023 Settlement Stipulation are each described in Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters" to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report. The 2023 Settlement Stipulation modified the 2018 Settlement Stipulation in part. IDACORP and Idaho Power believe that the terms allowing additional amortization of ADITC in the settlement stipulations provide the companies with a greater degree of earnings stability than would be possible without the terms of the stipulations in effect. Based on its estimate of full-year 2024 Idaho ROE, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, Idaho Power recorded 2.5 million and 22.5 million, respectively, in additional ADITC amortization under the settlement stipulations. Accordingly, at September 30, 2024, approximately 87.5 million of additional ADITC remains available for future use. 
 
 Change in Deferred (Accrued) Net Power Supply Costs and the Power Cost Adjustment Mechanisms 
 
 Deferred (accrued) power supply costs represent certain differences between Idaho Power's actual net power supply costs and the costs included in its retail rates, the latter being based on annual forecasts of power supply costs. Deferred (accrued) power supply costs are recorded on the balance sheets for future recovery or refund through customer rates. 
 
 Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions address the volatility of power supply costs and provide for annual adjustments to the rates charged to retail customers. The power cost adjustment mechanisms and associated financial impacts are described further in "Results of Operations" in this MD A and in Note 3 - "Regulatory Matters" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 With the exception of power supply expenses incurred under PURPA and certain demand response program costs that are passed through to customers substantially in full, the PCA mechanism allows Idaho Power to pass through to customers 95 percent of the differences in actual net power supply expenses as compared with base net power supply expenses, whether positive or negative. Thus, the primary financial statement impact of power supply cost deferrals or accruals is that the timing 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 of when cash is paid out for power supply expenses differs from when those costs are recovered from customers, impacting operating cash flows from year to year. 
 
 The following table summarizes the change in deferred (accrued) net power supply costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions). 
 Idaho Oregon Total Balance at December 31, 2023 115.6 (1.3) 114.3 Current period net power supply costs accrued (26.8) (2.4) (29.2) Prior amounts collected through rates (72.9) (0.2) (73.1) Renewable energy certificate sales (10.4) (0.4) (10.8) Interest and other 2.8 (0.1) 2.7 Balance at September 30, 2024 
 8.3 (4.4) 3.9 
 
 Open Access Transmission Tariff Posting 
 
 Idaho Power uses a formula rate for transmission service provided under its OATT, which provides that transmission rates will be updated annually based primarily on financial and operational data Idaho Power files with the FERC. In August 2024, Idaho Power filed its 2024 final transmission rate with the FERC, reflecting a transmission rate of 31.55 per kilowatt-year (kW-year), to be effective for the period from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025. Idaho Power's final rate was based on a net annual transmission revenue requirement of 137.9 million. The OATT rate in effect from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024, was 30.74 per kW-year based on a net annual transmission revenue requirement of 135.7 million. A kW-year is a unit of electrical capacity equivalent to 1 kilowatt of power used for 8,760 hours. 
 
 Integrated Resource Plan and Resource Procurement Filings 
 
 Idaho Power filed its most recent IRP with the IPUC and OPUC in September 2023, as described in the 2023 Annual Report. The IPUC and the OPUC acknowledged Idaho Power's 2023 IRP in June 2024 and August 2024, respectively. 
 
 In March and April 2024, Idaho Power filed applications with the IPUC for two of the bids from its RFP to procure resources for its anticipated energy and capacity needs in 2026 and 2027. In the March 2024 application, Idaho Power requested that the IPUC approve a market purchase agreement with an energy marketer to purchase 200 MW of firm capacity for specified periods of time. The IPUC approved this application in August 2024. In the April 2024 application, Idaho Power applied for a CPCN to acquire and own 150 MW of battery storage with an expected useful life of 20 years. As of the date of this report, the IPUC's decision is pending. 
 
 In August 2024, following review by an independent evaluator appointed by the OPUC, OPUC staff, and other intervenors, the OPUC issued an order approving Idaho Power's final RFP to procure resources for its anticipated energy and capacity needs in 2028 and beyond. 
 
 Jim Bridger Power Plant Non-Fuel O M Expenses 
 
 In September 2024, the IPUC issued an order authorizing Idaho Power to include all non-fuel O M expenses associated with operations of the Jim Bridger plant in the balancing account previously established to track the incremental costs, benefits, and required regulatory accounting associated with ceasing participation in coal-fired operations at the Jim Bridger plant, which resulted in a 12.2 million deferral of costs to a regulatory asset account for future recovery. 
 
 Large Customer Rate Proceedings 
 
 Brisbie, LLC (Brisbie) Data Center : In May 2023, the IPUC approved a special contract (Brisbie Special Contract) between Idaho Power and a large load customer, Brisbie, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Meta Platforms, Inc., for service to a new 960,000 square-foot enterprise data center. The Brisbie Special Contract allows Idaho Power to procure enough renewable resources to provide Brisbie with 100 percent renewable energy on an annual basis for Brisbie's facility. In April 2023, Idaho Power received IPUC approval of a contract with a 200 MW solar project that is scheduled to begin operating as early as March 2025. Idaho Power will assign the cost and renewable attributes of the energy from the solar facility to Brisbie in accordance with the Brisbie Special Contract. In May 2024, Idaho Power received IPUC approval of an additional contract with a 125 MW solar project to be online in December 2026 for energy to be purchased by Brisbie. 
 56 

Table of Contents 

In May 2024, Idaho Power also filed an application with the IPUC for approval of the second amendment to the Brisbie Special Contract that provides for changes in certain pricing elements under the Brisbie Special Contract to reflect the most currently available data. As of the date of this report, the IPUC's decision is pending. 
 
 Micron Special Contract : In May 2024, Idaho Power filed an application for approval of the third amendment to the Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) Special Contract, which provides for changes in certain pricing elements under the special contract to reflect the most currently available data. As of the date of this report, the IPUC's decision is pending. 
 
 Relicensing of Hydropower Projects 
 
 HCC Relicensing: In connection with Idaho Power's major efforts to relicense the HCC, Idaho Power's largest hydropower complex, as described in more detail in the 2023 Annual Report in Part II, Item 7 - MD A "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Regulatory Matters," in July 2020, Idaho Power submitted to the FERC its supplement to the final license application, incorporating the settlement agreement reached between Idaho and Oregon on the CWA Section 401 certifications. The supplement included feedback on proposed modifications of the 2007 final EIS for the HCC, as well as an updated cost analysis of the HCC and a request that the FERC issue a 50-year license and initiate a supplemental NEPA process at the FERC. In June 2022, the FERC issued a notice of intent to prepare a supplemental EIS in accordance with NEPA. The FERC also reinstated informal consultation with the USFWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service under section 7 of the ESA. In May 2024, the FERC issued an updated schedule for the supplemental EIS, indicating that the draft and final supplemental EIS would be issued no later than July 2024 and February 2025, respectively. As of the date of this report, the FERC has not issued the draft supplemental EIS. 
 
 Relicensing costs of 487 million (including AFUDC) for the HCC were included in construction work in progress at September 30, 2024. As of the date of this report, the IPUC authorizes Idaho Power to include in its Idaho jurisdiction rates approximately 8.8 million of AFUDC annually relating to the HCC relicensing project. Collecting these amounts currently will reduce future collections when HCC relicensing costs are approved for recovery in base rates. As of September 30, 2024, Idaho Power's regulatory liability for collection of AFUDC relating to the HCC was 246 million. 
 
 As of the date of this report, Idaho Power believes issuance of a new HCC license by the FERC will be in 2026 or thereafter. Idaho Power is unable to predict the exact timing that the FERC will issue a new license or the ultimate capital investment and ongoing operating and maintenance costs Idaho Power will incur in complying with a new license. Idaho Power estimates that the annual costs it will incur to obtain a new long-term license for the HCC, including AFUDC but excluding costs expected to be incurred for complying with the license after issuance, are likely to range from 35 million to 45 million until issuance of the license. Upon issuance of a long-term license, Idaho Power expects that the annual capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses associated with compliance with the terms and conditions of the long-term license could also be substantial. In December 2016, Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC requesting a determination that Idaho Power's expenditures of 220.8 million through year-end 2015 on relicensing of the HCC were prudently incurred, and thus eligible for future inclusion in retail rates in a future rate proceeding. In April 2018, the IPUC issued an order approving a settlement stipulation signed by Idaho Power, the IPUC staff, and a third-party intervenor recognizing that a total of 216.5 million in expenditures were reasonably incurred, and therefore should be eligible for inclusion in customer rates at a later date. 
 
 American Falls Relicensing: In 2020, Idaho Power filed with the FERC a notice of intent to file an application to relicense the American Falls hydropower facility, which is Idaho Power's largest hydropower facility outside of the HCC, with a nameplate generating capacity of 92.3 MW. Idaho Power owns the generation facility but not the structural dam or reservoir, which are owned by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Idaho Power filed the final relicensing application with the FERC in February 2023. In September 2023, Idaho Power filed an application for CWA Section 401 water quality certification with the IDEQ. In September 2024, IDEQ issued a final CWA Section 401 water quality certification. In October 2024, FERC issued a revised notice of intent to prepare an environmental assessment, signaling that FERC staff does not anticipate that licensing the project will constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect the quality of the human environment. FERC s revised schedule targets release of the environmental assessment in January 2025 with comments due in February 2025. 
 
 Idaho Power's current license at American Falls expires in February 2025. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power anticipates the FERC will issue a new license for this facility in 2025. If the current license expires before the new license is issued, Idaho Power expects to continue to operate its American Falls facility on annual licenses issued by the FERC with the same conditions as the current license.

 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 
 Overview 
 
 Idaho Power is subject to a broad range of federal, state, regional, and local laws and regulations designed to protect, restore, and enhance the environment, including the CAA, the CWA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and the ESA, among other laws. These laws are administered by a number of federal, state, and local agencies. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and associated costs, these laws and regulations provide authority to regulators to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, injunctive relief, and other sanctions. Idaho Power's co-owned coal-fired power plant, its co-owned coal- and gas-fired power plant, and its three wholly-owned natural gas-fired combustion turbine power plants are subject to many of these regulations. Idaho Power's hydropower projects are also subject to a number of water discharge standards and other environmental requirements. 
 
 Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may: 
 
 increase the operating costs of generating plants; 
 increase the construction costs and lead time for new facilities; 
 require the modification of existing generating plants, which could result in additional costs; 
 require the curtailment, fuel-switching, or shut-down of existing generating plants; 
 reduce the output from current generating facilities; or 
 require the acquisition of alternative sources of energy or storage technology, increased transmission wheeling, or construction of additional generating facilities, which could result in higher costs. 
 
 Current and future environmental laws and regulations could significantly increase the cost of operating fossil fuel-fired generation plants and constructing new generation and transmission facilities, in large part through the substantial cost of permitting activities and the required installation of additional pollution control devices. In many parts of the United States, some higher-cost, high-emission coal-fired plants have ceased operation or the plant owners have announced a near-term cessation of operation or conversion to natural gas, as the cost of compliance makes coal plants uneconomical to operate. The decision to cease operation of the Boardman power plant in 2020 was based in part on the significant cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The decision to end participation in coal-fired operations of one unit at the North Valmy plant was also based in part on the economics of continuing coal-fired generation at the plant. Beyond increasing costs generally, these environmental laws and regulations could affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition if the costs associated with these environmental requirements and early plant retirements cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis. 
 
 Part I - "Business - Utility Operations - Environmental Regulation and Costs" in the 2023 Annual Report includes a summary of Idaho Power's expected capital and operating expenditures for environmental matters during the period from 2024 to 2026. Given the uncertainty of future environmental regulations and technological advances, Idaho Power cannot make near-term estimates with certainty and is also unable to predict its environmental-related expenditures beyond 2026, though they could be substantial. 
 
 A summary of notable environmental matters (including conditions and events associated with climate change) impacting, or expected to potentially impact, IDACORP and Idaho Power is included in Part II, Item 7 - MD A - "Environmental Matters" and MD A - "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Requirements - Environmental Regulation Costs" in the 2023 Annual Report. Recent developments in certain environmental matters relevant to Idaho Power are described below. 
 
 Clean Air Act Matters 
 
 Regional Haze : In April 2024, the EPA proposed to approve revisions to the Wyoming Regional Haze SIP for the first planning period of 2008-2018. The proposed SIP replaces Wyoming s previously approved source-specific nitrogen oxide determination for Idaho Power s jointly owned Jim Bridger plant. Operations at the Jim Bridger plant have previously been modified to comply in advance with the proposed SIP. Accordingly, Idaho Power does not expect the proposed SIP, if approved, to require any additional changes to current operations at the Jim Bridger plant. As of the date of this report, the EPA's approval of the Wyoming SIP for the first planning period is pending. 
 
 In August 2024, the EPA proposed to approve in part and disapprove in part the proposed Wyoming Regional Haze SIP for the second planning period of 2018-2028. The public comment period for the EPA's proposed action ended on September 3, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 Idaho Power submitted comments requesting that the EPA approve in full Wyoming's Regional Haze SIP for the second planning period. As of the date of this report, the EPA has not taken final action on its proposal. 
 
 Good Neighbor Rule : On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion in Ohio v. EPA that granted an application to stay the EPA s Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) promulgated under the Good Neighbor Provision of the CAA. This action put a hold on any related compliance obligations for the North Valmy plant, which is co-owned by Idaho Power and NV Energy and operated by NV Energy. The stay is expected to remain in place until the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, reaches a decision on the applicants' challenge to the FIP. 
 
 New Section 111 Rule : In April 2024, the EPA released a final rule under Section 111 of the CAA (New Section 111 Rule) that regulates carbon dioxide emissions from coal- and natural gas-fired electric generating units. Under the final rule, applicable standards of emission reduction vary based upon the retirement date of coal units and the capacity factor of existing and new natural gas units. The EPA based some of its requirements on carbon capture and storage technology. Idaho Power, among many other parties, filed suit in May 2024 in the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, to challenge the New Section 111 Rule. Idaho Power's suit was consolidated with other similar suits and remains pending. 
 
 Mercury and Air Toxic Standards : In April 2024, the EPA finalized Mercury and Air Toxic Standards in Section 112 of the CAA for coal-fired power plants (MATS Rule). As applicable to Idaho Power, the MATS Rule amends the filterable particulate matter (fPM) surrogate emission standard for non-mercury metal hazardous air pollutants for existing coal-fired power plants and the fPM emission standard compliance demonstration requirements. The Jim Bridger plant expects to install fPM monitoring equipment on its coal-fired units to comply with the MATS Rule. The North Valmy plant does not expect to make changes to current operations as a result of the MATS Rule, due to the planned conversion of its two units from coal to natural gas in 2026. 
 
 Clean Water Act Matters 
 
 CWA Permitting : Idaho Power's hydropower generation facilities are subject to compliance and permitting obligations under the CWA. Idaho Power has been engaged for several years with the EPA, and is now engaged with the IDEQ, regarding Idaho Power's CWA permitting obligations and compliance status for those facilities. Idaho Power has in the past, and expects in the future, to incur costs associated with those permitting and compliance obligations, but as of the date of this report, Idaho Power is unable to estimate with any reasonable certainty those costs. Idaho Power also expects to incur additional costs associated with the relicensing of its hydropower facilities, as discussed elsewhere in this report. 
 
 In June 2022, Idaho Power and the IDEQ entered into a consent judgment in the Idaho state district courts to resolve a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permitting issue related to 15 of Idaho Power s hydropower projects that required Idaho Power to pay a 1.1 million fine, implement interim measures for compliance, and ultimately submit applications for new permits at each of the dams subject to the consent judgment. Due to a misinterpretation of law, the EPA cancelled water discharge permits in the mid-1990 s, which Idaho Power subsequently determined were applicable for operation of the dams. Idaho Power believes that the dams would have been in compliance with the earlier permits had they remained in place. Idaho Power has submitted new permit appl ications for all 15 of the dams. 
 
 Effluent Limitations : In April 2024, EPA finalized effluent limitation guidelines and standards that set new water treatment standards for coal plants. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power does not believe that the new effluent limitation guidelines and standards will have a material impact on its jointly-owned and operated coal-fired facilities. 
 
 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Matters 
 
 Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the EPA finalized changes to the coal combustion residual regulations for inactive surface impoundments at inactive electric utilities. The EPA is establishing groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure and post closure care requirements for these areas. Idaho Power continues to work with the co-owners of its coal-fired generation plants to evaluate the potential impacts of these regulations, which could affect the amount of asset retirement obligations recorded in Idaho Power's consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Invasive Species Management 
 
 Quagga mussels are an invasive species that were first detected in the Snake River system in 2023 in the mid-Snake River near Twin Falls in Idaho Power's service area. Quagga mussel infestations can clog and damage irrigation, hydropower, and water delivery facilities and increase the costs to maintain such facilities. The Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) treated the affected area in 2023 with a copper-based, EPA-approved treatment. ISDA sampling in September 2024 detected the 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 continued presence of quagga mussels. As a result, the ISDA plans additional treatments in 2024 to eradicate quagga mussels in the affected area. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power cannot predict the extent to which the additional treatments will be successful in eradicating quagga mussels from the Snake River or the potential increase in other O M expenses related to quagga mussel mitigation efforts. If a quagga mussel infestation occurs, it may result in increased other O M costs for mitigation efforts and other adverse impacts for Idaho Power's operation of its hydropower facilities in any infested areas. 

OTHER MATTERS 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 IDACORP's and Idaho Power's discussion and analysis of their financial condition and results of operations are based upon their condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires IDACORP and Idaho Power to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, IDACORP and Idaho Power evaluate these estimates, including those estimates related to rate regulation, retirement benefits, contingencies, asset impairment, income taxes, unbilled revenues, and the allowance for uncollectible accounts. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and are the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. IDACORP and Idaho Power, based on their ongoing reviews, make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. 
 
 IDACORP s and Idaho Power s critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committees of the boards of directors. These policies have not changed materially from the discussion of those policies included under "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 For discussion of new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 - "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 IDACORP is exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, changes in commodity prices, credit risk, and equity price risk. The following discussion summarizes material changes in these risks since December 31, 2023, and the financial instruments, derivative instruments, and derivative commodity instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and equity prices that were held at September 30, 2024. IDACORP has not entered into any of these market-risk-sensitive instruments for speculative purposes. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 IDACORP manages interest expense and short- and long-term liquidity through a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Generally, the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance, but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly - rated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination. 
 
 Variable Rate Debt : As of September 30, 2024, IDACORP had no net variable rate debt, as the carrying value of short-term investments exceeded the carrying value of outstanding variable rate debt. 
 
 Fixed Rate Debt : As of September 30, 2024, IDACORP had 3.1 billion in fixed rate debt, with a fair value of approximately 3.0 billion. These instruments are fixed rate and, therefore, do not expose the companies to a loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately 362 million if market interest rates were to decline by one percentage point from their September 30, 2024 levels. 
 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 IDACORP's exposure to changes in commodity prices is related to Idaho Power's ongoing utility operations that produce electricity to meet the demand of its retail electric customers. These changes in commodity prices are mitigated in large part by Idaho Power's Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms. To supplement its supply resources and balance its supply of power with the demand of its retail customers, Idaho Power participates in the wholesale marketplace. IDACORP's commodity price risk as of September 30, 2024, had not changed materially from that reported in Item 7A of the 2023 Annual Report. Information regarding Idaho Power s use of derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk can be found in Note 11 - "Derivative Financial Instruments" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 IDACORP is subject to credit risk based on Idaho Power's activity with market counterparties. Idaho Power is exposed to this risk to the extent that a counterparty may fail to fulfill a contractual obligation to provide energy, purchase energy, or complete financial settlement for market activities. Idaho Power mitigates this exposure by actively establishing credit limits; measuring, monitoring, and reporting credit risk; using appropriate contractual arrangements; and transferring of credit risk through the use of financial guarantees, cash, bonds, or letters of credit. Idaho Power maintains a current list of acceptable counterparties and credit limits. 
 
 The use of performance assurance collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit, bonds, or guarantees is common industry practice. Idaho Power maintains margin agreements relating to its wholesale commodity contracts that allow performance assurance collateral to be requested of and/or posted with certain counterparties. As of September 30, 2024, Idaho Power posted 25 million of cash performance assurance collateral related to these contracts. Should Idaho Power experience a reduction in its credit rating on Idaho Power's unsecured debt to below investment grade, Idaho Power could be subject to requests by its wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral. Counterparties to derivative instruments and other forward contracts could request immediate payment or demand immediate ongoing full daily collateralization on derivative instruments and contracts in net liability positions. Based upon Idaho Power's energy and fuel portfolio and then existing market conditions as of September 30, 2024, the amount of additional collateral that could have been requested upon a downgrade to below investment grade was approximately 14 million. To minimize capital requirements, Idaho Power actively monitors the portfolio exposure and the potential exposure to additional requests for performance assurance collateral calls through sensitivity analysis. 
 
 IDACORP's credit risk related to uncollectible accounts, net of amounts reserved, as of September 30, 2024, had not changed materially from that reported in Item 7A of the 2023 Annual Report, except as disclosed in Note 4 - "Revenues" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. Additional information regarding Idaho Power s management of credit risk and credit contingent features can be found in Note 11 - "Derivative Financial Instruments" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 Equity Price Risk 
 
 IDACORP is exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets, primarily through Idaho Power's defined benefit pension plan assets, a mine reclamation trust fund owned by an equity-method investment of Idaho Power, and other equity security investments at Idaho Power. The equity securities held by the pension plan and in such accounts are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector, or geographic region. Idaho Power has established asset allocation targets for the pension plan holdings, which are described in Note 11 - "Benefit Plans" to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 IDACORP : The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of IDACORP, based on their evaluation of IDACORP s disclosure controls and procedures (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, have concluded that IDACORP s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are effective as of that date.

Exhibit 95.1 
 
 Mine Safety Disclosures Required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
 
 Idaho Power is the parent company of Idaho Energy Resources Co. (IERCo), a joint owner of Bridger Coal Company (BCC), which mines coal at the Bridger Coal Mine and processing facility (Mine) near Rock Springs, Wyoming. IERCo owns a one-third interest in BCC. The Mine is comprised of the Bridger surface operations. Underground operations are no longer conducted. Day-to-day operation and management of coal mining and processing operations at the Mine are conducted through BCC's joint owner. Operation of the Mine is regulated by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Safety Act). MSHA inspects the Mine on a regular basis and may issue citations, notices, orders, or any combination thereof, when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Safety Act. Monetary penalties are assessed by MSHA for citations. The severity and assessment of penalties may be reduced or, in some cases, dismissed through the contest and appeal process. Amounts are reported regardless of whether BCC has challenged or appealed the matter. 
 
 The table below summarizes the number of citations, notices, and orders issued, and penalties assessed, by MSHA for the Mine under the indicated provisions of the Mine Safety Act, and other data for the Mine, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. Legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (FMSHRC) are as of September 30, 2024. Due to timing and other factors, the data may not agree with the mine data retrieval system maintained by MSHA at www.msha.gov. 
 Three-month period ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited) Surface Mine (MSHA ID No. 4800677) Mine Safety Act Citations and Orders Section 104(a) Significant & Substantial Citations (1) 
 Section 104(b) Orders (2) 
 Section 104(d) Citations & Orders (3) 
 Section 107(a) Imminent Danger Orders (4) 
 Total Value of Proposed MSHA Assessments (in thousands) Legal Actions Pending Legal Actions Issued During Period Legal Actions Closed During Period Number of Fatalities _________________ (1) For alleged violations of a mandatory mining safety standard or regulation where such violation contributed to a discrete safety hazard and there exists a reasonable likelihood that the hazard will result in an injury or illness and there is a reasonable likelihood that such injury will be of a reasonably serious nature. 
 (2) For alleged failure to totally abate the subject matter of a Mine Safety Act Section 104(a) citation within the period specified in the citation or as subsequently extended. 
 (3) For an alleged unwarrantable failure (i.e., aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence) to comply with a mining safety standard or regulation. 
 (4) The existence of any condition or practice in a coal or other mine that could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm if normal mining operations were permitted to proceed in the area before such condition or practice is eliminated. 

For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Mine did not receive written notice from MSHA of (i) a flagrant violation under Section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Safety Act (ii) a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such a nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other mine health or safety hazards under Section 104(e) of the Mine Safety Act or (iii) the potential to have such a pattern.
