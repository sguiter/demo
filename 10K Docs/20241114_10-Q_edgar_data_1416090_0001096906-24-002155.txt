Historically operated two mining projects and currently operate as a consultant and advisor to the mining industry. Additionally, we have been engaged in the production of precious metals. From 2013 to 2020, the Company owned certain real property and the associated exploration permits and mineral rights commonly known as the UP and Burlington Gold Mine in Idaho UP and Burlington ). From 2015 through January 24, 2023, the Company operated the Clavo Rico mine in Honduras through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Compa a Minera Cerros del Sur, S.A de C.V. CMCS and other mining concessions. The Clavo Rico mine s workings include several historical underground mining operations dating back to the early Mayan and Spanish occupation, and the primary mine operated through 2022 is located on the 200-hectare Clavo Rico Concession, located in southern Honduras. 2023 Divestiture of the Clavo Rico Mine On January 12, 2023, Inception Mining, Inc. (the Company entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (the LOI with Mother Lode Mining, Inc. MLM ). The LOI became binding on January 24, 2023 when the final installment of initial payment set forth under the LOI was received by the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Company agreed to sell all of the shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Compa a Minera Cerros Del Sur, S.A. de C.V. CMCS ), to MLM. CMCS is the Honduran-based company that owns the Clavo Rico mine. 18 Table of Contents The purchase price for the sale of CMCS by the Company to MLM consisted of the following cash consideration (a) 280,000 was delivered by MLM to the Company on January 3, 2023 to pay outstanding debts owed by the Corporation; (b) 300,000 was delivered by MLM to the Company on January 5, 2023 to satisfy existing debts of the Company; (c) 100,000 was delivered by MLM to the Company on January 16, 2023; (d) 200,000 was delivered by MLM to the Company on January 17, 2023; (e) 1,200,000 was delivered by MLM to the Company on January 18, 2023, to pay a settlement amount for existing debt of the Company; (f) 500,000 was delivered by MLM to the Company on January 23, 2023, to satisfy existing debts of the Company; (g) 500,000 was delivered by MLM to the Corporation on January 24, 2023 to satisfy existing debts of the Corporation. In addition to the amounts already delivered under the LOI, an additional amount of 2,620,0000 shall be paid by MLM to the Company over a period of twenty-four (24) months (the Monthly Payments ). The Monthly Payments shall be paid as follows: (i) 25,000 due March 1, 2023, (ii) 50,000 due on the first day of each of April, May and June 2023, and (iii) 100,000 due on the first day of each month for the following twenty months, until February 1, 2025 at which point all amounts due and payable hereunder shall be delivered in a final balloon payment. Outstanding balances and missed Monthly Payments will be secured by a 10 NSR on the Clavo Rico mine production until the Monthly Payments are delivered and the purchase price is paid in full. In addition to the Monthly Payments, the Company will receive a carried forward net profits interest royalty NPI of 5 on the Clavo Rico mine production until the total NPI paid to the Company is 1,000,000, subject to limited conditions. Following the Closing of the LOI on January 24, 2023, the Company divested its ownership interest in CMCS and its interests in the Clavo Rico mine, resulting in the transfer of operations to Mother Lode Mining and full control of the Clavo Rico mine asset. Current Operations Since the Divestiture of the Clavo Rico Mine, the Company has been operating as a consultant and advisor to the mining industry. It also has an ongoing financial interest in the Clavo Rico Mine under the LOI. According to the LOI, the Company is entitled to receive 2,700,000 in cash payments through January 2025, with such payments secured by a ten percent net smelter royalty on the Clavo Rico Mine s production. The Company has fully allowed against this receivable due to the uncertainty of collecting. The Company will also receive a carried forward net profits interest royalty of five percent of the Clavo Rico mine production until payment to the Company reaches 1,000,000, subject to reduction for certain limited Clavo Rico mine expenses. Results of Operations Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 We had net loss of 279,946 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and a net loss of 534,059 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, reflects assets of 3,244. We had cash in the amount of 0 and working capital deficit in the amount of 3,439,237 as of September 30, 2024. Thus, we do not have sufficient working capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months. Working Capital September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Current assets - 10,002 Current liabilities 3,439,237 1,576,349 Working capital deficit (3,439,237 (1,566,347 We anticipate generating losses and, therefore, may be unable to continue operations in the future, if we don t acquire additional capital and issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party. Going Concern Consideration As reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company and has an accumulated deficit of 29,953,037. In addition, there is a working capital deficit of 3,439,237 as of September 30, 2024. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 20 Table of Contents Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities (64,288 1,258,974 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities - (652 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 64,286 (1,218,802 Effects of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash - 1,105 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash (2 40,625 Operating Activities Net cash flow used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 64,288, a decrease of 1,323,262 from the 1,258,974 net cash provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States.

We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financials.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
