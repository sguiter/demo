 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act) provides a "safe harbor" to encourage companies to provide prospective information, as long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements. Certain information contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q (including certain statements in the consolidated financial statements and related notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis), or in any other written or oral statements made by us in communications with the financial community or contained in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. Forward-looking statements are those not based on historical information, but rather relate to our outlook, future operations, strategies, financial results, or other developments. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to update these statements, even if made available on our website or otherwise. These statements may be made directly in this document or may be made part of this document by reference to other documents filed by us with the SEC, a practice which is known as "incorporation by reference." You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as "will," "may," "should," "could," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "plans," "assumes," "intends," "projects," "goals, "objectives," or similar expressions in this document or in documents incorporated herein.

 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements - Continued 
 
 These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. We caution readers that the following factors, in addition to other factors mentioned from time to time, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements: 
 
 Fluctuation in insurance reserve liabilities and claim payments due to changes in claim incidence, recovery rates, mortality and morbidity rates, and policy benefit offsets due to, among other factors, the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence, the emergence of new diseases, epidemics, or pandemics, new trends and developments in medical treatments, the effectiveness of our claims operational processes, and changes in governmental programs. 
 Sustained periods of low interest rates. 
 Unfavorable economic or business conditions, both domestic and foreign, that may result in decreases in sales, premiums, or persistency, as well as unfavorable claims activity or unfavorable returns on our investment portfolio. 
 The impact of pandemics and other public health issues on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and overall business operations. 
 Changes in, or interpretations or enforcement of, laws and regulations. 
 A cybersecurity attack or other security breach resulting in compromised data or the unauthorized acquisition of confidential data. 
 The failure of our business recovery and incident management processes to resume our business operations in the event of a natural catastrophe, cybersecurity attack, or other event. 
 Investment results, including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, defaults, changes in credit spreads, impairments, and the lack of appropriate investments in the market which can be acquired to match our liabilities. 
 Increased competition from other insurers and financial services companies due to industry consolidation, new entrants to our markets, or other factors. 
 Ineffectiveness of our derivatives hedging programs due to changes in forecasted cash flows, the economic environment, counterparty risk, ratings downgrades, capital market volatility, changes in interest rates, and/or regulation. 
 Changes in our financial strength and credit ratings. 
 Actual experience in the broad array of our products that deviates from our assumptions used in pricing, underwriting, and reserving. 
 Our ability to hire and retain qualified employees. 
 Our ability to develop digital capabilities or execute on our technology systems upgrades or replacements. 
 Availability of reinsurance in the market and the ability of our reinsurers to meet their obligations to us. 
 Ability to generate sufficient internal liquidity and/or obtain external financing. 
 Damage to our reputation due to, among other factors, regulatory investigations, legal proceedings, external events, and/or inadequate or failed internal controls and procedures. 
 Disruptions to our business or our ability to leverage data caused by the use and reliance on third party vendors, including vendors providing web and cloud based applications. 
 Recoverability and/or realization of the carrying value of our intangible assets, long-lived assets, and deferred tax assets. 
 Effectiveness of our risk management program. 
 Contingencies and the level and results of litigation. 
 Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Our ability to meet environment, social, and governance standards and expectations of investors, regulators, customers, and other stakeholders. 
 
 For further discussion of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see Part 1, Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued using active trades from TRACE pricing or broker market maker prices for which there was current market activity in that specific security (comparable to receiving one binding quote). The prices obtained were not adjusted, and the assets were classified as Level 1. 
 
 The remaining percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on non-binding quotes or other observable and unobservable inputs, as discussed below: 
 
 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices from pricing services that generally use observable inputs such as prices for securities or comparable securities in active markets in their valuation techniques. These assets were classified as Level 2. 
 
 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on one or more non-binding broker quotes, if validated by observable market data. When only one price is available, it is used if observable inputs and analysis confirms that it is appropriate. These assets, for which we were able to validate the price using other observable market data, were classified as Level 2. 
 
 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices of comparable securities, internal models, or pricing services or other non-binding quotes with no other observable market data. These assets were classified as either Level 2 or Level 3, with the categorization dependent on whether there was other observable market data. 
 
 Derivatives 
 
 Fair values for derivatives other than embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance arrangements are based on market quotes or pricing models and represent the net amount of cash we would have paid or received if the contracts had been settled or closed as of the last day of the period. Credit risk related to the counterparty and the Company is considered in determining the fair values of these derivatives. However, since we have collateralization agreements in place with each counterparty which limits our exposure, any credit risk is immaterial. Therefore, we determined that no adjustments for credit risk were required as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 Fair values for our embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement are estimated using internal pricing models and represent the hypothetical value of the duration mismatch of assets and liabilities, interest rate risk, and third party credit risk embedded in the modified coinsurance arrangement. 
 
 We consider transactions in inactive markets to be less representative of fair value. We use all available observable inputs when measuring fair value, but when significant unobservable inputs are used, we classify these assets or liabilities as Level 3. 
 
 Private Equity Partnerships 
 
 Our private equity partnerships represent funds that are primarily invested in private credit, private equity, and real assets, as described below. Distributions received from the funds arise from income generated by the underlying investments as well as the liquidation of the underlying investments. There is generally not a public market for these investments.

 Other than market convention, the impact of isolated decreases in unobservable inputs will result in a higher estimated fair value, whereas isolated increases in unobservable inputs will result in a lower estimated fair value. The unobservable input for market convention is not sensitive to input movements. The projected liability cash flows used in the fair value measurement of our Level 3 embedded derivative are based on expected claim payments. If claim payments increase, the projected liability cash flows will increase, resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivative. Decreases in projected liability cash flows will result in an increase in the fair value of the embedded derivative.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, approximate fair value and are reported on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. A change in interest rates for ceded policy loans will not impact our financial position because the benefits and risks are fully ceded to reinsuring counterparties. 
 
 Miscellaneous Long-term Investments: Carrying amounts for tax credit partnerships equal the unamortized balance of our contractual commitments and approximate fair value. Our shares of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) common stock are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. 
 
 Long-term Debt: Fair values for long-term debt are obtained from independent pricing services or discounted cash flow analyses based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. 
 
 FHLB Funding Agreements: Funding agreements with the FHLB represent cash advances used for the purpose of investing in fixed maturity securities. Carrying amounts approximate fair value. 
 
 Unfunded Commitments to Investment Partnerships: Unfunded equity commitments represent amounts that we have committed to fund investment partnerships. These commitments are legally binding, subject to the partnerships meeting specified conditions. Carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate fair value.

 The carrying values of financial instruments such as short-term investments, cash and bank deposits, accounts and premiums receivable, accrued investment income, securities lending agreements, and short-term debt approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. As such, these financial instruments are not included in the above chart. 
 
 Fair values for insurance contracts other than investment contracts are not required to be disclosed. However, the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk, which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.

 Below-Investment-Grade Total Fixed Maturity Securities 
 
 The unrealized losses on investment-grade fixed maturity securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in market or sector credit spreads which occurred subsequent to the acquisition of the securities. Below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities are generally more likely to develop credit concerns than investment-grade securities. At September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses in our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities were generally due to credit spreads in certain industries or sectors and, to a lesser extent, credit concerns related to specific securities. For each specific security in an unrealized loss position, we believe that there are positive factors which mitigate credit concerns and that the securities for which we have not recorded a credit loss will recover in value. We have the ability and intent to continue to hold these securities to recovery of amortized cost less allowance for credit losses.

 individual investment-grade fixed maturity securities and individual below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position, of which investment-grade fixed maturity securities and below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities had been in an unrealized loss position continuously for over one year. 
 
 In determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security represents a credit loss, we evaluate the following factors: 
 
 Whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
 Whether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
 Whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments 
 The significance of the decline in value 
 Current and future business prospects and trends of earnings 
 The valuation of the security's underlying collateral 
 Relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles 
 Market conditions 
 Rating agency and governmental actions 
 Bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity 
 Adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments 
 Changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date 
 Any other key measures for the related security 
 
 While determining whether a credit loss exists is a judgmental area, we utilize a formal, well-defined, and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio, supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period. The process results in a thorough evaluation of investments and the recording of credit losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have a credit loss. We calculate the allowance for credit losses of fixed maturity securities based on the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition. When estimating future cash flows, we analyze the strength of the issuer s balance sheet, its debt obligations and near-term funding arrangements, cash flow and liquidity, the profitability of its core businesses, the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity, its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment, and its access to capital markets.

 At September 30, 2024, we had commitments of million to fund private placement fixed maturity securities, the amount of which may or may not be funded. 
 
 Variable Interest Entities 
 
 We invest in variable interests issued by variable interest entities. These investments, which are passive in nature, include minority ownership interests in private equity partnerships, tax credit partnerships, and special purpose entities. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of these investments in private equity partnerships, tax credit partnerships, and special purpose entities. For those variable interests that are not consolidated in our financial statements, we are not the primary beneficiary because we have neither the power to direct the activities that are most significant to economic performance nor the responsibility to absorb a majority of the expected losses. The determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is performed at the time of our initial investment and at the date of each subsequent reporting period. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of our variable interest entity investments that are not consolidated in our financial statements was million, comprised of million of tax credit partnerships and million of private equity partnerships. At December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of our variable interest entity investments that are not consolidated in our financial statements was million, comprised of million of tax credit partnerships and million of private equity partnerships. These variable interest entity investments are reported as other long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Mortgage Loans 
 
 Our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration. All of our mortgage loans are collateralized by commercial real estate. When issuing a new loan, our general policy is not to exceed a loan-to-value ratio, or the ratio of the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, of 75 percent. We update the loan-to-value ratios based on internal valuation of the collateral at least every three years for each loan, and properties undergo a general inspection at least every two years. Our general policy for newly issued loans is to have a debt

The allowance for expected credit losses was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan's contractual interest rate. We report accrued interest income for our mortgage loans as accrued investment income on our consolidated balance sheets, and the amount of the accrued income was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 The risk in our mortgage loan portfolio is primarily related to vacancy rates. Events or developments, such as economic conditions that impact the ability of the borrowers to ensure occupancy of the property, may have a negative effect on our mortgage loan portfolio, particularly to the extent that our portfolio is concentrated in an affected region or property type. An increase in vacancies increases the probability of default, which would negatively affect our expected losses in our mortgage loan portfolio. 
 
 We evaluate each of our mortgage loans individually for impairment and assign an internal quality rating based on a comprehensive rating system used to evaluate the risk of the loan. The factors we use to derive our internal quality ratings may include the following: 
 
 Loan-to-value ratio based on internal valuation of the property 
 Debt service coverage ratio based on current operating income 
 Property location, including regional economics, trends, and demographics 
 Age, condition, and construction quality of property 
 Current and historical occupancy of property

 million, which deferred the principal payment for months. This modification represented less than one percent of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio balance. There were troubled debt restructurings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held mortgage loans that were greater than 90 days past due regarding principal and/or interest payments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had loan foreclosures. 
 
 Other than our allowance for expected credit losses, we had specifically identified impaired mortgage loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, nor did we recognize any interest income on mortgage loans subsequent to impairment. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had million commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans. Consistent with how we determine the estimate of current expected credit losses for our funded mortgage loans each period, we estimate expected credit losses for loans that hav e not been funded but we are committed to fund at the end of each period. At September 30, 2024, we had million of expected credit losses related to unfunded commitments on our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2023, we had expected credit losses related to unfunded commitments on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Investment Real Estate 
 
 Our real estate held for the production of income balance was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and the associated accumulated depreciation was 130.8 million and 127.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We did not recognize any impairments related to our real estate during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a 3.0 million impairment related to certain of our real estate held for investment. 
 
 Our held for sale real estate balance was million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the associated accumulated depreciation was 54.2 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The estimated fair values less costs to sell are above the carrying values of the properties and we expect to close the sales of the properties within the next twelve months. 
 
 Transfers of Financial Assets 
 
 To manage our cash position more efficiently, we may enter into repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. We generally use repurchase agreements as a means to finance the purchase of invested assets or for short-term general business purposes until projected cash flows become available from our operations or existing investments. Our repurchase agreements are typically outstanding for less than days. We post collateral through our repurchase agreement transactions whereby the counterparty commits to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them to us at a later, specified date. The fair value of collateral posted is generally percent of the cash received. 
 
 Our investment policy also permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in short-term securities lending agreements. These agreements increase our investment income with minimal risk. Our securities lending policy requires that a minimum of percent of the fair value of the securities loaned be maintained as collateral. We may receive cash and/or securities as collateral under these agreements. Cash received as collateral is typically reinvested in short-term investments. If securities are received as collateral, we are not permitted to sell or re-post them. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities loaned to third parties under our securities lending program was million, for which we received collateral in the form of cash and securities of million and million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities loaned to third parties under our securities lending program was million, for which we received collateral in the form of cash and securities of million and million, respectively. We had outstanding repurchase agreements at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

 Certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are members of regional FHLBs. Membership, which requires that we purchase a minimum amount of FHLB common stock on which we receive dividends, provides access to low-cost funding.

 Offsetting of Financial Instruments 
 
 We enter into master netting agreements with each of our derivative's counterparties. These agreements provide for conditional rights of set-off upon the occurrence of an early termination event. An early termination event is considered a default, and it allows the non-defaulting party to offset its contracts in a loss position against any gain positions or payments due to the defaulting party. Under our agreements, default type events are defined as failure to pay or deliver as contractually agreed, misrepresentation, bankruptcy, or merger without assumption. See Note 5 for further discussion of collateral related to our derivative contracts. 
 
 We have securities lending agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions that post collateral to us in return for the use of our fixed maturity securities. A right of set-off exists that allows us to keep and apply collateral received in the event of default by the counterparty. Default within a securities lending agreement would typically occur if the counterparty failed to return the securities borrowed from us as contractually agreed. In addition, if we default by not returning collateral received, the counterparty has a right of set-off against our securities or any other amounts due to us.

This amount will be reclassified from AOCI into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item. The income statement line items that will be affected by this amortization are net investment income and interest and debt expense. Additional amounts that may be reclassified from AOCI into earnings to offset the earnings impact of foreign currency translation of hedged items are not estimable.

Cash settlements or collateral related to this embedded derivative are not required at any time during the reinsurance contract or at termination of the reinsurance contract. There are no credit-related counterparty triggers, and any accumulated embedded derivative gain or loss reduces to zero over time as the reinsured business winds down.

 percent at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The weighted average current discount rate was percent at September 30, 2023 compared to percent at December 31, 2022, with the increase due primarily to an increase in U.S. Treasury rates. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we completed our annual cash flow assumption review and updated certain of our assumptions used to develop the liability for future policy benefits which resulted in a net decrease to the liability. The decrease to the liability for future policy benefits was driven primarily by assumption updates in our Closed Block long-term care product line, Unum US group disability product line, Unum US individual disability product line, and the Colonial Life segment. The Closed Block long-term care assumption updates were primarily driven by an increase to expected premium rate increase approvals within our existing premium rate increase program, partially offset by lower than expected persistency on group policies. The Unum US group disability product line assumption updates were primarily related to claim resolution assumptions driven by favorable claim recovery trends, while the Unum US individual disability product line assumption updates were primarily driven by favorable claim incidence trends. The Colonial Life segment assumption updates were driven by improved claim cost assumptions. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2023, we completed our annual cash flow assumption review and updated certain of our assumptions used to develop the liability for future policy benefits which resulted in a net increase to the liability. The increase to the liability for future policy benefits was driven primarily by assumption updates in our Closed Block long-term care product line, partially offset by assumption updates in the Unum US group disability product line and in the Colonial Life segment. The long-term care assumption updates were primarily driven by lower expectations for active policy lapse and mortality assumptions, partially offset by an increase to expected premium rate increase approvals within our existing premium rate increase program. The Unum US group disability product line assumption updates were primarily related to claim resolution assumptions driven by favorable claim recovery trends, while the Colonial Life segment assumption updates were driven by improved claim cost assumptions and increases in policyholder lapse rates. 
 
 Actual variance from expected experience during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was due primarily to the Unum US group disability, Closed Block long-term care, and the Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment product lines. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the variance in the Unum US group disability product line was primarily due to higher than expected claim resolutions driven by recoveries. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the variance in the Closed Block long-term care product line was driven primarily by higher than expected claim incidence. Also impacting the variance for the first nine months of 2024 was lower than expected policy terminations, partially offset by higher than expected claim resolutions. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the variance in the Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment product line was driven primarily by lower than expected new claim incidence. Also contributing to the comparison for the first nine months of 2024 was higher than expected claim resolutions driven by recoveries. The variance for the first nine months of 2023 is also impacted by our Unum US individual disability product line which was driven primarily by lower than expected new claim incidence.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the cohorts for which net premiums exceeded the gross premiums within the Colonial Life segment had an immaterial impact to income before income tax. The impact to income for capped cohorts includes the impact of assumption updates. There were no other product lines with cohorts for which net premiums exceeded gross premiums for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.

 Note 10 - Segment Information - Continued 

 Unum International Colonial Life Closed Block Corporate Total Assets 
 
 We measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of "adjusted operating revenue" and "adjusted operating income" or "adjusted operating loss", which differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of investment gains or losses, the amortization of the cost of reinsurance, the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance, and reserve assumption updates as well as certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below. We believe adjusted operating revenue and adjusted operating income or loss are better performance measures and better indicators of the revenue and profitability and underlying trends in our business. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue, income before income tax, net income, or net loss. 
 
 Investment gains or losses primarily include realized investment gains or losses, expected investment credit losses, and gains or losses on derivatives. Investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of investment gains or losses. Although we may experience investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities. 
 
 Cash flow assumptions used to calculate our liability for future policy benefits are reviewed at least annually and updated, as needed, with the resulting impact reflected in net income. While the effects of these assumption updates are recorded in the reporting period in which the review is completed, these updates reflect experience emergence and changes to expectations spanning multiple periods. We believe that by excluding the impact of reserve assumption updates we are providing a more comparable and consistent view of our quarterly results. 
 
 We exited a substantial portion of our Closed Block individual disability product line through the two phases of the reinsurance transaction that were executed in December 2020 and March 2021. As a result, we exclude the amortization of the cost of reinsurance that we recognized upon the exit of the business related to the policies on claim status as well as the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance that resulted from the adoption of ASU 2018-12. Due to the execution of the second phase of the reinsurance transaction occurring after January 1, 2021, the transition date of ASU 2018-12, in accordance with the provisions of the ASU related to non-contemporaneous reinsurance, we were required to establish the ceded reserves using an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument as of the reinsurance transaction date in March 2021 which resulted in higher ceded reserves compared to that which was reported historically. However, the direct reserves for the block reinsured in the second phase were calculated using the original discount rate utilized as of the transition date. Both the direct and ceded reserves are then remeasured at each reporting period using a current discount rate reflective of an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument, with the changes recognized in OCI. While the total equity impact is neutral, the different original discount rates utilized for direct and ceded reserves result in disproportionate earnings impacts. The impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance will fluctuate depending on the magnitude of reserve changes during the period. We believe that the exclusion of these items provides a better view of our results from our ongoing businesses. 
 
 We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.

 Denominator (000s) Weighted Average Common Shares - Basic Dilution for Assumed Exercises of Nonvested Stock Awards Weighted Average Common Shares - Assuming Dilution Net Income Per Common Share Basic Assuming Dilution 
 
 We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In computing earnings per share assuming dilution, we include potential common shares that are dilutive (those that reduce earnings per share). We use the treasury stock method to account for the effect of nonvested stock success units and nonvested restricted stock units on the computation of diluted earnings per share. Under this method, the potential common shares from nonvested stock success units and nonvested restricted stock units will each have a dilutive effect, as individually measured, when the average market price of Unum Group common stock during the period exceeds the grant price of the nonvested stock success units and nonvested restricted stock units. The outstanding nonvested stock success units and nonvested restricted stock units have grant prices ranging from to . Potential common shares not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the impact would be antidilutive were zero million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. There were a de million potential common shares that were antidilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in the U.S. and imposes a one percent excise tax on corporate stock repurchases effective January 1, 2023. This excise tax is recorded as part of the cost basis of treasury stock and is assessed on the fair market value of stock repurchases reduced by the fair market value of any shares issued during the period.

 As a part of our share repurchase program, we periodically enter into accelerated share repurchase agreements (ASR). Under the terms of these agreements, we make a prepayment to a financial counterparty for which we receive an initial delivery of approximately 75 percent of the total Unum Group common stock to be delivered under the agreement. We simultaneously enter into a forward contract indexed to the price of Unum Group common stock, which subjects the transactions to a future price adjustment. Under the terms of the agreements, we are to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of Unum Group common stock during the term of the agreement, less a discount.

Under the facility agreement, we agreed to pay a semi-annual facility fee to the P-Caps Trust at a rate of 2.225 per year on the unexercised portion of the maximum amount of 2041 senior notes that we could issue and sell to the P-Caps Trust and to reimburse the P-Caps Trust for its expenses. 
 
 In October 2024, we exercised our issuance right in full under the facility agreement and issued million of the 2041 Senior Notes to the P-Caps Trust in exchange for the Trust Assets, thereby triggering our recognition of the 2041 Senior Notes on our consolidated balance sheets. The Trust Assets had a fair value of 273.5 million when the 2041 Senior Notes were issued. We directed the trustee of the P-Caps Trust to dissolve the P-Caps Trust and to deliver the 2041 Senior Notes to the beneficial holders of the P-Caps pro rata in respect of each P-Cap. The 2041 Senior Notes are callable at or above par and rank

 Executive Summary 
 
 Unum Group, a Delaware general business corporation, and its insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, which collectively with Unum Group we refer to as the Company, operate in the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, and, to a limited extent, in certain other countries. The principal operating subsidiaries in the United States are Unum Life Insurance Company of America (Unum America), Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company, The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company, Colonial Life Accident Insurance Company, Unum Insurance Company, Starmount Life Insurance Company, in the United Kingdom, Unum Limited, and in Poland, Unum Zycie TUiR S.A. (Unum Poland). We are a leading provider of financial protection benefits in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our products include disability, life, accident, critical illness, dental and vision, and other related services. We market our products primarily through the workplace. 
 
 We have three principal operating business segments: Unum US, Unum International, and Colonial Life. Our other segments are the Closed Block and Corporate segments. These segments are discussed more fully under "Segment Results" included herein in this Item 2. 
 
 The benefits we provide help the working world thrive throughout life's moments and protect people from the financial hardship of illness, injury, or loss of life. As a leading provider of employee benefits, we offer a broad portfolio of products and services through the workplace that provide support when it is needed most. 
 
 Specifically, we offer group, individual, voluntary, and dental and vision products as well as provide certain fee-based services. These products and services, which can be sold stand-alone or combined with other coverages, help employers of all sizes attract and retain the talented and capable workforce they need to succeed while protecting the incomes and livelihood of their employees. We believe employer-sponsored benefits are the most effective way to provide workers with access to information and options to protect their financial stability. Working people and their families, particularly those at lower and middle incomes, are perhaps the most vulnerable in today's economy yet are often overlooked by many providers of financial products and services. For many of these workers and families, employer-sponsored benefits are the primary defense against the potentially catastrophic financial impact of death, illness, or injury. 
 
 We have established a corporate culture consistent with the social value of our products and services. Because we see important links between the obligations we have to all of our stakeholders, we place a strong emphasis on operating with integrity and contributing to positive change in our communities. Accordingly, we are committed not only to meeting the needs of our customers who depend on us, but also to being accountable for our actions through sound and consistent business practices, a strong internal compliance program, a comprehensive risk management strategy, and an engaged employee workforce. 
 
 This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Part I, Item 1 contained in this Form 10-Q and with the "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" included below the Table of Contents, as well as the discussion, analysis, and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Part I, Items 1 and 1A, and Part II, Items 7, 7A, and 8 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures" contained herein in this Item 2 for a reconciliation of these items. 
 
 Our Unum US segment reported income before income tax and net investment gains and losses of 506.9 million and 1,249.6 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 486.6 million and 1,142.2 million in the same periods of 2023, which includes the reserve assumption updates that occurred during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. Excluding these items, our Unum US segment reported adjusted operating income of 363.3 million and 1,106.0 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 357.8 million and 1,013.4 million in the same periods of 2023, due to favorable benefits experience primarily in our group life product line as well as an increase in premium income, partially offset by higher commissions. Also impacting the comparison for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was unfavorable benefits experience in our group disability product line. The benefit ratio, excluding the reserve assumption updates, for our Unum US segment was 58.5 percent and 57.8 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 59.1 percent and 59.9 percent in third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Unum US sales decreased 9.7 percent and 2.7 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 
 Our Unum International segment reported income before income tax and net investment gains and losses of 32.8 million and 112.7 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 18.9 million and 100.8 million in the same periods of 2023, which includes the reserve assumption updates during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. Excluding these items, our Unum International segment reported adjusted operating income of 40.3 million and 120.2 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared to 36.8 million and 118.7 million in the same periods of 2023. Our Unum UK line of business reported adjusted operating income, which excludes the reserve assumption updates, of 29.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 28.4 million in the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher premium

 income as well as higher net investment income, partially offset by unfavorable benefits experience. Our Unum UK line of business reported adjusted operating income of 90.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 93.7 million in the same period of 2023, primarily due to lower net investment income and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher premium income. The benefit ratio for our Unum UK line of business, excluding the reserve assumption updates, was 69.5 percent and 69.0 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 67.4 percent and 69.4 percent in the same periods of 2023. Unum International sales, as measured in U.S. dollars, increased 26.5 percent and 8.4 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. Unum UK sales, as measured in local currency, increased 26.9 percent and 6.9 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 
 Our Colonial Life segment reported income before income tax and net investment gains and losses of 159.4 million and 390.0 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 183.6 million and 393.0 million in the same periods of 2023, which includes the reserve assumption updates during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. Excluding these items, our Colonial Life segment reported adjusted operating income of 113.4 million and 344.0 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared to 102.9 million and 312.3 million in the same periods of 2023, primarily due to higher premium income and favorable benefits experience, partially offset by higher commissions. Also impacting the comparison for the first nine months of 2024 is higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The benefit ratio, excluding the reserve assumption updates, for Colonial Life was 47.6 percent and 48.0 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 49.1 percent and 50.2 percent in the same periods of 2023. Colonial Life sales decreased 0.3 percent and 0.9 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 
 Our Closed Block segment reported income before income tax and net investment gains and losses of 193.1 million and 234.1 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to a loss before income tax and net investment gains and losses of 354.9 million and 284.7 million in the same periods of 2023, all of which include the amortization of the cost of reinsurance and the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction, as well as the reserve assumption updates during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. Excluding these items, our Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of 34.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, consistent with the same period of 2023, due primarily to an increase in net investment income, offset by lower premium income. Our Closed Block segment reported adjusting operating income of 110.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 143.6 million in the same period of 2023, due primarily to higher benefits in the long-term care product line and lower premium income, partially offset by an increase in net investment income. The net premium ratio for long-term care increased to 94.5 percent at September 30, 2024 from 93.4 percent at September 30, 2023. 
 
 A rising interest rate environment could positively impact our yields on new investments, but could also increase unrealized losses in our current holdings. Alternatively, a declining interest rate environment could negatively impact our yields on new investments, but could also reduce unrealized losses in our current holdings. As of September 30, 2024, we do not hold any securities with a decline in fair value below amortized cost which we intend to sell nor any securities for which it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in amortized cost. The net unrealized loss on our fixed maturity securities was 1.0 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.6 billion at December 31, 2023, with the decrease due primarily to a decrease in U.S. Treasury rates. The earned book yield on our investment portfolio was 4.41 percent for the first nine months of 2024 compared to a yield of 4.45 percent for full year 2023. 
 
 Additionally, a rising interest rate environment could result in reserve decreases while a declining interest rate environment could result in reserve increases, specific to our liability for future policy benefits, as the reserve discount rate assumptions used in the calculation of our liability are updated at each reporting date using a yield that is reflective of an upper-medium grade fixed income instrument, which is generally equivalent to a single-A interest rate matched to the duration of certain of our insurance liabilities. The discount rate assumptions on the liability for future policy benefits, net of reinsurance, as of September 30, 2024, were generally consistent with those as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 We believe our capital and financial positions are strong. At September 30, 2024, the risk-based capital (RBC) ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, calculated on a weighted average basis using the NAIC Company Action Level formula, was approximately 470 percent, which is above our long-term expectation. We repurchased 9.7 million shares and 3.9 million shares of Unum Group common stock under our share repurchase program, during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, at a cost of 504.8 million and 175.4 million, respectively, including commissions and excise tax. Our weighted average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution, equaled 186.9 million and 197.1 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 190.2 million and 198.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies had available holding company liquidity of

 2024 and 2023 Reserve Assumption Updates 
 
 During the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, we completed our annual cash flow assumption review which resulted in the following impacts to net income as a result of updating certain assumptions related to the liability for future policy benefits: 
 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30 
 (in millions of dollars) 2024 2023 Unum US Group Disability 90.0 121.0 Group Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment 13.0 Voluntary Benefits (12.2) 10.4 Individual Disability 52.8 (2.6) Total Unum US 143.6 128.8 Unum International (7.5) (17.9) Colonial Life 46.0 80.7 Closed Block Long-term Care 174.1 (368.1) Closed Block - All Other 1.2 (0.7) Total Closed Block 175.3 (368.8) Cash Flow Assumption Update Impacts to Income Before Income Tax 
 357.4 (177.2) Cash Flow Assumption Update Impacts to Net Income 
 282.6 (139.3) 
 
 2024 Significant Cash Flow Assumption Updates: 
 
 The cash flow assumption updates in our Unum US group long-term disability product line reduced our liability for future policy benefits by 90.0 million, due primarily to claim resolution assumptions driven by favorable claim recovery trends. 
 
 The cash flow assumption updates in our Unum US individual disability product line reduced our liability for future policy benefits by 52.8 million, due primarily to favorable claim incidence trends. 
 
 The cash flow assumption updates in our Colonial Life segment reduced our liability for future policy benefits by 46.0 million, due primarily to improved claim cost assumptions. 
 
 The cash flow assumption updates in our Closed Block segment were primarily driven by the long-term care product line which reduced our liability for future policy benefits by 174.1 million, due primarily to an increase to expected premium rate increase approvals within our existing premium rate increase program, partially offset by lower than expected persistency on group policies. 
 
 2023 Significant Cash Flow Assumption Updates: 
 
 The cash flow assumption updates in our Unum US group long-term disability product line reduced our liability for future policy benefits by 121.0 million, due primarily to sustained improvement in claim recovery trends. 
 
 91 

Table of Contents 

 The cash flow assumption updates in our Colonial Life segment reduced our liability for future policy benefits by 80.7 million, due primarily to improvement in certain of our claim cost assumptions and increased policyholder lapse rates. 
 
 The cash flow assumption updates in our Closed Block segment were primarily driven by the long-term care product line which increased our liability for future policy benefits by 368.1 million, due primarily to lower expectations for active policy lapse and mortality assumptions, partially offset by an increase to expected premium rate increase approvals within our existing premium rate increase program. 
 
 Loss on Legal Settlement 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we incurred a loss of 15.3 million before tax, or 12.1 million after tax, within our Corporate segment for the settlement of an employment-related matter. 4.9 million of the loss is recorded within compensation expense and 10.4 million of the loss is recorded within other expenses in the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act 
 
 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in the U.S. and includes certain corporate tax provisions effective January 1, 2023. The IRA imposes a new 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) on corporations that have average AFSI over 1.0 billion in any prior three-year period. Our company is an applicable corporation, but we have not recorded any CAMT for the third quarter or first nine months of 2024 and 2023. We do not expect that any CAMT incurred would impact earnings since it would be offset with a credit toward regular income tax in subsequent years. The IRA also imposes a one percent excise tax on the fair market value of corporate stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. This excise tax is recorded as part of the cost basis of treasury stock and is assessed on the fair market value of stock repurchases, reduced by the fair value of any shares issued during the period. We have recorded 2.0 million and 0.7 million of excise tax in stockholders' equity, as part of the cost basis of treasury stock, for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 4.8 million and 1.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 U.K. Tax Law Change 
 
 In June 2021, the Finance Act 2021 was enacted, resulting in a U.K. tax rate increase from 19 percent to 25 percent, effective April 1, 2023. 
 
 Global Minimum Tax 
 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has established model rules to ensure a minimum level of tax of 15 percent (Pillar Two) for multinational companies. Several jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, have adopted Pillar Two beginning on or after December 31, 2023. We have not recorded Pillar Two taxes as of September 30, 2024, and we do not expect material impacts in 2024. We will continue to monitor legislative developments and refine our estimates as necessary. 
 
 Consolidated Company Outlook 
 
 We believe our strategy of providing financial protection products at the workplace puts us in a position of strength. We continue to fulfill our corporate purpose of helping the working world thrive throughout life s moments by providing excellent service to people at their time of need. Our strategy remains centered on growing our core businesses, through investing and transforming our operations and technology to anticipate and respond to the changing needs of our customers, expanding into new adjacent markets through meaningful partnerships and effective deployment of our capital across our portfolio. 
 
 In 2023, we experienced increased earnings driven by the underlying strength of our business and expect positive operating trends in our core businesses to continue in 2024. The products and services we provide deliver significant value to employers, employees and their families, and we believe this will help drive sales and premium growth in 2024. 
 
 A rising interest rate environment could continue to positively impact our yields on new investments, but could also continue to create unrealized losses in our current holdings. A declining interest rate environment could negatively impact our yields on new investments but could also reduce unrealized losses in our current holdings. We also may continue to experience further volatility in miscellaneous investment income primarily related to changes in partnership net asset values as well as bond calls.

Table of Contents 

 As part of our discipline in pricing and reserving, we continuously monitor emerging claim trends and interest rates. We will continue to take appropriate pricing actions on new business and renewals that are reflective of the current environment and may continue to utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. 
 
 Our business is well-diversified by geography within our markets, industry exposures and case size, and we continue to analyze and employ strategies that we believe will help us navigate the current environment. These strategies allow us to maintain financial flexibility to support the needs of our businesses, while also returning capital to our shareholders. We have strong core businesses that have a track record of generating significant free cash flow, and we will continue to invest in our operations and expand into adjacent markets where we can best leverage our expertise and capabilities to capture market growth opportunities as those opportunities emerge. We believe that consistent operating results, combined with the implementation of strategic initiatives and the effective deployment of capital, will allow us to meet our financial objectives. 
 
 Further discussion is included in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 1 and in "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures," "Consolidated Operating Results," "Segment Results," "Investments," and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" contained herein in this Item 2. 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures 
 
 We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measure of "after-tax adjusted operating income" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of investment gains or losses, the amortization of the cost of reinsurance, the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance, and reserve assumption updates as well as certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below. Investment gains or losses primarily include realized investment gains or losses, expected investment credit losses, and gains or losses on derivatives. We believe after-tax adjusted operating income is a better performance measure and better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business. 
 
 Investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of investment gains or losses. Although we may experience investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities. 
 
 Cash flow assumptions used to calculate our liability for future policy benefits are reviewed at least annually and updated, as needed, with the resulting impact reflected in net income. While the effects of these assumption updates are recorded in the reporting period in which the review is completed, these updates reflect experience emergence and changes to expectations spanning multiple periods. We believe that by excluding the impact of reserve assumption updates we are providing a more comparable and consistent view of our quarterly results. 
 
 We exited a substantial portion of our Closed Block individual disability product line through the two phases of the reinsurance transaction that were executed in December 2020 and March 2021. As a result, we exclude the amortization of the cost of reinsurance that we recognized upon the exit of the business related to the policies on claim status as well as the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance that resulted from the adoption of ASU 2018-12. Due to the execution of the second phase of the reinsurance transaction occurring after January 1, 2021, the transition date of ASU 2018-12, in accordance with the provisions of the ASU related to non-contemporaneous reinsurance, we were required to establish the ceded reserves using an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument as of the reinsurance transaction date in March 2021 which resulted in higher ceded reserves compared to that which was reported historically. However, the direct reserves for the block reinsured in the second phase were calculated using the original discount rate utilized as of the transition date. Both the direct and ceded reserves are then remeasured at each reporting period using a current discount rate reflective of an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument, with the changes recognized in OCI. While the total equity impact is neutral, the different original discount rates utilized for direct and ceded reserves result in disproportionate earnings impacts. The impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance will fluctuate depending on the magnitude of reserve changes during the period. We believe that the exclusion of these items provides a better view of our results from our ongoing businesses.

Table of C ontents 

 We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability. 
 
 See "Executive Summary" contained herein in Item 2 and Notes 7 and 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 1 for further discussion regarding the items specified in the reconciliations below.

 We measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of "adjusted operating revenue" and "adjusted operating income" or "adjusted operating loss", which differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of investment gains and losses, the amortization of the cost of reinsurance, the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance, and reserve assumption updates as well as certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue, income before income tax, or net income.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements. 
 
 The accounting estimates deemed to be most critical to our financial position and results of operations are those related to the liability for future policy benefits, fair value of investments, pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, and contingent liabilities. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 For additional information, refer to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Part II, Item 8, and "Critical Accounting Estimates" in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Accounting Developments 
 
 For information on new accounting standards and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 1 for further information.

 Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the British pound sterling and the U.S. dollar for our U.K. operations, have an effect on our consolidated financial results. In periods when the pound weakens relative to the preceding period, translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period. In periods when the pound strengthens, translating pounds into dollars increases current period results relative to the prior period. 
 
 The weighted average pound/dollar exchange rate for our Unum UK line of business was 1.312 and 1.281 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 1.278 and 1.243 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. If the 2023 results for our U.K. operations had been translated at the weighted average exchange rates of 2024, our adjusted operating revenue would have been higher by approximately 7 million and 16 million, respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 and our adjusted operating income would have been higher by approximately 2 million and 3 million, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert pounds into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the U.K. 
 
 Premium income increased in each of our principal operating segments in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023, primarily due to favorable persistency and higher prior period sales. Premium income continues to decline, as expected, in our Closed Block segment. 
 
 Net investment income in the third quarter of 2024 was generally consistent compared to the same period of 2023 due primarily to an increase in the level of invested assets, partially offset by lower yield on invested assets and lower investment income from inflation index-linked bonds held by Unum UK. Net investment income was slightly higher in the first nine months of

T able of Contents 

 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 due primarily to an increase in the level of invested assets and higher miscellaneous investment income, primarily related to larger increases in the net asset value (NAV) on our private equity partnerships, partially offset by lower investment income from inflation index-linked bonds held by Unum UK. 
 
 Our investment gains and losses on fixed maturity securities include net losses on sales of 7.4 million and 37.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 28.6 million and 47.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Credit and impairment losses on fixed maturity securities were 1.5 million and 5.6 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. We did not recognize any credit or impairment losses on fixed maturity securities during the third quarter or first nine months of 2023. Also included in net investment gains and losses were changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement, which resulted in an investment loss of 0.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 and an investment gain of 9.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, respectively, and investment gains of 6.1 million and 14.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The changes in the embedded derivative are primarily driven by movements in credit spreads in the overall investment market. See Note 4 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 1 for further information on investment gains and losses. 
 
 Other income is primarily comprised of fee-based service products in the Unum US segment, which include leave management services and administrative services only business, and the underlying results and associated net investment income of certain assumed blocks of reinsured business in the Closed Block segment. 
 
 Overall benefits experience was favorable in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 relative to the same periods of 2023. The consolidated benefit ratio, which includes the remeasurement gain or loss, was 55.6 percent and 64.3 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 77.1 percent and 72.5 percent for the same prior year periods. Excluding the impact of the reserve assumption updates and non-contemporaneous reinsurance, the consolidated benefit ratio was 69.0 percent and 68.6 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 69.7 percent and 69.8 percent for the same prior year periods. The underlying benefits experience for each of our operating business segments is discussed more fully in "Segment Results" as follows. 
 
 Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 driven primarily by higher prior period sales in our principal operating segments. The increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 is due primarily to growth in the level of the deferred asset in our Unum US supplemental and voluntary and Unum US group disability product lines. Also impacting the increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 is growth in the level of the deferred asset in our Colonial Life Segment. 
 
 Other expenses and compensation expense, on a combined basis, increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 due primarily to a loss from a legal settlement, an increase in operational investments in our business, and growth in our fee-based service products. Also impacting the comparison for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 were increases in employee-related costs. 
 
 Our effective income tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were 20.7 percent and 20.8 percent of income before income tax, respectively, compared to 22.8 percent and 21.3 percent for the same prior year periods. Our effective income tax rates were generally consistent with the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent in effect for the third quarter of 2024 and for the first nine months of 2023 and 2024. Our effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percentage for the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to interest on uncertain tax positions.

 Consolidated Sales Results 
 
 Shown below are sales results for our three principal operating business segments. 
 (in millions) Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change 2023 Unum US 154.3 (9.7) 170.9 741.6 (2.7) 762.1 Unum International 38.2 26.5 30.2 148.1 8.4 136.6 Colonial Life 120.9 (0.3) 121.3 346.8 (0.9) 350.1 
 
 Sales shown in the preceding chart generally represent the annualized premium income on new sales which we expect to receive and report as premium income during the next 12 months following or beginning in the initial quarter in which the sale is reported, depending on the effective date of the new sale. Sales do not correspond to premium income reported as revenue in accordance with GAAP. This is because new annualized sales premiums reflect current sales performance and what we expect to recognize as premium income over a 12 month period, while premium income reported in our financial statements is reported on an "as earned" basis rather than an annualized basis and also includes renewals and persistency of in-force policies written in prior years as well as current new sales. 
 
 Sales, persistency of the existing block of business, employment and salary growth, and the effectiveness of a renewal program are indicators of growth in premium income. Trends in new sales, as well as existing market share, also indicate the potential for growth in our respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price levels and new product offerings. Sales results may fluctuate significantly due to case size and timing of sales submissions. 
 
 See "Segment Results" as follows for a discussion of sales by segment. 

Segment Results 
 
 Our reporting segments are comprised of the following: Unum US, Unum International, Colonial Life, Closed Block, and Corporate. 
 
 In describing our results, we may at times note certain items and exclude the impact on financial ratios and metrics to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur. We also measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of "adjusted operating revenue" and "adjusted operating income" or "adjusted operating loss", which differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of investment gains and losses and certain other items. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue, income before income tax, or net income. See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" contained herein in this Item 2. 

Unum US Segment 
 
 The Unum US segment is comprised of the group disability, group life and accidental death and dismemberment, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business. The group disability line of business includes long-term and short-term disability, medical stop-loss, and fee-based service products. The supplemental and voluntary line of business includes voluntary benefits, individual disability, and dental and vision products. These products, excluding medical stop loss which is no longer actively marketed as of the third quarter of 2024, are marketed through our field sales personnel who work in conjunction with independent brokers and consultants.

 benefits and individual disability product lines. Also impacting the comparison for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was the continued impacts from the partial recapture of a previously ceded block of business in the individual disability product line. Net investment income increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to an increase in the yield on invested assets. Other income decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, due primarily to a prior year net gain on the partial recapture of a previously ceded block of business in the individual disability product line. 
 
 The benefit ratio, excluding the impacts of the reserve assumption updates, for voluntary benefits was unfavorable in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 due to unfavorable experience in the critical illness and life product lines. The benefit ratio, excluding the impacts of the reserve assumption updates, for voluntary benefits was unfavorable in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 due to less favorable experience in the critical illness, hospital indemnity, and accident product lines. The benefit ratio, excluding the impacts of the reserve assumption updates, for the individual disability product line was favorable in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 due primarily to favorable recoveries, partially offset by higher claim size. The benefit ratio for the dental and vision product line was unfavorable in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 due primarily to higher claims incidence and higher average claim size.

The amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 due primarily to increased lapses in certain older product offerings in the voluntary benefits product line and growth in the level of the deferred assets in all product lines. The other expense ratio was favorable in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 due to our focus on expense management and operating efficiencies. The other expense ratio was generally consistent in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023.

 Segment Outlook 
 
 We remain committed to offering consumers a broad set of financial protection benefit products at the worksite. During 2024, we will continue to invest in a unique customer experience defined by simplicity, empathy, and deep industry expertise through the increased utilization of digital capabilities and technology to enhance enrollment, underwriting, the client administration experience, and claims processing. In addition, we will focus on strategically driven sales by enhancing the connectivity, alignment, and support for brokers and technology partners. With respect to smaller employers, we will continue to provide a

Table of Contents 

 comprehensive set of consumer-focused products, enhance our distribution model, and utilize our digital tools to bring industry leading enrollment capabilities and a fully integrated customer experience. Our differentiated offerings and market leading leave management services provide substantial growth opportunities, particularly with larger employers, and stronger persistency in our core products. We believe our active client management, integrated customer experience across our product lines, and strong risk management, will enable us to continue to grow our market over the long-term. 
 
 We expect strong adjusted operating income in 2024 with continued premium growth and claim experience in line with 2023. We expect premium growth to be driven by improved persistency in most lines as well as continued strong sales momentum. We expect the group disability market to remain competitive which may impact our pricing and renewal premium levels. We expect favorable group disability claim experience to continue in 2024, driven by strong operational performance. We also expect group life and voluntary benefits claim experience to be mostly stable. We expect a stable operating expense ratio as our investments in our people and capabilities are offset by efficiencies gained from our strategic initiatives. 
 
 A rising interest rate environment could continue to positively impact our yields on new investments but could also continue to create further unrealized losses in our current holdings. A declining interest rate environment could negatively impact yields on new investments but could also reduce unrealized losses in our current holdings. Our net investment income may continue to be impacted by volatility in miscellaneous investment income. 
 
 As part of our discipline in pricing and reserving, we continuously monitor emerging claim trends and interest rates. We will continue to take appropriate pricing actions on new business and renewals that are reflective of the current environment. 
 
 We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and adjust our business plans accordingly.

 Foreign Currency Translation 
 
 The functional currencies of Unum UK and Unum Poland are the British pound sterling and Polish zloty, respectively. Premium income, net investment income, claims, and expenses are received or paid in the functional currency, and we hold functional currency-denominated assets to support functional currency-denominated policy liabilities. We translate functional currency-denominated financial statement items into dollars for our consolidated financial reporting. We translate income statement items using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate balance sheet items using the exchange rate at the end of the period. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets.

Table of Contents 

 Fluctuations in exchange rates impact Unum International's reported financial results and our consolidated financial results. In periods when the functional currency strengthens relative to the preceding period, translation increases current period results relative to the prior period. In periods when the functional currency weakens, translation decreases current period results relative to the prior period.

Our investments in inflation index-linked bonds support the claim liabilities associated with certain group policies that provide for inflation-linked increases in policy benefits. The change in net investment income attributable to these index-linked bonds is partially offset by a change in policy benefits related to the inflation index-linked group long-term disability and group life policies. 
 
 The benefit ratio, excluding the impacts of reserve assumption updates, was unfavorable in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 due primarily to higher incidence in the group long-term disability and group life product lines, partially offset by favorable incidence in the supplemental product line and favorable recoveries in the group long-term disability product line.

 Group long-term disability sales decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, driven primarily by lower sales to new customers in the core market, which we define as employee groups with less than 500 employees, partially offset by higher sales to new customers in the large case market.

 Segment Outlook 
 
 We are committed to driving growth in the Unum International segment and will build on the capabilities that we believe will generate growth and profitability in our businesses over the long term. In 2024, we will focus on scaling our business and broadening our product portfolio. For our Unum UK line of business, achieving growth remains a priority, and we will continue to focus on delivering a best in class health and wellbeing service to improve retention of our key customers and drive growth across our product offerings. We will also accelerate premium growth by focusing on both the broker experience and customer engagement, while maintaining our disciplined approach to pricing. Within our Unum Poland line of business, we will drive growth by expanding our distribution and the direct to employer channel. We will also continue to invest in digital capabilities, technology, and product enhancements which we believe will drive sustainable growth over the long term. 
 
 In 2024, we expect sales and premium growth to continue, alongside stable claim experience. We recognize that 2023 earnings benefited from inflation linked income, which we expect will continue to decrease in 2024 and could pressure earnings growth. We may see impacts to net investment income and fluctuations in our benefit ratio as inflation continues to moderate. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and adjust our business plans accordingly.

 Closed Block Segment 
 
 The Closed Block segment consists of group and individual long-term care and other insurance products no longer actively marketed. We discontinued offering individual long-term care in 2009 and group long-term care in 2012. Other insurance products include individual disability, group pension, individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, and other miscellaneous product lines.

Table of Contents 

 Net investment income was higher during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 relative to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to an increase in the level of invested assets. Also impacting the comparison for the first nine months of 2024 relative to the same period of 2023 was higher miscellaneous investment income, primarily related to larger increases in the NAV on our private equity partnerships. 
 
 Other income primarily includes the underlying results and associated net investment income of certain assumed blocks of business. 
 
 Policy benefits including remeasurement loss (gain), excluding the impacts of the reserve assumption updates and non-contemporaneous reinsurance, were generally consistent during the third quarter of 2024 relative to the same period of 2023. Policy benefits including remeasurement loss (gain), excluding the impacts of the reserve assumption updates and non-contemporaneous reinsurance, were unfavorable in the first nine months of 2024 relative to the same period of 2023 driven primarily by the increase in the current period benefit expense resulting from the higher net premium ratio and the impact of capped cohorts in the long - term care product line. The net premium ratio for long-term care increased to 94.5 percent at September 30, 2024 from 93.4 percent at September 30, 2023 due primarily to policyholder terminations and the assumption updates in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 The other expense ratio, excluding the amortization of the cost of reinsurance, was higher in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 due primarily to an increase in operational investments in our business and a decline in expense allowances related to the ceded block of individual disability business. Also contributing to the higher other expense ratio, excluding the amortization of the cost of reinsurance, in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was an increase in employee-related costs. 
 
 Individual Disability Reinsurance Transaction 
 
 As shown in the chart above, we exclude from income before income tax and net investment gains and losses, the amortization of the cost of reinsurance and the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction, where we ceded a significant portion of this business. The cost of reinsurance continues to be amortized over a period of approximately 22 years, on a declining trajectory generally consistent with the expected run-off pattern of the ceded reserves. As a result of the execution of the second phase of the reinsurance transaction occurring after January 1, 2021, the transition date of ASU 2018-12, in accordance with the provisions of the ASU related to non-contemporaneous reinsurance, we were required to establish the ceded reserves using an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument as of the reinsurance transaction date in March 2021 which resulted in higher ceded reserves compared to that which was reported historically. However, the direct reserves for the block reinsured in the second phase were calculated using the original discount rate utilized as of the transition date. Both the direct and ceded reserves are then remeasured at each reporting period using a current discount rate reflective of an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument, with the changes recognized in OCI. While the total equity impact is neutral, the different original discount rates utilized for direct and ceded reserves result in disproportionate earnings impacts. The impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance will fluctuate depending on the magnitude of reserve changes during the period. The decrease in the effects of non-contemporaneous reinsurance treatment in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 is due to expected run out of the ceded block which resulted in a smaller net change in reserves in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 
 Segment Outlook 
 
 We will continue to execute on our well-defined strategy of implementing long-term care premium rate increases, efficient capital management, improved financial analysis, and operational effectiveness. We will continue to explore structural options to enhance financial flexibility. We continue to file requests with various state insurance departments for premium rate increases on certain of our individual and group long-term care policies which reflect assumptions as of the date of filings. In states for which a rate increase is submitted and approved, we routinely provide customers options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needs. Despite continued anticipated premium rate increases in our long-term care business, we expect overall premium income and adjusted operating revenue to decline over the long term as these closed blocks of business wind down. We will likely experience volatility in net investment income due to fluctuations of miscellaneous investment income, driven by the allocation towards alternative assets, primarily private equity partnership investments, in the long-term care product line portfolio. We record changes in our share of the NAV of the partnerships in net investment income. We receive financial information related to our investments in partnerships and generally record investment income on a one-quarter lag in accordance with our accounting policy. As these net asset values are volatile and can fluctuate materially with changes in market economic conditions, there may possibly be significant

 movements up or down in future periods as conditions change. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and adjust our business plans, including utilization of derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. 
 
 Profitability of our long-tailed products is affected by claims experience related to mortality and morbidity, resolutions, investment returns, premium rate increases, and persistency. The net premium ratio represents the ratio of future expected benefits and related expenses to future expected gross premiums using the original discount rate. The long-term care benefits experience may continue to have quarterly volatility, particularly in the near term as our claim block matures and as we continue the implementation of premium rate increases. Claim resolution rates which reflect the probability that a disability or long-term care claim will close due to recovery or death of the insureds, are very sensitive to operational and external factors and can be volatile. Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period. It is possible that variability in any of our reserve assumptions, including, but not limited to, mortality, morbidity, resolutions, premium rate increases, benefit change elections, and persistency, could result in a material impact to our reserves. 
 
 As a result of the execution of the reinsurance transaction related to our Closed Block individual disability line of business, we have fully ceded a significant portion of this business. We expect that earnings will continue to be impacted by the amortization of the cost of reinsurance and the impacts of non-contemporaneous reinsurance, but we anticipate these impacts will decline over time with the run-off pattern of the reserves.

 Adjusted operating loss, excluding the loss on legal settlement, increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 relative to the same periods of 2023 due primarily to decreased net investment income, which was driven by increased allocations to our lines of business. See "Executive Summary" contained herein this Item 2 and Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 1 for further discussion on the loss on legal settlement. 
 
 Segment Outlook 
 
 We expect to continue to generate excess capital on an annual basis through the statutory earnings in our insurance subsidiaries and believe we are well positioned with flexibility to preserve our capital strength while also returning capital to our shareholders. We may experience volatility in net investment income due to changes in the prevailing interest rates as well as both the composition and level of invested assets.

 Investments 
 
 Overview 
 
 Investment activities are an integral part of our business, and profitability is significantly affected by investment results. We segment our invested assets into portfolios that support our various product lines. Generally, our investment strategy for our portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of our businesses and to manage interest rate risk. We seek to earn investment income while assuming credit risk in a prudent and selective manner, subject to constraints of quality, liquidity, diversification, and regulatory considerations. Our overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of our insurance products. Assets are invested predominantly in fixed maturity securities. 
 
 We may redistribute investments among our different lines of business or sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds, when necessary, to adjust the cash flow and/or duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability portfolios. Asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy. Cash flows from the in-force asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios. These results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates. Testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy, as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes. Although we test the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios as part of our modeling, the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive, and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk. Our determination of investment strategy relies on long-term measures such as asset adequacy analysis and the relationship between the portfolio yields supporting our various product lines and the aggregate discount rate assumptions embedded in the reserves. We also use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments for managing interest rate risk and the risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
 
 Our investment portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector. We have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations and allow us to hold our securities through periods where significant decreases in fair value occur. We believe our emphasis on risk management in our investment portfolio has positioned us well and generally reduced the volatility in our results.

 The following two tables show the length of time our investment-grade and below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities portfolios had been in a gross unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 and at the end of the prior four quarters. The relationships of the current fair value to amortized cost are not necessarily indicative of the fair value to amortized cost relationships for the securities throughout the entire time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position nor are they necessarily indicative of the relatio nships after September 30, 2024. The decrease in the net unrealized loss on fixed maturity securities during the third quarter of 2024 was due primarily to a decrease in U.S. Treasury rates.

 At September 30, 2024, we held one below investment-grade fixed maturity security with a gross unrealized loss greater than 10.0 million. The security is a utilities company and had a fair value of 34.2 million and a gross unrealized loss of 11.2 million. 
 
 Unrealized losses on investment-grade fixed maturity securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in market or sector credit spreads which occurred subsequent to the acquisition of the securities. Below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities are generally more likely to develop credit concerns than investment-grade securities. At September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses in our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities were generally due to higher interest rates, credit spreads in certain industries or sectors and, to a lesser extent, credit concerns related to specific securities. For each specific security in an unrealized loss position, we believe that there are positive factors which mitigate credit concerns and that the securities for which we have not recorded a credit loss will recover in value. We have the ability and intent to continue to hold these securities to recovery of amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. 
 
 We had no individual net investment losses of 10.0 million or greater from credit losses or sales of fixed maturity securities during the first nine months of 2024 or 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost net of allowance for credit losses and fair value of our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities w as 1,531.9 million and 1,496.3 million , respectively, and our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities as a percentage of our total investment portfolio decreased to 3.2 percent at September 30, 2024 from 3.3 percent at December 31, 2023 on a fair value basis. Below-investment-grade securities are inherently riskier than investment-grade securities since the risk of default by the issuer, by definition and as exhibited by bond rating, is higher. Also, the secondary market for certain below-investment-grade issues can be highly illiquid. Additional downgrades may occur, but we do not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from our investments in below-investment-grade securities, nor do we expect these investments to adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturity.

 Fixed Maturity Securities - Foreign Exposure 
 
 Our investments in issuers in foreign countries are chosen for specific portfolio management purposes, including asset and liability management and portfolio diversification across geographic lines and sectors to minimize non-market risks. In our approach to investing in fixed maturity securities, specific investments within approved countries and industry sectors are evaluated for their market position and specific strengths and potential weaknesses. For each security, we consider the political, legal, and financial environment of the sovereign entity in which an issuer is domiciled and operates. The country of domicile is based on consideration of the issuer's headquarters, in addition to location of the assets and the country in which the majority of sales and earnings are derived. We do not have exposure to foreign currency risk, as the cash flows from these investments are either denominated in currencies or hedged into currencies to match the related liabilities. We continually evaluate our foreign investment risk exposure. 
 
 Mortgage Loans 
 
 The carrying value of our mortgage loan portfolio was 2,238.9 million and 2,318.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Our investments in mortgage loans are carried at amortized cost less an allowance for expected credit losses which was 16.5 million and 10.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Our mortgage loan portfolio is comprised entirely of commercial mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types. 
 
 Due to conservative underwriting, the incidence of non-performing mortgage loans and foreclosure activity continues to be low. Other than our allowance for expected credit losses, we held no specifically identified impaired mortgage loans at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. See Note 4 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 1 for further discussion of our mortgage loan portfolio and the allowance for expected credit losses. 
 
 Private Equity Partnerships 
 
 The carrying value of our investments in private equity partnerships was 1,428.0 million and 1,326.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These partnerships are passive in nature and represent funds that are primarily invested in private credit, private equity, and real assets. The carrying value of the partnerships is based on our share of the partnership's NAV and changes in the carrying value are recorded as a component of net investment income. We receive financial information related to our investments in partnerships and generally record investment income on a one-quarter lag in accordance with our accounting policy. We recorded net investment income totaling 19.6 million and 72.6 million for the partnerships in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. The majority of our investments in partnerships are not redeemable. Distributions received from the funds arise from income generated by the underlying investments as well as the liquidation of the underlying investments. There is generally not a public market for these investments. We had 805.6 million of commitments for additional investments in the partnerships at September 30, 2024 which may or may not be funded. See Note 3 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 1 for further discussion of our private equity partnerships. 
 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
 We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage interest rate risk, risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities, foreign currency risk, and equity risk. Historically, we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps, current and forward currency swaps, forward benchmark interest rate locks, currency forward contracts, forward contracts on specific fixed income securities, and total return swaps. During the first nine months of 2024, we entered into 806 million of notional forward U.S. Treasury interest rate locks in our long-term care product line to manage our reinvestment risk. Credit exposure on derivatives is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, including accrued interest receivable less collateral held. Our credit exposure was 0.3 million at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of fixed maturity securities and cash collateral received from our counterparties was 30.9 million and 3.4 million, respectively. The carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was 50.6 million at September 30, 2024. There was no cash posted as collateral to our counterparties at September 30, 2024. We believe that our credit risk is mitigated by our use of multiple counterparties, all of which have an investment-grade credit rating, and by our use of cross-collateralization agreements. See Note 5 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 1 for further discussion of our derivatives.

Our exposure to non-current investments, defined as invested assets which are delinquent as to interest and/or principal payments, totaled 3.8 million on a fair value basis at September 30, 2024. We had no exposure to non-current investments at December 31, 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 
 
 Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations, principally in our insurance subsidiaries. Premium and investment income, as well as maturities and sales of invested assets, provide the primary sources of cash. Debt and/or securities offerings provide additional sources of liquidity. Cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits, costs of acquiring new business (principally commissions), operating expenses, and taxes, as well as purchases of new investments. 
 
 We have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations. We attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business. However, deterioration in the credit market may delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner and adversely impact the price we receive for such securities, which may negatively impact our cash flows. Furthermore, if we experience defaults on securities held in the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries, this will negatively impact statutory capital, which could reduce our insurance subsidiaries' capacity to pay dividends to our holding companies. A reduction in dividends to our holding companies could force us to seek external financing to avoid impairing our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or meet our debt and other payment obligations. 
 
 Our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments, and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities. A decrease in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations. However, our historical pattern of benefits paid to revenues is generally consistent, even during cycles of economic downturns, which serves to minimize liquidity risk. 
 
 The liquidity requirements of the holding company Unum Group include common stock dividends, interest and debt service, and ongoing investments in our businesses. Unum Group's liquidity requirements are met by assets held by Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies, dividends from primarily our insurance subsidiaries, and issuance of common stock, debt, or other capital securities and borrowings from our existing credit facility, as needed. As of September 30, 2024, Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies had available holding company liquidity of 1,393.0 million that was held primarily in bank deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds and asset backed securities. No significant restrictions exist on our ability to use or access funds in any of our U.S. or foreign intermediate holding companies. Dividends repatriated from our foreign subsidiaries are eligible for 100 percent exemption from U.S. income tax but may be subject to withholding tax and/or tax on foreign currency gain or loss. 
 
 As part of our capital deployment strategy, we may repurchase shares of Unum Group's common stock, as authorized by our board of directors. The timing and amount of repurchase activity is based on market conditions and other considerations, including the level of available cash, alternative uses for cash, and our stock price. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 9.7 million shares at a cost of 500.0 million excluding commissions and excise tax. 
 
 Our board of directors has authorized the following repurchase programs:

 Cash Available from Subsidiaries 
 
 Unum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries depend on payments from subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders, to pay debt obligations, and/or to pay expenses. These payments by our insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, operating and investment management fees, and/or interest payments on loans from the parent to a subsidiary. 
 
 Restrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any 12-month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities. For life insurance companies domiciled in the U.S., that limitation generally equals, depending on the state of domicile, either ten percent of an insurer's statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations, excluding realized capital gains and losses, of the preceding year. The payment of dividends to a parent company from a life insurance subsidiary is generally further limited to the amount of unassigned funds. 
 
 In connection with a financial examination of Unum America, which closed at the end of the second quarter of 2020, the Maine Bureau of Insurance (MBOI) concluded that Unum America s long-term care statutory reserves were deficient by 2,100 million as of December 31, 2018, the financial statement date of the examination period. The amount reserves are deficient may increase or decrease over time based on changes in assumed reinvestment rates, policyholder inventories, premium rate increase activity, and the underlying growth in the locked in statutory reserve basis as well as updates to other long term actuarial assumptions. The MBOI granted permission to Unum America on May 1, 2020, to phase in the additional statutory reserves over seven years beginning with year-end 2020 and ending with year-end 2026. The calculation of the premium deficiency reserve (PDR) reflects specific assumptions set by the MBOI and results in significant margin above Unum America s best estimate assumptions. As of December 31, 2023, the PDR calculated under the basis resulting from the MBOI examination was 1,604 million, which has been fully recognized. Our long-term care reserves and financial results reported under generally accepted accounting principles were not affected by the MBOI s examination conclusion. 
 
 Unum America cedes blocks of long-term care business to Fairwind Insurance Company (Fairwind), which is an affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiary domiciled in the United States. The ability of Fairwind to pay dividends to Unum Group will depend on its satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured by Fairwind. Fairwind did not pay dividends in 2023 nor do we anticipate that Fairwind will pay dividends in 2024. Unum Group did not make any capital contributions to Fairwind during the first nine months of 2024, nor do we expect to make capital contributions for the remainder of the year. 
 
 The ability of Unum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries also depends on additional factors such as RBC ratios and capital adequacy and/or solvency requirements, funding growth objectives at an affiliate level, and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings. The RBC ratios for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries at September 30, 2024 are in line with our expectations and are significantly above the level that would require state regulatory action. 
 
 Unum Group and/or certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries may also receive dividends from our U.K. subsidiaries, the payment of which may be subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance in the U.K. Unum Limited is subject to the requirements of Solvency II, a European Union (EU) directive that is part of retained UK law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which prescribes capital requirements and risk management standards for the European insurance industry. Our U.K. holding company is also subject to the Solvency II requirements relevant to insurance holding companies while, together with certain of its subsidiaries including Unum Limited, the group (the Unum UK Solvency II Group) is subject to group supervision under Solvency II. The Unum UK Solvency II Group received approval from the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) to use its own internal model for calculating regulatory capital and also received approval for certain associated regulatory permissions including transitional relief as the Solvency II capital regime continues to be implemented. In connection with the U.K. s exit from the EU, the U.K. government is reviewing the regulatory framework of financial services companies. Certain changes have already been finalized, which have improved the solvency position of our U.K. business at September 30, 2024. Additionally, the remaining pending proposals may lead to future changes in the solvency position of our U.K. business. 
 
 The payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiary's board of directors. 
 
 During 2024, we intend to maintain a level of capital in our insurance subsidiaries above the applicable capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins. 
 129 

Table of Contents 

Insurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from non-insurance subsidiaries except where the non-insurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by Unum Group, which does not apply to our current entity structure. 
 
 Funding for Employee Benefit Plans 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made contributions of 59.6 million and 3.8 million to our U.S. and U.K. defined contribution plans, respectively, and expect to make additional contributions of approximately 18 million and 1 million during the remainder of 2024. We had no regulatory contribution requirements for our U.S. and U.K. qualified defined benefit pension plans and made no voluntary contributions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We do not expect to have regulatory contribution requirements for our U.S. and U.K. qualified defined benefit pension plans during the remainder of 2024, but we reserve the right to make voluntary contributions during the remainder of 2024. We have met all minimum pension funding requirements set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. We have estimated our future funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and under applicable U.K. law and do not believe that any future funding requirements will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity. See Note 11 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion. 
 
 Debt, Term Loan Facility, Credit Facilities and Other Sources of Liquidity 
 
 Our long-term debt balance at September 30, 2024 was 3,470.4 million, net of deferred debt issuance costs of 32.3 million, and is comprised of our unsecured senior notes, unsecured medium-term notes, and junior subordinated debt securities. 
 
 In June 2024, we issued 400.0 million of 6.000 senior notes due 2054. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. A portion of the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay the 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness under our senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility, which was terminated upon repayment. The remaining balance of the net proceeds is expected to be used for general corporate purposes. 
 
 During November 2021, we entered into a 20-year facility agreement with a Delaware statutory trust (the P-Caps Trust), in connection with the sale by the P-Caps Trust of 400.0 million of pre-capitalized trust securities (P-Caps) in a Rule 144A private placement. The P-Caps Trust invested the proceeds from the sale of the P-Caps in a portfolio of principal and interest strips of U.S. Treasury securities (the Trust Assets). The facility agreement gave us the right to issue and require the P-Caps Trust to purchase, on one or more occasions, up to 400.0 million of our 4.046 senior notes due 2041 (the 2041 Senior Notes) in exchange for the Trust Assets. Under the facility agreement, we agreed to pay a semi-annual facility fee to the P-Caps Trust at a rate of 2.225 per year on the unexercised portion of the maximum amount of 2041 senior notes that we could issue and sell to the P-Caps Trust and to reimburse the P-Caps Trust for its expenses. 
 
 In October 2024, we exercised our issuance right in full under the facility agreement and issued 400.0 million of the 2041 Senior Notes to the P-Caps Trust in exchange for the Trust Assets, thereby triggering our recognition of the 2041 Senior Notes on our consolidated balance sheets. The Trust Assets had a fair value of 273.5 million when the 2041 Senior Notes were issued. We directed the trustee of the P-Caps Trust to dissolve the P-Caps Trust and to deliver the 2041 Senior Notes to the beneficial holders of the P-Caps pro rata in respect of each P-Cap. The 2041 Senior Notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2041 Senior Notes and subsequent sale of the Trust Assets are expected to be used for future share repurchases. See Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 1. 
 
 We have a five-year 500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders which is currently scheduled to expire in April 2027. We may request that the lenders aggregate commitments of 500.0 million under the facility be increased by up to an additional 200.0 million. Certain of our traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries may also borrow under the credit facility, subject to an unconditional guarantee by Unum Group. At September 30, 2024, there were no borrowed amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and letters of credit totaling 0.4 million had been issued. 
 
 We have a five-year 75 million senior unsecured standby letter of credit facility with a different syndicate of lenders, pursuant to which a syndicated letter of credit was issued in favor of Unum Limited (as beneficiary), our U.K. insurance subsidiary, and is available for drawings up to 75 million until its scheduled expiration in July 2026. We have an additional five-year, 75 million senior standby letter of credit facility pursuant to which a standby letter of credit was issued in favor of Unum Limited 
 130 

Table of Contents 

 (as beneficiary), our U.K. insurance subsidiary, and is available for drawings up to 75.0 million until its scheduled expiration in December 2028. In connection with and as security for the senior standby letter of credit facility, we granted to the issuer of the standby letter of credit the right to exercise, if an event of default occurred and was continuing, the issuance right under the facility agreement with the P-Caps Trust, up to a maximum of 200.0 million. In October 2024, prior to our exercise of the issuance right under the facility agreement, the assigned issuance right was forfeited in its entirety. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, no amounts have been borrowed under the standby credit facilities or letters of credit. 
 
 There are no significant financial covenants associated with any of our debt obligations other than our borrowings under the credit facilities, which are subject to financial covenants, negative covenants, and events of default that are customary. Each credit facility includes financial covenants based on our leverage ratio and consolidated net worth as well as covenants that limit subsidiary indebtedness. We continually monitor our debt covenants to ensure we remain in compliance. We have not observed any current trends that would cause a breach of any debt covenants. 
 
 See "Debt, Term Loan Facility, Credit Facilities and Other Sources of Liquidity" and Note 10 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained in Part II, Items 7 and 8, respectively, of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion. 
 
 Shelf Registration 
 
 We maintain a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares, stock purchase contracts, units and warrants. The shelf registration enables us to raise funds from the offering of any securities covered by the shelf registration as well as any combination thereof, subject to market conditions and our capital needs. 

Commitments 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had commitments of 38.0 million to fund investments in private placement fixed maturity securities and 805.6 million to fund private equity partnerships. In addition, we had 28.5 million of commercial mortgage loan commitments. 
 
 With respect to our commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements, see the discussion under "Cash Requirements" in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, there were no substantive changes in our commitments, contractual obligations, or other off-balance sheet arrangements other than the changes noted herein. 
 
 Transfers of Financial Assets 
 
 Our investment policy permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in short-term securities lending agreements, which increases our investment income with minimal risk. We account for all of our securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements as secured borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, we held 25.8 million of cash collateral from securities lending agreements. The average cash collateral balance during the first nine months of 2024 was 46.2 million, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was 133.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we held 34.4 million of off-balance sheet securities lending agreements which were collateralized by securities that we were neither permitted to sell nor control. The average balance of these off-balance sheet transactions during the first nine months of 2024 was 27.9 million, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was 38.6 million. 
 
 To manage our cash position more efficiently, we may enter into securities repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. We generally use securities repurchase agreements as a means to finance the purchase of invested assets or for short-term general business purposes until projected cash flows become available from our operations or existing investments. We had no securities repurchase agreements outstanding at September 30, 2024, nor did we utilize any securities repurchase agreements during the first nine months of 2024. Our use of securities repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements can fluctuate during any given period and will depend on our liquidity position, the availability of long-term investments that meet our purchasing criteria, and our general business needs. 
 
 131 

Certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are members of regional FHLBs. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 25.6 million of FHLB common stock and had outstanding advances of 299.0 million from the regional FHLBs which were used for the purpose of investing in fixed maturity securities. As of September 30, 2024, we have additional borrowing capacity of approximately 642.1 million from the FHLBs. 
 
 See Note 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 1 for further information. 

Consolidated Cash Flows 
 
 (in millions of dollars) Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 1,027.4 859.3 Net Cash Used by Investing Activities (393.1) (498.6) Net Cash Used by Financing Activities (616.9) (314.0) Net Increase in Cash and Bank Deposits 17.4 46.7 
 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 
 Operating cash flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income, offset by payments of claims, commissions, expenses, and income taxes. Premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales, but on policy renewals and growth of existing business, renewal price increases, and persistency. Investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance liabilities and capital and on the earned yield. The level of commissions and operating expenses is attributable to the level of sales and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business as well as the maintenance of existing business. The level of paid claims is affected partially by the growth and aging of the block of business and also by the general economy, as previously discussed in the operating results by segment. 
 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 
 Investing cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments. Investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments. Our investment strategy is to match the cash flows and durations of our assets with the cash flows and durations of our liabilities to meet the funding requirements of our business. When market opportunities arise, we may sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the yield and credit quality of our portfolio. We may at times also sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities and/or re-balance our portfolio. As a result, sales before maturity may vary from period to period. The sale and purchase of short-term investments is influenced by proceeds received from FHLB funding advances, issuance of debt, our securities lending program, and by the amount of cash which is at times held in short-term investments to facilitate the availability of cash to fund the purchase of appropriate long-term investments, repay maturing debt, and/or to fund our capital deployment program. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2023, we sold over 700.0 million of shorter duration bonds in our long-term care portfolio and reinvested the proceeds in higher quality, higher yielding, and longer duration bonds that better match our liability cash flows. As a result of this activity, both sales and purchases of fixed maturity securities were lower in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 See Note 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 1 for further information. 
 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 
 Financing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt, dividends paid to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, and policyholders' account deposits and withdrawals. 
 
 132 

Table of Contents 

 Cash used to repurchase shares of Unum Group's common stock during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 500.0 million and 174.2 million, respectively. In connection with the repurchases made during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we recognized 4.8 million and 1.2 million, respectively, of excise tax which has not been settled as of September 30, 2024. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we paid dividends of 219.3 million and 205.7 million, respectively, to holders of Unum Group's common stock. 
 
 Also included in financing cash flows during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 26.7 million and 18.6 million, respectively, of cash received related to the active life cohort volatility agreement with Commonwealth as a result of the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction. 
 
 In June 2024, we issued 400.0 million of 6.000 senior notes due 2054 and received proceeds of 391.6 million. A portion of the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility, resulting in a cash outflow of 350.0 million. 

Ratings 
 
 AM Best, Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), and Standard Poor's Rating Services (S P) are among the third parties that assign issuer credit ratings to Unum Group and financial strength ratings to our insurance subsidiaries. Issuer credit ratings reflect an agency's opinion of the overall financial capacity of a company to meet its senior debt obligations. Financial strength ratings are specific to each individual insurance subsidiary and reflect each rating agency's view of the overall financial strength (capital levels, earnings, growth, investments, business mix, operating performance, and market position) of the insuring entity and its ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Both the issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings incorporate quantitative and qualitative analyses by rating agencies and are routinely reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. 
 
 We compete based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies. A downgrade of our financial strength ratings can be expected to adversely affect us and could potentially, among other things, adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force, negatively impact persistency and new sales, particularly large case group sales and individual sales, and generally adversely affect our ability to compete. A downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to Unum Group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital or our ability to raise additional capital. 
 
 The table below reflects the outlook as well as the senior unsecured debt ratings for Unum Group and the financial strength ratings for each of our traditional insurance subsidiaries as of the date of this filing.

Table of Contents 

 communications involves our annual review meeting with each of the four agencies. We hold other meetings throughout the year regarding our business, including, but not limited to, quarterly updates. 
 
 In May 2024, Moody's upgraded its senior unsecured debt ratings to Baa2 from Baa3 and also upgraded its financial strength ratings of our rated domestic insurance subsidiaries to A2 from A3. The ratings upgrade reflects strong capital levels, a reduction in asset risk, increasing profitability in the core business, and an improved long-term care position. 
 
 In September 2024, Fitch revised its outlook to positive from stable. The revision reflects strong capital and liquidity positions, sustained levels of improved profitability, and actions taken to mitigate risk in long-term care. 
 
 There have been no other changes in the rating agencies' outlooks or ratings during 2024 prior to the date of this filing. 
 
 Agency ratings are not directed toward the holders of our securities and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be regarded as an independent assessment, not conditional on any other rating. Given the dynamic nature of the ratings process, changes by these or other rating agencies may or may not occur in the near-term. We have ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies concerning our insurance risk profile, our financial flexibility, our operating performance, and the quality of our investment portfolios. The rating agencies provide specific criteria and, depending on our performance relative to the criteria, will determine future negative or positive rating agency actions. 
 
 See our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further information regarding our debt, issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings and the risks associated with rating changes. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. With respect to our exposure to market risk, see the discussion under "Investments" in Item 2 of this Form 10-Q and in Part II, Item 7A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, there was no substantive change to our market risk or the management of this risk. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report. We evaluated those controls based on the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, these officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 (2) In October 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500.0 million of Unum Group's outstanding common stock beginning January 1, 2024. In July 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000.0 million of Unum Group's outstanding common stock beginning on August 1, 2024. The repurchase program authorized in July 2024 replaced the October 2023 authorization and has no scheduled termination date. On July 31, 2024, the remaining unused authorized repurchase amount under the October 2023 authorization expired. 
 
 (3) In July 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement. As part of this transaction, we paid 150.0 million to a financial counterparty, which resulted in an immediate, corresponding reduction to the remaining authorized repurchase amount, and received an initial delivery of 2,197,265 shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 75 percent of the total delivery under the agreement. The final price adjustment settlement, along with the delivery of the remaining shares, occurred in September 2024, resulting in the delivery of 597,276 additional shares. In total, we repurchased 2,794,541 shares pursuant to the July 2024 accelerated share repurchase agreement. The remaining shares repurchased during the third quarter of 2024 were purchased in open market transactions. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Securities trading plans 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement. 
 
 P-Caps Trust 
 
 On November 17, 2021, the Company raised 400.0 million of contingent liquidity through the issuance and sale by Hill City Funding Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (the P-Caps Trust), of 400,000 of pre-capitalized trust securities redeemable August 15, 2041 (the P-Caps) for an aggregate purchase price of 400.0 million in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with the issuance and sale of the P-Caps, the Company entered into a facility agreement with the P-Caps Trust and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as notes trustee, pursuant to which the Company had the right to issue to the P-Caps Trust, and to require the P-Caps Trust to purchase from the Company, on one or more occasions, up to an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of 400.0 million of the Company s 
 135
