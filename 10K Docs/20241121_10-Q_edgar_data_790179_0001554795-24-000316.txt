FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC encourages reporting companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand future prospects and make
informed investment decisions. This report contains these types of statements. Words such as may, expect, 
 believe, intend, anticipate, estimate, project, or continue 
or comparable terminology used in connection with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking
statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
All forward-looking statements reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to a number of important factors and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Overview 

We have not recorded revenues from operations since
our reactivation in 2006. The Company intends to rely upon advances or loans from management, significant stockholders or third parties
to meet our cash requirements, but we have not entered into written agreements guaranteeing funds and, therefore, no one is obligated
to provide funds to us in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plan
is to combine with an operating company to generate revenue. 

Management intends to investigate a potential merger
or acquisition of a company. However, we have not entered into any definitive agreement relating to a transaction as of the filing date
of this report. We anticipate that the evaluation of this opportunity will be complex. We expect that our due diligence will encompass
meetings with its business management and inspection of its operations, as well as review of financial and other information that may
be available to our management. This review may be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third-party consultants that
the Company may engage. The Company s limited funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct
an exhaustive investigation. 

We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity
will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries
and shortages of available capital, we believe that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded
corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving
the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business,
creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring
acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of securities. Potentially available business combinations may occur in
many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis
of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. 

If we obtain a business opportunity, then it may be
necessary to raise additional capital. We anticipate that we will sell our Common Stock to raise this additional capital. We expect that
we would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The purchasers
and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933. We do not currently intend to make a public offering of our stock. We also note that if we issue more shares
of our Common Stock, then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their Common Stock. 

9 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have not recorded revenues from operations since
our reactivation in 2006, and we have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. We have relied
upon loans and advances from related parties to fund our operations. 

At September 30, 2024, we had cash of 2,824 compared
to cash of 17,173 at December 31, 2023. Our total liabilities increased to 365,409 at September 30, 2024, from 346,377 at December
31, 2023, due to increases in accounts payable related party, notes payable related party and accrued interest on notes
payable related party. 

We intend to obtain capital from management, significant
stockholders and third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available.
Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity
and acquire or enter into a merger with such company. The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our
profitability for the long term. 

During the next 12 months, we anticipate incurring
additional costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through advances and loans
provided by management, significant stockholders or third parties, although we do not have any commitments to secure any such loans. We
may also rely on the issuance of our Common Stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for expenses. 

Results of Operations 

We did not record revenues from operations in either
2024 or 2023. General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 18,849 compared to 11,500 the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,848 compared
to 2,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Total other expense increased to 14,532 for the September
30, 2024 Nine-Month Period compared to 12,999 for the September 30, 2023 Nine-Month Period. Total other expense increased to 4,844 for
the September 30 ,2024 Third Quarter compared to 4,451 for the September 30, 2023 Third Quarter. Total other expense represents interest
expense related to notes payable and notes payable - related party. 

Our net loss increased to 33,381 for the September
30, 2024 Nine-Month Period compared to 24,499 for the September 30, 2023 Nine-Month Period. Our net loss increased to 9,692 for the
September 30, 2024 Third Quarter compared to 7,351 for the September 30, 2023 Third Quarter. Management expects net losses to continue
until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity. 

Commitments and Obligations 

At September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed 0 from
a shareholder resulting in notes payable related party of 242,215. These loans are due on demand and bear interest at the rate
of 8 . Interest expense on the loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 14,532, resulting in accrued interest of 112,694
at September 30, 2024. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
a shareholder invoiced the Company for consulting, administrative and professional services and out-of-pocket costs provided or paid
on behalf of the Company totaling 4,500, resulting in accounts payable related party of 10,500 at September 30, 2024. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements	 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term
is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). A company qualifies as an emerging growth company
if it has total annual gross revenues of less than 1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year and, as of December 8,
2011, had not sold common equity securities under a registration statement. Under the JOBS Act we are permitted to, and intend to, rely
on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides
that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits
of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such
new or revised accounting standards.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms
of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President,
who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure
the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate this deficiency
until we acquire or merge with another company. 

Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted
an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that there were no changes made in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal control over financial reporting.
