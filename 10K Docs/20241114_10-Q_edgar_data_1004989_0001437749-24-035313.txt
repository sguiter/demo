 2023 and 2022 Executive Deferred Compensation Agreements 
 
 The Corporation prepared a 2022 Stock Compensation Plan that would have included Awards for NQSOs and RSUs (as defined below), but that plan was never submitted to its shareholders for approval. However, the Board had previously approved, for certain key executives, incentive stock-based awards for 2023 and 2022 using RSUs or cash. Since there were no plan based RSUs available, those executives instead received deferred compensation in the form of Phantom Stock Units ("PSUs"), which correspond to an equal number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock ("SGRP Shares"). The number of PSUs received equals the dollar value of the incentive award divided by the per share market price of SGRP shares on the date of award. Each PSU represents the right of the grantee to receive cash payments based on the fair market value of SGRP Shares at the time of vesting, but not to receive SGRP Shares themselves. The number of the Grantee's PSUs will be automatically adjusted to reflect the specified events respecting the SGRP Shares as provided in the applicable Phantom Stock Agreement. The PSUs do not possess the rights of common stockholders of the Corporation, including any voting or dividend rights, and cannot be exercised or traded for SGRP Shares. 
 
 Effective as of March 24, 2022 the "2022 Grant Date"), the Corporation issued an award of PSUs to each of its Executives: Kori G. Belzer; William Linnane; and Ron Lutz.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had determined that the 2022 performance target had not been met and the first tranche of those PSUs did not vest. The Board approved in October 2023 that the second and third tranches of those PSUs will respectively vest on the second and third anniversary of the 2022 Grant Date with no additional vesting criteria. 

Effective as of April 3, 2023 the "2023 Grant Date"), the Corporation granted an award of PSUs to each of its Executives: Kori G. Belzer; William Linnane; and Ron Lutz. The PSUs granted and issued to each such grantee shall vest over the three -year period following the Grant Date provided that the Grantee is an employee of the Company on the applicable vesting date; and the first tranche of those PSUs was to have vested upon the achievement by the Company of 70 or greater of the budgeted 2023 Global EBIT. If the first -year metrics are achieved, the second and third tranches will respectively vest on the second and third anniversary of the 2023 Grant Date with no additional vesting criteria. As of March 31, 2024, the Company determined that the 2023 performance target had been met, the first tranche of those PSUs had vested, and the second and third tranches of those PSUs will respectively vest on the second and third anniversary of the 2023 Grant Date with no additional vesting criteria. 
 
 Effective as of the 2023 Grant Date, the Corporation also granted an award of PSUs to Michael R. Matacunas, the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Corporation. All of the PSUs granted and issued to him will vest over a one -year period following the 2023 Grant Date provided that the Grantee is an employee of the Company on April 3, 2024, upon the achievement by the Company of 70 or greater of the budgeted 2023 Global EBIT.

Words such as "may," "will," "expect," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "anticipate," "continue," "plan," "project," or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements.

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of our operating performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). "Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as net income before (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense, net, (iii) income tax expense, (iv) Board of Directors incremental compensation expense, (v) restructuring, (vi) goodwill impairment, (vii) nonrecurring legal settlement costs and associated legal expenses unrelated to the Company's core operations, and (viii) special items as determined by management. This metric is a supplemental measure of our operating performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. 
 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in future periods, and any such modification may be material. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries. 
 
 Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance compared to other measures, which can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. We also use Adjusted to supplement U.S. GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies and to make budgeting decisions.

Table of Contents 

Adjusted EBITDA has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations include: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditure or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in our cash requirements for our working capital needs; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense and the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for replacement of assets that are being depreciated and amortized; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect non-cash compensation, which is a key element of our overall long-term compensation; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges or cash receipts resulting from matters we do not find indicative of our ongoing operations; and 

Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.

Net Revenues 
 
 Net revenues for nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 163.8 million, compared to 197.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 33.8 million, or 17.1 . The decline in consolidated revenues is driven by the exit of Australia and the US NMS JV as of the end of 2023 and having exited South Africa, Brazil, India, Japan, and China at various points during the first three quarters of 2024 (for which revenues are included within the 2023). 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Americas net revenue was 144.2 million and 154.5 million, respectively, a decrease of 10.3 million, or 6.7 reflecting strong growth in revenues in our US and Canadian operations, partially offset by lower revenues caused by the sale of Brazil in 2024. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, APAC net revenue was 11.3 million and 17.4 million, respectively, a decrease of 6.1 million, or 35.1 . 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, EMEA net revenue was 8.3 million and 25.8 million, respectively, a decrease of 17.5 million, or 67.8 . The decline in EMEA net revenues compared to 2023 reflects the sale of the joint venture as of March 31, 2024. 
 
 Cost of Revenues 
 
 The Company's cost of revenues consists of its in-store labor and field management wages, related benefits, travel and other direct labor-related expenses and was 80.5 of net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 79.5 of net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross margin is mainly due to the revenue mix in the US (see hereunder in Americas); and (ii) a material decrease in margin in South Africa (see hereunder in EMEA) during the first quarter when SPAR owned that business. 
 
 Cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 131.8 million, compared to 157.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 25.2 million, or 16.1 .

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, APAC cost of revenues were 9.1 million and 12.9 million, respectively, a decrease of 3.8 million, or 29.5 . The APAC cost of revenue as a percent of net revenue was 80.5 and 74.1 for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cost of revenue at APAC was driven primarily by the exit of China and Australia. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, EMEA cost of revenues were 7.0 million and 20.2 million, respectively a decrease of 13.2 million, or 65.3 . The EMEA cost of revenue as a percent of net revenue was 0.0 and 78.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in EMEA cost of revenues compared to 2023 reflects the sale of the South African joint venture as of March 31, 2024. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses of the Company include its corporate overhead, project management, information technology, executive compensation, human resources, legal and accounting expenses.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements and related notes thereto. However, we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates. 
 
 The significant accounting policies and estimates used in preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are described in our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and the notes thereto, which are included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024. Except as detailed in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Funding Requirements 
 
 Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to risks detailed in the section titled "Risk Factors" included elsewhere in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company believes that based upon the continuation of the Company's existing credit facilities, projected results of operations, vendor payment requirements and other financing available to the Company (including amounts due to affiliates), sources of cash availability should be manageable and sufficient to support ongoing working capital and capital expenditure requirements over the next 12 months. However, delays in collection of receivables due from any of the Company's major clients, a significant reduction in business from such clients, or a negative economic downturn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash resources, and ongoing ability to fund operations.

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as our principal financial and accounting officer, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not detect or prevent misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management utilized the criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
