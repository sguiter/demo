 to , based on the Company s credit assessment of individual customers, as well as industry expectations. Product returns are not significant as the bulk of our sales are custom in nature. From time to time, the Company may offer incentives to its customers considered to be variable consideration including volume-based rebates or early payment discounts. Customer incentives considered to be variable consideration are recorded as a reduction to revenue as part of the transaction price at contract inception when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the incentive and only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur. Customer incentives are allocated entirely to the single performance obligation of transferring printed product to the customer and are not considered material. For customers with terms of FOB shipping point, the Company accounts for shipping and handling activities performed after the control of the printed product has been transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost. The Company accrues for the costs of shipping and handling activities if revenue is recognized before contractually agreed shipping and handling activities occur. The Company s contracts with customers are generally short-term in nature. Accordingly, the Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations nor the timing of revenue recognition.

 and of its inventories valued at the lower of last-in first-out (" LIFO ") for the periods ended August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively, the Company values its inventories at the lower of first-in, first-out (" FIFO ") cost or net realizable value. The Company regularly reviews inventories on hand, using specific aging categories, and writes down the carrying value of its inventories for excess and potentially obsolete inventories based on historical usage and estimated future usage. In assessing the ultimate realization of its inventories, the Company is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements. As actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by the Company, adjustments to inventories may be required. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory at August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024 were million and million, respectively.

Management utilizes valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability being measured in determining these fair values.

Where amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is greater than the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized.

Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. The Company had material variable lease costs for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at the inception of the contract. A contract will be deemed to be or contain a lease if the contract conveys the right to control and directs the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company generally must also have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the property, plant, and equipment. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. To determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid, the Company estimates incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at lease commencement date, as rates are not implicitly stated in most leases.

The Company made a million contribution during the period ended August 31, 2024 and a million contribution to the Pension Plan during the fiscal year 2024 . As our Pension Plan assets are invested in marketable securities, fluctuations in market values could potentially impact our funding status, associated liabilities recorded and future required minimum contributions.

This at-risk amount is subject to fluctuation on a daily basis. While management does not believe there is significant risk with respect to such deposits, no assurance can be made that the Company will not experience losses on the Company s deposits. The Company believes its credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to industry and geographic diversification. As disclosed on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, the Company maintains an allowance for credit losses to cover the Company s estimate of credit losses associated with accounts receivable. The Company, for quality and pricing reasons, purchases its paper products from a limited number of suppliers. While other sources may be available to the Company to purchase these products, they may not be available at the cost or at the quality the Company has come to expect.

 Overview 
 Ennis, Inc. (formerly Ennis Business Forms, Inc.) (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company, Registrant, Ennis, or we, us, or our was organized under the laws of Texas in 1909. We and our subsidiaries print and manufacture a broad line of business forms and other business products. We distribute business products and forms throughout the United States primarily through independent distributors. This distributor channel encompasses independent print distributors, commercial printers, direct mail, fulfillment companies, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies, among others. We also sell products to many of our competitors to satisfy their customers needs. 
 Business Overview 
 Our management believes we are the largest provider of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders to independent distributors in the United States. 
 23 

ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES FORM 10-Q FOR THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2024 

 We are in the business of manufacturing, designing, and selling business forms and other printed business products primarily to distributors located in the United States. As of August 31, 2024, we operate 58 manufacturing plants throughout the United States in 20 strategically located states as one reportable segment. Approximately 94 of the business products we manufacture are custom and semi-custom products, constructed in a wide variety of sizes, colors, number of parts, and quantities on an individual job basis, depending upon the customers specifications. 
 The products we sell include snap sets, continuous forms, laser cut sheets, tags, labels, envelopes, integrated products, jumbo rolls and pressure sensitive products in short, medium and long runs under the following labels: Ennis , Royal Business Forms , Block Graphics , 360 Custom Labels SM , ColorWorx , Enfusion , Uncompromised Check Solutions , VersaSeal , Ad Concepts SM , FormSource Limited SM , Star Award Ribbon Company , Witt Printing , B D Litho , Genforms , PrintGraphics , Calibrated Forms , PrintXcel , Printegra , Forms Manufacturers SM , Mutual Graphics , TRI-C Business Forms SM , Major Business Systems SM , Independent Printing SM , Hoosier Data Forms , Hayes Graphics , Wright Business Graphics SM , Wright 360 SM , Integrated Print Graphics SM , the Flesh Company SM , Impressions Direct SM , AmeriPrint SM ; Stylecraft SM , UMC Print SM ; Eagle Graphics SM , Diamond Graphics SM , Printed Technologies SM , Printed Solutions SM and Partek Solutions SM We also sell the Adams McClure brand (which provides Point of Purchase advertising); the Admore , Folder Express , and Independent Folders brands (which provide presentation folders and document folders); Ennis Tag Label SM (which provides custom printed, high performance labels and custom and stock tags); Allen-Bailey Tag Label SM , Atlas Tag Label , Kay Toledo Tag , and Special Service Partners (SSP) (which provides custom and stock tags and labels); Trade Envelopes , Block Graphics , Wisco , and National Imprint Corporation (which provide custom and imprinted envelopes) and Northstar and General Financial Supply (which provide financial and security documents); InfosealSM and PrintXcel (which provide custom and stock pressure seal documents). School Photo Marketing is a one-stop shop for over 1,400 school portrait photographers and professional photo labs nationwide, providing them with a complete array of products and services that reach over 15 million families and 30,000 schools, primarily in the K-8 market. We sell predominantly through independent distributors, as well as to many of our competitors. Northstar Computer Forms, Inc., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, also sells direct to a small number of customers, generally large banking organizations (where a distributor is not acceptable or available to the end-user). Adams McClure, LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary, also sells direct to a small number of customers, where sales are generally through advertising agencies. 
 The printing industry generally sells its products either predominantly to end users, a market dominated by a few large manufacturers, such as R.R. Donnelley and Taylor Corporation, or, like the Company, through a variety of independent distributors and distributor groups. While it is not possible, because of the lack of adequate public statistical information, to determine the Company s share of the total business products market, management believes the Company is the largest producer of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders in the United States distributing primarily through independent distributors. 
 There are a number of competitors that operate in this segment. We believe our strategic locations and buying power permit us to compete on a favorable basis within the distributor market on factors such as service, quality and price. 
 Our products are sold throughout the United States primarily by independent distributors, including business forms distributors, resellers, direct mail, commercial printers, software companies, and advertising agencies. 
 Raw materials principally consist of a wide variety of weights, widths, colors, sizes, and qualities of paper for business products purchased primarily from one major supplier at favorable prices based on the volume of business. 
 Business products usage in the printing industry is generally not seasonal. General economic conditions and contraction of the traditional business forms industry are the predominant factors in quarterly volume fluctuations. 
 Our Business Challenges 
 Our industry is currently experiencing consolidation of traditional supply channels, product obsolescence, paper supplier capacity adjustments, and increased pricing and potential supply allocations due to demand/supply curve imbalance. Technology advances have made electronic distribution of documents, internet hosting, digital printing and print-on-demand valid, cost-effective alternatives to traditional custom-printed documents and customer communications. Improved equipment has become more accessible to our competitors. We face highly competitive conditions throughout our supply chain in an already over-supplied, price-competitive print industry. The challenges of our business include the following: 
 24 

ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES FORM 10-Q FOR THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2024 

 Transformation of our portfolio of products While traditional business documents are essential in order to conduct business, many are being replaced through the use of cheaper paper grades or imported paper, or devalued with advances in digital technologies, causing steady declines in demand for a portion of our current product line. Transforming our product offerings in order to continue to provide innovative, valuable solutions through lower labor and fixed charges to our customers on a proactive basis will require us to make investments in new and existing technology and to develop key strategic business relationships, such as print-on-demand services and product offerings that assist customers in their transition to digital business environments. In addition, we will continue to look for new market opportunities and niches through acquisitions, such as the addition of our envelope offerings, tag offerings, folder offerings, healthcare wristbands, specialty packaging, direct mail, pressure seal products, secure document solutions, innovative in-mold label offerings and long-run integrated products with high color web printing, which provide us with an opportunity for growth and differentiate us from our competition. The ability to make investments in new and existing technology and/or to acquire new market opportunities through acquisitions is dependent on the Company s liquidity and operational results. 
 Production capacity and price competition within our industry Industry supply of paper products is subject to fluctuation as changing industry conditions influence producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or mills, and/or convert them to different product lines, such as packaging to offset a decline in demand. Paper mill shipments were down across the board through the first half of 2023 as buyers worked through elevated inventories of their products. Producers responded to the sluggish demand conditions with heavy downtime rather than permanent closures keeping prices mostly stable. While our supply of paper in the first and second quarter of 2024 has remained stable, margins remain under pressure due to the resulting weak volumes and competitive pricing, we intend to continue to focus on effectively managing and controlling our product costs through the use of forecasting, production and costing models, as well as working closely with our domestic suppliers to reduce our procurement costs, in order to minimize effects on our operational results. In addition, we will continue to look for ways to reduce and leverage our fixed costs and focus on maintaining our margins. 
 Continued consolidation of our customers Our customers are distributors, many of which are consolidating or are being acquired by competitors. We continue to maintain a majority of the business we have had with our customers historically, but it is possible that these consolidations and acquisitions, which we expect to continue in the future, ultimately will impact our margins and sales. 
 For further information, please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, above and Risk Factors contained within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2024, includes a description of certain critical accounting estimates, including those with respect to the pension plan, impairment assessments on goodwill and other intangible assets, allowance for credit losses and accounts receivable, and allowance for excess and obsolete inventories, which we believe are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. During the quarter ended August 31, 2024, there have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2024. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 1 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance. 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion provides information which we believe is relevant to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes included in this filing. The operating results of the Company for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and the comparative period for 2023 are set forth in the tables below.

Three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to three months ended August 31, 2023 
 Net Sales. Our net sales were 99.0 million for the quarter ended August 31, 2024, compared to 106.8 million for the same quarter in the prior year, a decrease of 7.8 million, or 7.3 . Sales decreased 11.2 million due to weaker volume demand and was partially offset by an approximately 3.5 million increase in revenues generated from our recent acquisitions. Current quarter sales decreased 4.1 million, or 3.9 compared to 103.1 million for the sequential quarter ending May 31, 2024. During the latter part of fiscal 2024, we experienced a weakened demand environment with increased competition on price, resulting in lower sales volume and revenues. Our sales volume continues to be impacted by soft customer demand and competitive pricing. 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Margin. As a result of decreased sales volume, our cost of goods sold decreased 4.4 million, or 6.0 , from 73.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 69.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. Our gross profit was 29.8 million or 30.1 of revenue for the quarter ended August 31, 2024 compared to 33.1 million or 31.0 of revenue for the same quarter in the prior year. Our gross profit margin remained relatively flat compared to the immediately preceding quarter ending May 31, 2024 at 30.0 . We continue to take mitigating actions through our cost management and pricing strategies to maintain our margins and offset continued pressure from soft market conditions and increased competition on price. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense. For the three months ended August 31, 2024, our selling, general, and administrative (" SG A ") expenses were 16.6 million compared to 18.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023, a decrease of 1.8 million, or 9.7 . As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses for the current quarter were 16.7 and 17.2 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. Our SG A expense decreased as a result of operational efficiencies. 
 Loss from disposal of assets. The 39,000 and 52,000 net loss from disposal of assets during the three-month period ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was primarily attributed to the sale of equipment. 
 Income from operations. Primarily due to factors described above, our income from operations for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 13.2 million, or 13.3 of net sales, as compared to 14.7 million, or 13.8 of net sales, for the three months ended August 31, 2023, a decrease of 1.5 million. Income from operations declined on a sequential quarter basis by 0.5 million and was 13.7 million for the quarter ended May 31, 2024. 
 Other income (expense). Other income was 1.0 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 0.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. Our increase in income was primarily from an increase in interest income from the increase in balance and rates received on money market accounts and short-term investments in the current quarter, 1.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 0.9 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. 
 Provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate was 27.5 and 28.6 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in our overall tax rate this period as compared to last period is due to a decrease in our overall expected state tax rate due to changes in state apportionment. 
 Net earnings. Net earnings, due to the factors above, were 10.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to 10.9 million for the comparable quarter in the prior year. Net earnings were impacted by decreased revenues for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. After-tax earnings per diluted share for the three months ended August 31, 2024 were 0.40, compared to 0.42 for the same quarter last year. 
 26 

ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES FORM 10-Q FOR THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2024 

 Six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to six months ended August 31, 2023 
 Net Sales. Our net sales were 202.1 million for the six-month period ended August 31, 2024, compared to 218.1 million for the same period last year, a decrease of 15.9 million, or 7.3 . Our recent acquisitions added approximately 7.1 million in revenues for the six-month period ended August 31, 2024 compared to the six-month period ended August 31, 2023. These increases were offset by a 23.0 million reduction in revenue from our legacy business due to volume decline as larger macroeconomic conditions have softened demand and caused greater competition on price. 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Margin. Our cost of goods sold decreased 9.5 million, or 6.3 , from 150.9 million for the six months ended August 31, 2023 to 141.5 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024. Our gross profit was 60.7 million for the six-month period ended August 31, 2024 compared to 67.1 million for the same period in the prior year. Our gross profit margin of 30.0 for the current six-month period, decreasing from the prior year six-month period of 30.8 , is within our target range. Our gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was higher in the prior year six-month period ending August 31, 2023 due to a higher absorption of fixed costs driven from greater volumes shipped. We continue to take mitigating actions through our cost management and pricing strategies to maintain our margins and offset continued pressure from soft market conditions and increased competition on price. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense. For the six months ended August 31, 2024, our SG A expenses were 33.7 million compared to 36.7 million for the six months ended August 31, 2023, a decrease of 2.9 million, or 8.1 . As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses for the period were 16.7 and 16.8 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our SG A expense decreased as a result of operational efficiencies. 
 Loss from disposal of assets. The 43,000 and 52,000 net loss from disposal of assets during the six-month period ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively were primarily attributed to the sale of equipment. 
 Income from operations. Primarily due to factors described above, our income from operations for the six months ended August 31, 2024 was 26.9 million, or 13.3 of net sales, as compared to 30.4 million, or 13.9 of net sales, for the six months ended August 31, 2023. 
 Other income (expense). Other income was 2.0 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 1.0 million for the six months ended August 31, 2023. Our increase in income was primarily from an increase in interest income from increase in balance and rates received on money market accounts and short-term investments in the current period, 2.7 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 1.7 million for the six months ended August 31, 2023. 
 Provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate was 27.5 and 28.3 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in our overall tax rate this period as compared to last period is due to a decrease in our overall expected state tax rate due to changes in state apportionment. 
 Net earnings. Net earnings, due to the factors above, were 21.0 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to 22.5 million for the comparable period in the prior year, a decrease of 1.6 million. Net earnings per diluted share for the six months ended August 31, 2024 was 0.80, compared to 0.87 for the same period in the prior year. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We rely on our cash flows generated from operations to meet all cash requirements of our business. The primary cash requirements of our business are payments to vendors in the normal course of business, capital expenditures, compensation and benefits for employees and the payment of dividends to our shareholders. We believe that our current cash balance of 100.0 million at August 31, 2024, short-term investments of 22.7 million and anticipated cash flows from operations are expected to be similar to prior periods which should be adequate to cover the next twelve months and beyond of our operating and capital requirements. Our capital requirements are expected to be within our historical levels of between 3.0 million and 6.0 million.

Working Capital. Our working capital increased 10.9 million or 6.5 , from 167.6 million at February 29, 2024 to 178.5 million at August 31, 2024. Our current ratio, calculated by dividing our current assets by our current liabilities, increased from 6.0 to 1.0 at February 29, 2024 to 6.3 to 1.0 at August 31, 2024. Our increase in working capital primarily reflects the increase in cash and short-term investments, 11.7 million and inventory, 1.7 million, offset by the decrease in accounts receivable, 3.5 million.

Cash flows from operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was 35.0 million in the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 35.0 million in the comparative period ended August 31, 2023. A decrease in accounts receivable, net of accounts receivable from acquired business since the prior fiscal year end provided cash of 4.6 million in the current year six-month period, and 7.5 million in the comparable six-month period of the prior year. A decrease in inventories provided cash of 0.3 million in the six-month period ended August 31, 2024 and 2.6 million in the same period of 2023. A decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used cash of 0.1 million in the current year six-month period and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used cash of 6.5 million in the prior year comparable six-month period. The decrease in accounts receivable in the current period was primarily due to decreased sales. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses during the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in purchasing activities and inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor incoming orders and adjust raw material purchases accordingly. 
 Cash flows from investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was 1.8 million in the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 15.6 million in the six months ended August 31, 2023. Capital expenditures primarily of equipment was 3.6 million and 3.7 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. In the six months ended August 31, 2024, 5.7 million was used to acquire businesses compared to 11.9 million in same period last year. During the current period, we purchased approximately 10.1 million of U.S. government treasury bills, which was partially offset by 17.5 million in matured treasury bills and invested in money market funds. No treasury bills matured or were purchased during the six months ended August 31, 2023. 
 Cash flows from financing activities. We used 1.8 million more cash in financing activities during the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in cash used during the six months ended August 31, 2024 resulted from 1.8 million common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase program in the six months ended August 31, 2024. 
 Credit Facility As of August 31, 2024, we had 0.3 million outstanding under a standby letter of credit arrangement secured by a cash collateral bank account. It is anticipated that our cash, short-term investments and funds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund anticipated future expenditures, including acquisitions. 
 Pension Plan The funded status of our Pension Plan is dependent on many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and the level of funding. Assuming a stable funding status, we would expect that future required contributions would be between 1.0 million and 3.0 million per year. As our pension assets are invested in marketable securities, changes in actual investment returns or in discount rates could change funding status and requirements significantly. We made a contribution of 1.2 million to our Pension Plan during the period ended August, 31, 2024 and 2023. At August 31, 2024, we had a funded pension asset of 0.1 million. 
 Inventories We believe our inventory levels are sufficient to satisfy our customer demands and we anticipate having adequate sources of raw materials to meet future business requirements. We have long-term contracts in effect with paper suppliers that govern prices, but do not require minimum purchase commitments. Certain of our rebate programs do, however, require minimum purchase volumes. Management anticipates meeting the required volumes. 
 Capital Expenditures We continue to make capital expenditures for operational maintenance purposes, as may be required. Additionally, we will carefully review and make capital expenditures for additional equipment to the extent such additions make economic sense by improving our operations and not jeopardizing our strong liquidity position. We expect our capital requirements for our current fiscal year, exclusive of capital required for possible acquisitions, will be within our historical levels of between 3.0 million and 6.0 million. For the six months ended August 31, 2024, we spent approximately 3.6 million on capital expenditures that was funded out of our cash balance. We expect to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities to cover our operating and other normal capital requirements for the foreseeable future.

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITA TIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market Risk 
 Interest Rates 
 From time to time, we are exposed to interest rate risk on short-term and long-term financial instruments carrying variable interest rates. We may from time to time utilize interest rate swaps to manage overall borrowing costs and reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. While we had no outstanding debt at August 31, 2024, we will be exposed to interest rate risk if we borrow in the future. 
 
 This market risk discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in domestic and global financial markets. 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our controls and procedures are tested and evaluated at regular intervals to confirm that they are adequate and followed by our personnel to prevent misstatement of the Company s financial statements. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. Those inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people. Our controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the above objectives have been met. Our management, with the participation of our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer CFO ), has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of August 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information relating to us (including our consolidated subsidiaries), which is required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a 15(f) or Rule 15d 15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the six months ended August 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe the disposition of any current matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 
 In October 2023, Crabar/GBF, Inc., a subsidiary of Ennis, was awarded 5.8 million in actual damages, exemplary damages and attorney s fees in a case against Wright Printing Company, its owner Mark Wright, and CEO Mardra Sikora. Given the defendants pending appeal, we have not yet recognized the proceeds from the judgment in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of August 31, 2024. In addition, the defendants have posted cash bonds that total approximately 5.1 million, which should be recoverable by the Company if defendants appeal is unsuccessful. 
 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes in our Risk Factors as previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2024.

 At its July 14, 2022 meeting, the Ennis, Inc. Board of Directors authorized an additional 20 million in funding for the Company s share repurchase program that was first implemented in 2008. With this latest funding authorization, the cumulative funds authorized for share repurchases totals 60 million.

These repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice. 
 
 During the six months ended August 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 91,922 shares of common stock under the program at an average price of 19.79.
