SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Some statements contained in this Annual Report are forward-looking in nature. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intends, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report may include, for example, statements about: 

our ability to complete our initial business combination with a business that reflects our strategy; 

our expectations around the performance of the prospective target business or businesses; 

our ability to remain qualified for continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market despite the likelihood of substantial redemptions of our ordinary shares; 

our potential ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination; 

the ability of the combined company resulting from our initial business combination to qualify for initial listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market despite the substantial redemptions of our ordinary shares in connection with the first extension meeting and the second extension meeting; 

our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

our officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination, as a result of which they would then receive expense reimbursements; 

our pool of prospective target businesses; 

risks associated with acquiring a business that reflects our strategy; 

the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities; 

our public securities potential liquidity and trading; 

the lack of a market for our securities; 

the use of proceeds not held in our U.S.-based trust account at Bank of America, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee trust account or available to us from interest income on our trust account balance; 

our trust account not being subject to claims of third parties; or 

our financial performance following our initial public offering or following our initial business combination. 

Additionally, on January 24, 2024, the SEC (as defined below) adopted the 2024 SPAC Rules, which became effective on July 1, 2024, and will affect our ability to effect a business combination transaction. The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other matters, (i) additional disclosures relating to business combination transactions; (ii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors and their affiliates in both initial public offerings and business combination transactions of special purpose acquisition companies; (iii) additional disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions; and (iv) the requirement that both the of special purpose acquisition company and its target company be co-registrants for registration statements relating to business combination transactions. In addition, the SEC s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a special purpose acquisition company like ourselves could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the special purpose acquisition company and its management team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto. 

The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors . Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

The initial stage of the Company s Public Offering the sale of Units closed on November 2, 2021. Upon that closing million was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account (see also note 1(c) below). Out of the million placed in the trust account, the Company raised a total of million, inclusive of the exercise of the over-allotment option and an additional million were invested by the Company's Sponsor for the benefit of the Public to preserve a redemption value of . The Company intends to finance its initial Business Combination with the net proceeds from the Public Offering and the Private Placement.

Unless and until the Company completes the Initial Business Combination, it may pay its expenses only from the net proceeds of the Public Offering held outside the Trust Account. 

d. 

Initial Business Combination 

The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Public Offering, although substantially all of the net proceeds of the Public Offering are intended to be generally applied toward consummating an initial Business Combination. The initial Business Combination must occur with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on the income accrued in the Trust Account). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully consummate an initial Business Combination. 

The Company, after signing a definitive agreement for an Initial Business Combination, will provide its public shareholders the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination, either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. However, in no event will the Company redeem its public shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than thousand following such redemptions. In such case, the Company would not proceed with the redemption of its public shares and the related initial Business Combination, and instead may search for an alternate initial Business Combination. 

If the Company holds a shareholder vote or there is a tender offer for shares in connection with an initial Business Combination, a public shareholder will have the right to redeem its shares for an amount in cash equal to its pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two days prior to the general meeting or commencement of the Company s tender offer, including interest but less taxes payable. As a result, the Company s Class A ordinary shares are recorded at redemption amount and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Public Offering, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.

Initial Business Combination / Extension Amendment 

Pursuant to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to 100 thousand of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

On November 2, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting (the Second Extension Meeting ), at which the Company s shareholders voted to approve the Second Extension, which extended the Mandatory Liquidation Date from November 2, 2023 to November 2, 2024. 

On April 2, 2024, the Company entered into a non-binding heads of agreement with Tembo e-LV B.V. (Tembo), a private company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, regarding a potential business combination transaction. The Company s Chief Executive Officer is also the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of VivoPower International PLC, which owns 100 of Tembo. 

On August 29, 2024, the Company and Tembo signed a Business Combination 

 Agreement (BCA). Under the BCA, the consideration to be paid to the equity holders of Tembo is million and will be paid entirely in the form of newly issued ordinary shares of new combined company, with each share valued at . The BCA was entered into by the parties following due diligence and receipt by the Company s board of directors of a fairness opinion from an independent third party. 

On November 1, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting (the Third Extension Meeting ), at which the Company s shareholders voted to approve the Third Extension, which extended the mandatory liquidation date from November 2, 2024 to November 2, 2025. See Note 9 Subsequent Events for additional information. 

The Sponsors and the Company s officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Class B ordinary shares (as described in Note 7) held by them if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within 18 months of the closing of the Public Offering or during any extended time that the Company has to consummate 

 an initial Business Combination beyond 18 months as a result of a shareholder vote to amend its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, if the Sponsor or any of the Company s directors or officers acquire any Class A ordinary shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete the Initial Business Combination within the prescribed time period. 

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company after an initial Business Combination, the Company s shareholders are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the ordinary shares. The Company s shareholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the ordinary shares, except that the Company will provide its shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, under the circumstances, and, subject to the limitations, described herein. 

f. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

On November 2, 2024 the Company extended the date by which the Company has to consummate an Initial Business Combination from November 2, 2024 to November 2, 2025 (hereafter the Mandatory Liquidation Date). If a business combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. The Company intends to complete an Initial Business Combination before the Mandatory Liquidation Date. 

However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to consummate any business combination ahead of the Mandatory Liquidation Date, nor that they will be able to raise sufficient funds to complete an Initial Business Combination. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, for the subsequent twelve months following the issuance date of these financial statements. No adjustments have been made to the carrying 

amounts and classification of assets or liabilities should the Company fail to obtain financial support in its search for an Initial Business Combination, nor if it is required to liquidate after the Mandatory Liquidation Date. See also Note 5. 

No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company fail to obtain financial support in its search for an Initial

Emerging Growth Company 

Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. 

This may make a comparison of the Company s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible, because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We completed our initial public offering in November 2021, and since that time, we have engaged in discussions with potential business combination target companies; we have not, however, as of yet, reached a definitive agreement with a specific target company with respect to an initial business combination with us. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. 

The issuance of additional ordinary shares in a business combination (by our company, or by a target company that will serve as the public company following the business combination and in which target company shareholders may possess a majority interest): 

may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in our initial public offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions of the Class B ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares; 

may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares; 

could cause a change of control if a substantial number of our (or the target company s) ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 

may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and 

may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants. 

Similarly, if we or the target company issue(s) debt securities or otherwise incur significant indebtedness, it could result in: 

default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 

acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 

our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is issued and outstanding; 

our inability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares; 

using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and 

limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.

As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, at September 30, 2024, we had 13,000 of cash and a 858,000 working capital deficit (net of Sponsor loan). Further, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. 

Extension of our Combination Period 

Second Extension 

On November 2, 2023, we held an extraordinary general meeting (the Second Extension Meeting ), at which the Company s shareholders voted to approve the Second Extension, which extended the Mandatory Liquidation Date from November 2, 2023 to November 2, 2024. 

Third Extension 

On November 1, 2024, we held an extraordinary general meeting (the Third Extension Meeting ), at which the Company s shareholders voted to approve the Third Extension, which extended the mandatory liquidation date from November 2, 2024 to November 2, 2025. See Recent Developments for additional information. 

Heads of Agreement / Business Combination Agreement 

On April 2, 2024, we entered into a non-binding heads of agreement with Tembo e-LV B.V. (Tembo), a private company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, regarding a potential business combination transaction. Our Chief Executive Officer is also the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of VivoPower International PLC, which owns 100 of Tembo. 

On August 29, 2024, we and Tembo signed a Business Combination Agreement (BCA). Under the BCA, the consideration to be paid to the equity holders of Tembo is 838 million and will be paid entirely in the form of newly issued ordinary shares of new combined company, with each share valued at 10.00. The BCA was entered into by the parties following due diligence and receipt by our board of directors of a fairness opinion from an independent third party. 

If a business combination is not consummated by November 2, 2025, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. The Company intends to complete an Initial Business Combination before the Mandatory Liquidation Date.

Nasdaq Compliance MVPHS Rule 

On May 7, 2024, we received a written notice (the Notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Company was not in compliance with Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) (the MVPHS Rule ), which requires listed securities to maintain a minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (MVPHS) of 15,000,000. Based upon Nasdaq s review of the Company s MVPHS, the Company no longer meets this requirement. Consequently, a deficiency exists with regard to the MVPHS Rule. However, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(D), the Notice states that the Company has 180 calendar days, or until November 4, 2024, in which to regain compliance with the MVPHS Rule.

On April 29, 2024, we entered into a subsequent sponsor securities purchase agreement (the Second Purchase Agreement with the Company s sponsor, EVGI and ARWM Pte Limited (the Second Purchaser or ARWM ), pursuant to which, EVGI has agreed to transfer to the Second Purchaser on the closing under the Second Purchase Agreement (a) an aggregate of 2,360,000 founders shares Founders Shares ), consisting of 2,359,999 Class A ordinary shares, par value 0.0001, of the Company Class A Ordinary Shares ), or 46.50 of the outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares, and 1 Class B ordinary share, par value 0.0001, of the Company Class B Ordinary Share ), or 100 of the outstanding Class B Ordinary Shares and (b) 3,893,334 private placement warrants Private Warrants that had been purchased by the Original Sponsor concurrently with the Company s IPO (collectively, the Second Transferred Securities ). The Second Transferred Securities collectively constituted 93.3 of the securities of the Company owned by the Purchaser prior to the Second Transfer (as defined below). 170,000 Class A Ordinary Shares, or 3.36 of the outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares were transferred where earlier transferred to the Purchaser s Designees (as defined below). The Original Sponsor has retained 632,500 Class A Ordinary Shares, or 12.46 of the outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares, and 973,333 Private Warrants. The transfer of the Second Transferred Securities to the Second Purchaser pursuant to the Second Purchase Agreement is referred to as the Third Transfer. The Second Transfer, all agreements executed in connection with the Second Transfer are referred to as the Third Sponsor Alliance. 

As part of the closing of the Sponsor Alliance on May 16, 2024, the Company introduced a change in management (the Management Change and the board of directors of the Company Board as follows: (i) Stephen T. Wills tendered his resignation as Chief Financial Officer, initially effective upon the closing but subsequently extended to May 31, 2024; and (ii) , Emmanuel Meyer, Joep Thomassen and Huiyan Geng resigned as members of the Board of Directors, effective upon the closing. Also, effective as of the closing on May 16, 2024, Adam John Ridgway, Jeffrey Brian LeBlanc and Terry Allan Farris (collectively, the New Directors were appointed to the Board by the Purchaser, as the holder of the sole outstanding Class B ordinary share.

Third Extension Meeting 

We called an extraordinary general meeting of the Company on November 1, 2024 (the Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting on, among other proposals, a proposal to approve, by way of special resolution, an amendment to Cactus Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Articles to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination (the Extension from November 2, 2024 to November 2, 2025 (the or such earlier date as may be determined by Cactus board of directors in its sole discretion (the Articles Extension Proposal ). 

On November 1, 2024, we held an extraordinary general meeting (the Third Extension Meeting ), at which the Company s shareholders voted to approve the Third Extension, which extended the mandatory liquidation date from November 2, 2024 to November 2, 2025. A total of 1,148,799 Class A ordinary shares were redeemed in connection with the Third Extension, resulting in 3,926,071 Class A ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 763,572 publicly-held Class A ordinary shares and 3,162,499 founders shares. Accordingly, on November 13, 2024, 13,389,826 was distributed from the Trust Account to the shareholders who redeemed their shares. 

On October 29, 2024, we and ARWM Inc Pte. Ltd. (the Company s current Sponsor), entered into a non-redemption agreement (NRA) with an unaffiliated third party (the Non-Redeeming Shareholder ). Pursuant to the NRA, the Non-Redeeming Shareholder agreed not to redeem (or to validly rescind any redemption requests with respect to) an aggregate of 500,000 publicly-held Class A ordinary shares of the Company Non-Redeemed Shares in connection with the shareholder vote on the Articles Extension Proposal. In exchange for the foregoing commitments not to redeem the Non-Redeemed Shares, the Sponsor agreed to transfer an aggregate of 125,000 founder shares of the Company held by it Founder Shares to the Non-Redeeming Shareholder immediately following, and subject to, consummation of an initial business combination. To the extent that a business combination does not close by May 2, 2025, the Sponsor agreed to transfer an additional 25,000 Founder Shares of the Company held by it per month beginning on May 3, 2025 and ending on October 2, 2025. 

Nasdaq Listing Rules Notice of Delisting 

On October 29, 2024, the Company received a notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) stating that because the Company had not completed an initial business combination within 36 months of the effective date of its registration statement in connection with its initial public offering, it was not in compliance with Nasdaq IM 5101-2 and was therefore subject to delisting. The Company had until November 5, 2024 to request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (Panel), but did not request a hearing and intends to trade on the over the counter (OTC) market. 

On November 2, 2024 (see above), the Company secured shareholder approval to extend its life by 12 months, to November 5, 2025. Trading in the Company s securities on NASDAQ was suspended at the opening of business on November 5, 2024 and trading of the Company s securities on the OTC market commenced on November 6, 2024, under the symbol CCTSF. The delisting and commencement of trading on OTC does not affect the Company s previously announced business combination agreement with Tembo, as both parties continue to work to effectuate the completion of the transaction. The combined company intends to apply for up-listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market in connection with the completion of the business combination. 

Results of Operations 

We have not engaged in any revenue-generating operations to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities, preparations for our initial public offering, and, subsequent to our initial public offering, searching for, and due diligence related to, potential target companies with which to consummate a business combination transaction. We have not and we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on funds held in our trust account after our initial public offering. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position since the September 30, 2024 date of our financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report. After our initial public offering, which was consummated in November 2021, we have been incurring increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses related to our search for a target company. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 13,000 in our operating bank account, and a working capital deficit of 858,000 (not including the sponsor loan). 

Our liquidity needs to date have been satisfied through loans primarily from our sponsors, plus third-parties to cover certain operating expenses.

Promissory Notes 

On May 17, 2024, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company s third sponsor, ARWM Inc Pte. Ltd. (the Lender with a principal amount up to 500,000 (the Note ). The Note is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) November 1, 2024, (b) the date of the consummation of the Company s initial business combination or (c) the date of the liquidation of the Company (such earlier date, the Maturity Date ). The Note bears no interest, however, an establishment fee, a line fee and an exit fee totaling in aggregate 9.0 per annum are payable on the Maturity Date. At the option of Lender, at any time on or prior to the Maturity Date, any unpaid principal amount outstanding under this Note may be converted into whole warrants of the Company to purchase common stock of the Company at a conversion price equal to 1.00 per Warrant. If Lender elects such conversion, the terms of such Warrants shall be identical, with the exception of the exercise price, to the warrants issued in connection with Company s initial public offering that closed on November 02, 2021 (the Private Placement Warrants ). 

The Company and the Lender signed a Note extension to extend the Maturity Date from November 2, 2024 to June 30, 2025. All other terms of the Note remain unchanged by the Note extension. 

The Lender has advanced 397,000 as of September 30, 2024 under the Note. If the Company does not consummate an initial business combination by the Maturity Date the Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. 

On March 25, 2024, we issued an unsecured promissory note to Energi Holding Limited (the Lender , not a related party, with a principal amount up to 600,000 (the Note ). The Note is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) November 1, 2024, (b) the date of the consummation of the Company s initial business combination or (c) the date of the liquidation of the Company (such earlier date, the Maturity Date ). The Note bears no interest, however, an establishment fee, a line fee and an exit fee totaling in aggregate 9.0 per annum, are payable on the Maturity Date. 

On March 25, 2024, the Lender advanced 600,000 to the Company under the Note. If the Company does not consummate an initial business combination by the Maturity Date, the Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. 

The Company is in discussions with the Lender to extend the Maturity Date past November 1, 2024. 

We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in our trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on our trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), minus amounts paid out to redeeming shareholders, as consideration to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that our ordinary shares or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in our trust account (less any amounts paid out to redeeming shareholders) will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

Prior to our initial business combination, we are using the proceeds held outside of our trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business combination, pay for administrative and support services, and pay taxes to the extent the interest earned on our trust account is not sufficient to pay our taxes. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses.

Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024, only approximately 13,000 is available to us outside of the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. Because of the anticipated costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination, as noted above, we have requested and are seeking additional loans from several third parties, but to date have not secured any additional funding. While, if obtained, we anticipate that these loans will suffice for the period leading up to our initial business combination, we have not yet obtained, and there can be no assurance that the loans will ever be obtained, and, even if they are, that the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating and consummating an initial business combination may be greater than what we currently estimate would be needed to do so. Consequently, it is likely that we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate our trust account. That required liquidation date would be less than 12 months after the date of this Annual Report. That, among other factors, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Item 1 - Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Search for, and Consummation of or Inability to Consummate, a Business Combination - Because the funds being held outside of the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for the remainder of the combination period , that could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination, as we will depend on additional loans third parties to fund those activities in our 2023 Annual Report. 

Moreover, given the significant percentage of our public shareholders that have elected to redeem their shares in connection with our first extension meeting, our second extension meeting and our article amendment meeting, and our third extension meeting, and may elect to redeem at a meeting to approve a business combination, thereby reducing our cash resources, we likely will need to secure third party financing in order to successfully effect such a business combination and there can be no assurance that it will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only raise financing by issuing additional securities simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. We cannot assure you that our plans for that financing or to consummate an initial business combination will be successful. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations; Quarterly Results 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as described in Item 303 of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments for capital expenditures or contractual obligations. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

None.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The net proceeds from our initial public offering and the sale of the private warrants held in the trust account, after reduction for payments made for the redemption of a portion of the public shares in connection with the first extension meeting, conversion amendment meeting and second extension meeting, are invested in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ), which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, whom we refer to as our certifying officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our certifying officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
