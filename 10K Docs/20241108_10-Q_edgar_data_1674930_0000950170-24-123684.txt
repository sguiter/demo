million as of December 31, 2023, represents the fair value of the million shares of preferred stock of a privately-held, Cayman Islands company, Laboratory for Advanced Medicine, Inc., or LAMH, doing business as Helio Health that the Company purchased in July 2021. Helio Health is an AI-biotechnology company developing blood-based early cancer detection tests, and the Company expected to gain access to an emerging liquid biopsy testing technology, through this strategic partnership. As the preferred stock had the option to be redeemed, the investment was initially recorded as available-for-sale debt securities with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). On June 19, 2024, the Board of Directors of LAMH approved to spin out certain United States-based laboratory and development operations into a separate, privately-held Delaware corporation, Helio Genomics, Inc., or Helio Genomics. The Company received million shares of preferred stock of Helio Genomics in connection with this spin-out. Post spin-out, Helio Genomics amended and restated its certificate of incorporation on July 25, 2024, which resulted in a change in stockholder s rights where the Company no longer holds the right to redeem its preferred stock of Helio Genomics. As a result, the Company reclassified million unrealized gain out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net income (loss) in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company elected to record its preferred stock investment in Helio Genomics under the measurement alternative in accordance with ASC 321, defined as cost less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. As of July 25, 2024, the preferred stock investment carrying value of million was recorded as other long-term assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. impairment loss was recorded as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

For the therapeutic development business, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there is no concentration risk in customers, as it does not have any commercialized or approved product candidates. The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain laborat ory substances used in the chemical reactions incorporated into its processes, referred to as reagents, as well as for the sequencers and various other equipment and materials it uses in its laboratory operations. In particular, the Company relies on a sole supplier for the next generation sequencers and associated reagents it uses to perform its genetic tests and as the sole provider of maintenance and repair services for these sequencers. The operations of the laboratory services business would be interrupted if it encountered delays or difficulties securing these reagents, sequencers, other equipment or materials or maintenance and repair services, which could occur for a variety of reasons, including if the Company needs a replacement or temporary substitute for any of its limited or sole suppliers and is not able to locate and make arrangements with an acceptable replacement or temporary substitute. The Company's development efforts could also be delayed or interrupted if it is unable to procure items needed for its therapeutic development activities. The Company s therapeutic development business also relies on ANP Technologies, Inc., or ANP, for certain laboratory services, equipment, tools, and drug intermediates in connection with research and development efforts. The Company believes there are currently only a few other manufacturers that are capable of supplying and servicing some of the equipment and other materials necessary for its laboratory operations, including collection kits, sequencers and various associated reagents.

reportable segment prior to December 2023. Given the advancement of the therapeutic development business, the Company made certain changes, including the bifurcation of financial information for the Company s budget and forecast planning process in December 2023. The CODM manages the operations of the Company and reviews discrete financial information to make resource decisions for its operating segments separately. These are laboratory services and therapeutic development. The laboratory services operating segment offers technical laboratory services and professional interpretation of laboratory results by licensed physicians who specialize in pathology and oncology. The therapeutic development operating segment is a pharmaceutical research and development entity that the Company acquired in November 2022. These operating segments do not meet the aggregation criteria and therefore represent the Company s reportable segments. There is no inter-segment allocation of interest expense and income taxes. There is no inter-segment revenue and operating income or loss.

million of notes payable related to an installment sale contract the Company entered in February 2022 for a building. . The current portion and noncurrent portion are million and million , respectively, and the noncurrent portion is included in the other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The related interest expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not significant. Purchase Obligations From time to time, the Company enters into certain purchase commitments with its vendors, consisting primarily of services, reagent and supplies, computer software, and medical lab equipment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had purchase obligations of million , of which, million is payable within 12 months, and the remainder, million , is payable within the next 5 years.

million of reimbursements from HRSA under the Uninsured Program during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. There is uncertainty with respect to the methodology HRSA will use in its audit and whether and how HRSA will extrapolate audit results. The Company is working with HRSA s auditors to resolve any issues related to its audit, including any reimbursed amounts that may need to be returned to HRSA. The Company has also received a CID issued by the DOJ pursuant to the False Claims Act related to the DOJ s investigation that the Company submitted or caused to be submitted false claims to the Uninsured Program. The Company is fully cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CIDs that it has received. The Company cannot currently predict when these CID and HRSA audit matters will be resolved, the reasonable or likely outcome of these matters, or their potential impact, which may materially and adversely affect the Company s business, prospects, and financial condition. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss, if any, that may result from any material government investigations, audits, and reviews in which it is currently involved, given the inherent difficulty in predicting regulatory action, fines and penalties, if any, and the various remedies and levels of judicial review available to the Company in the event of an adverse finding. As a result, the Company has not recorded any liability related to these CID or audit matters. In addition, and as previously disclosed, the SEC is conducting a non-public formal investigation, which relates to (i) the matters raised in the requests for the CID regarding allegations of medically unnecessary laboratory testing, improper billing for laboratory testing, and remuneration received or provided in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law and (ii) the Company s Exchange Act reports filed for 2018 through 2020. On May 6, 2024, the SEC staff advised the Company that the SEC staff made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against the Company based on a corporate negligence theory, which, if authorized, would allege violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder. The Company and the SEC staff have been in communication regarding these matters, and the Company has fully cooperated with the SEC in its requests. While the Company does not believe that any enforcement recommendation is warranted and denies all liability, the Company has recorded a million potential liability with respect to this matter. While the Company believes this amount is a reasonable estimate, the actual amount of liability, when and if, ultimately determined may be materially higher than this estimate. In relation to a recent advisory opinion issued by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or the OIG, the Company s subsidiary, Symphony Buyer, Inc., or Inform Diagnostics, initiated a voluntary disclosure process with the appropriate government contact. The Company had previously estimated and recorded million as a liability in its financial statements in connection with this voluntary disclosure. However, the Company has now reached a settlement in principle with the OIG for approximately million and has now recorded million for this liability in its condensed consolidated financial statements. This settlement in principle is subject to execution of a definitive settlement agreement. While this million amount has been deemed reasonable by the Company's management, it could change as and if the definitive settlement agreement is finalized. 

 primarily for laboratory and office space and equipment. The Company has options to renew some of these leases after their expirations. On a lease-by-lease basis, the Company considers such options, which may be elected at the Company s sole discretion, in determining the lease term. The Company also has various finance leases for lab equipment with varying terms through , some of which were acquired in business combinations. The Company does not have any leases with variable lease payments. The Company s operating lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees, material restrictive covenants, bargain purchase options, or asset retirement obligations.

million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company s effective tax rates were and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate compared to prior periods is due to the valuation allowance in the current period that precludes the Company from recognizing the full benefit from net operating losses. The Company is under examination by certain tax authorities for the 2020 to 2021 tax years. While the timing of the conclusion of the examination is uncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts have been reserved for adjustments that may result. During 2024, the statutes of limitations will lapse on the Company s 2020 federal tax year and certain 2019 and 2020 state tax years. The Company does not believe the federal or state statute lapses or any other event will significantly impact the balance of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. The Company received million and million in income tax refunds in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and and million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The income tax refunds received, which were due to overpayment in prior years, were not netted in the income tax paid amounts included in the supplemental disclosure in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company purchased million worth of Investment Tax Credits, or ITCs, under the transferability provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for million in cash. The million difference between the purchase price and the face value of the credits has been recorded as an increase to the Company s income tax benefit for the period. The million cash payment was included in the income tax paid amounts included in the supplemental disclosure in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company has utilized million of the acquired credits on its 2023 tax return and carried back the remainder of million to its 2020 tax year and filed a request for a refund. The full amount of million is reflected as an increase in the Company s prepaid income taxes in the other current assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024.

The Company has identified its laboratory services business and its therapeutic development business as its operating segments, and the Company determined that the two operating segments represented the reporting units. The Company tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level on December 31st of each year and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Laboratory Services The Company recognized a full goodwill impairment loss for the goodwill of its laboratory services reporting unit as of December 31, 2023 due to a continued decline in its share price and market capitalization. Therapeutic Development Based upon the results of the quantitative assessments the Company performed as of December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that the fair values of the therapeutic development reporting unit and the IPR D asset at December 31, 2023, were greater than the carrying values and that there was no impairment. There have been no significant changes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions management made for the purposes of the goodwill or IPR D impairment analysis will prove to be accurate predictions of future performance. It is possible that the conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets could change in future periods. Management will continue to monitor the therapeutic development reporting unit. For all IPR D projects, there are major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization of these product candidates, including the ability to confirm their efficacy based on data from clinical trials, the ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, and the ability to successfully complete these tasks within budgeted costs. The Company is not able to market a human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. In addition, the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans, impact the revenues a product can generate. Consequently, the eventual realized value, if any, of these acquired IPR D projects may vary from their estimated fair values.

Revenue decreased by 12.9 million, or (15) , from 84.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 71.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in revenue was due to decreases of 18.9 million in COVID-19 testing services, 0.6 million in BioPharma services, and 0.3 million in anatomic pathology, partially offset by an increase of 6.9 million in precision diagnostics. 
 Revenue decreased by 11.5 million, or (5) , from 218.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 207.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in revenue was due to decreases of 21.0 million in COVID-19 testing services, 10.5 million in BioPharma services, 7.6 million in anatomic pathology, and partially offset by an increase of 27.6 million in precision diagnostics. 
 The increase in precision diagnostics revenue was due to a growth in our reproductive health services and growth in our specialized oncology tests and testing services. The decrease in anatomic pathology services was due to decreased reimbursement rates from third-party payors. We have also experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonality in our anatomic pathology testing services which are dependent on patients being treated by healthcare providers. The volume of our anatomic pathology testing services can fluctuate during holiday periods and can decline due to extreme adverse weather conditions. The decrease in BioPharma 
 27 

services was attributed to timing of BioPharma service projects. We also expect that our BioPharma services revenue may continue to fluctuate from period to period due in part to the length of the sales cycle and variation in timing amongst projects. The decrease in COVID-19 testing services was primarily due to revenue recorded for testing services completed in the prior periods and ceased testing operations at the end of March 2023. 
 We believe the factors that will affect our ability to grow or maintain these revenue streams are 1) the average price point we offer and the reimbursement rate from third-party payors; 2) the concentration of our payor base; 3) the competitive advantage we have due to our broad and flexible test menu, detection rate, and turnaround times; and 4) growth in size of an addressable market. Estimated collection amounts from third-party payors are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as considerations unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Our customer base includes insurance, institutional, and individual payors. In some periods, our revenue is concentrated on a smaller number of customers. For the laboratory services business, aggregating customers that are under common control, one customer comprised of 16.2 million, or 23 , of total revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and contributed 45.7 million, or 22 , of total revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The same customer contributed 12.2 million, or 14 , of total revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2023, and contributed 24.8 million, or 11 , of the Company s total revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. To reduce this revenue concentration risk, we continue to focus on increasing the number of customers and thereby reducing the concentration. 
 Revenue from non-U.S. sources increased by 0.3 million, or 6 , from 5.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue from non-U.S. sources increased by 3.6 million, or 25 , from 14.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 18.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in revenue from non-U.S. sources between periods were primarily due to new foreign customers and increased sales of our testing services to some of our existing non-U.S. customers.

Our consolidated cost of revenue was flat in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Our consolidated cost of revenue decreased by 7.6 million, or 5 , from 139.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 131.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in consolidated cost of revenue was due to decreases of 5.6 million in consulting and outside labor costs, 1.7 million in software expenses, 1.0 million in shipping and handling expenses, related to the cessation of COVID-19 testing operations, closure of a laboratory, and efforts of optimizing cost structures mentioned above, partially offset by an increase of 0.9 million in reagents and supply expenses. 
 Our consolidated cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased from 53 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 63 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to revenue recorded in 2023 for COVID-19 testing services completed in the prior periods due to collection efforts. Our consolidated cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue was flat in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Our gross profit decreased by 13.1 million, or 33 , from 39.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 26.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased by 3.9 million, or 5 , from 79.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 75.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, decreased from 47 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 37 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and was flat in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The decreases were primarily due to revenue recorded in 2023 for COVID-19 testing services completed in the prior periods due to collection efforts.

Research and development expenses for the laboratory services business were mainly for developing our technology and testing services and were flat for both periods. 
 Research and development expenses for the therapeutic development business were primarily related to the development of FID-007. The expenses increased by 2.2 million, or 87 , from 2.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased by 7.3 million, or 95 , from 7.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 15.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to the drug study with our contract research organizations. We anticipate research and development expenditures for this segment to continue to increase as we began enrollment for the phase 2 study of FID-007 in the second quarter of 2024. We expect to enroll approximately 40 patients at various sites for this clinical trial and to complete enrollment by late 2025. We anticipate research and development expenditures to continue to increase as and if the pace of our enrollment for the phase 2 study for FID-007 increases and as we continue the development of FID-007 and other potential therapeutic candidates. 
 Selling and Marketing 
 Our consolidated selling and marketing expenses decreased by 1.0 million, or 10 , from 10.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 9.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in consolidated selling and marketing expenses was due to decreases of 0.6 million in marketing expenses and 0.5 million in facility expense. 
 Our consolidated selling and marketing expenses decreased by 4.3 million, or 14 , from 31.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 26.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in consolidated selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to decreases of 1.3 million in facility expenses, 1.2 million in consulting and outside labor costs, 1.0 million in marketing expenses, 0.5 million in depreciation expenses, and 0.4 million in commission. 
 The change in selling and marketing expenses for both periods is mainly due to discontinued marketing efforts related to the COVID-19 business and decreased revenue in BioPharma and anatomic pathology services. The decrease in facility expenses was due to terminations of certain leases. 
 General and Administrative 
 Our consolidated general and administrative expenses increased by 3.5 million, or 20 , from 17.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 21.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in consolidated general and administrative expenses was due to increases of 4.2 million in personnel costs including equity-based compensation expenses, and 3.3 million in provision for credit losses, partially offset by decreases of 3.1 million in legal expenses, 0.5 million in facility expenses, and 0.4 million in depreciation expenses. 
 Our consolidated general and administrative expenses increased by 6.5 million, or 11 , from 57.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 63.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in consolidated general and administrative expenses was due to increases of 9.5 million in personnel expense including equity-based compensation expenses and 1.1 million in provision for credit losses, partially offset by decreases of 2.7 million in legal expenses and 1.4 million in business insurance. 
 The increase in personnel expenses was primarily due to equity awards granted after the third quarter of 2023; the decrease in legal expenses was due to reversal of overly accrued legal liabilities; the decrease in business insurance was due to savings from consolidating coverages and service providers; and the change in facility expenses was due to the relocation of certain facilities and termination of certain leases. 
 29 

Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets represents amortization expenses on the intangible assets that arose from the business combinations in prior years. The Company did not have any new business combinations in the current period. 
 Other Income (Expenses) 
 Other income, net, is primarily comprised of interest income, which was 8.1 million and 23.2 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 6.5 million and 15.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and impairment of available-for-sale debt securities of 10.1 million in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. This interest income included interest earned on marketable securities and realized gain or loss on sale of marketable securities. The increase in interest income was primarily due to increased interest rates on marketable securities relative to the prior comparative period. 
 (Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes 
 (Benefit from) provision for income taxes was (3.8) million and (6.3) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 20.3 million and 12.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates were 21 and 14 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 296 and (42) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in the effective tax rate compared to prior period is due to the valuation allowance in the current period that precludes us from recognizing the benefit from our net operating losses. 
 Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest represents net loss attributable to the minority shareholders from entities not wholly owned. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity and Sources of Cash 
 We had 815.4 million and 847.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our marketable securities primarily consist of U.S. government and U.S. agency debt securities, U.S. treasury bills, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and Yankee debt securities. 
 Our primary uses of cash are to fund our operations, repurchase our stock, and to fund strategic acquisitions as we continue to invest in and seek to grow our business. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of our expense payments, as reflected in the changes in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. Cash provided by operations has significantly contributed to our ability to meet our liquidity needs, including paying for capital expenditures; however, cash provided by our operations has in the past experienced fluctuations from period to period, which we expect may continue in the future. These fluctuations can occur because of a variety of factors, including, among others, factors relating to the demand for our tests, the amount and timing of sales, the prices we charge for our tests due to changes in product mix, customer mix, general price degradation for tests, or other factors, seasonality, the rate and timing of our billing and collections cycles and the timing and amount of our commitments and other payments. Moreover, even if our liquidity expectations are correct, we may still seek to raise additional capital through securities offerings, credit facilities or other debt financings, asset sales or collaborations or licensing arrangements. 
 If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. Additionally, any preferred stock we issue could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our issuance of any additional equity securities, or the possibility of such an issuance, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The terms of any debt securities we issue or borrowings we incur, if available, could impose significant restrictions on our operations, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity or other restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, and would result in increased fixed payment obligations. If we seek to sell assets or enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms or relinquish or license to a third party our rights to important or valuable technologies or tests we may otherwise seek to develop ourselves. Moreover, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital, including investment banking, legal and accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other similar costs. Additional funding may not be available to us when needed, on acceptable terms or 
 30 

at all. If we are not able to secure funding if and when needed and on reasonable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more sales and marketing initiatives, research and development programs or other growth plans or strategies. In addition, we may be forced to work with a partner on one or more aspects of our tests or market development programs or initiatives, which could lower the economic value to us of these tests, programs or initiatives. Any such outcome could significantly harm our business, performance and prospects.

Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operations used 4.0 million of cash, as compared to 12.1 million provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash from operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the corresponding period in 2023 was primarily due to ITCs purchased for 24.6 million in cash in 2024, partially offset by the timing of cash payments for operating expenses. We expect to incur more operating expenses and use more cash in operating activities in the coming quarters as a result of our planned and ongoing clinical trials for FID-007 and as we continue to invest resources to grow our laboratory services business. 
 Investing Activities 
 The cash provided by or used in investing activities are impacted by capital expenditures for operation needs and timing of payments, timing of maturities of marketable securities, and discretionary business combinations and other investment. 
 Cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 30.9 million, which primarily represents 374.2 million for purchases of marketable securities and 36.5 million for purchases of fixed assets, including real estate consisting of the property where our Alpharetta, Georgia laboratory is located, partially offset by proceeds of 278.0 million from maturities of marketable securities and proceeds of 101.5 million from sales of marketable securities. 
 Cash provided by investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 14.6 million, which primarily represents proceeds of 376.9 million from maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by 343.6 million for purchases of marketable securities and 19.1 million on purchases of fixed assets, including real estate. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.5 million, which primarily related to 2.7 million common stock withholding for employee tax obligations and 1.2 million for repayment of the notes payable. 
 Cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 21.8 million, which primarily related to 15.0 million repayment to the margin loan account, 2.4 million repayment to the notes payable, 2.2 million repurchase of common stock, and 1.6 million common stock withholding for employee tax obligations. 
 We do not expect to use any credit facilities for the foreseeable future due to the strong cash position as of September 30, 2024. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 In March 2022, the Board authorized a 250.0 million stock repurchase program. Under the stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The stock repurchase program has no expiration from the date of authorization. 
 31 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased zero and 10,000 shares of our common stock, respectively, at an aggregate cost of 0.2 million, under the stock repurchase program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 80,000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 2.2 million under the stock repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, a total of approximately 150.5 million remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under the stock repurchase program. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or estimates from the information provided in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for information about recent accounting pronouncements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have during the periods presented, and do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitativ e Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our 2023 Annual Report. There were no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Item 4. Contr ols and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control (as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act) over the financial reporting during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Because of these inherent limitations, our disclosure and internal controls may not prevent or detect all instances of fraud, misstatements or other control issues. In addition, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure or internal controls to future periods are subject to risks, including, among others, that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 32 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings and similar matters arising in the ordinary course of our business. As disclosed in Note 8, Debt, Commitments, and Contingencies , to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we are engaged in certain legal proceedings, claims, investigations, audits, and voluntary disclosure processes; and the disclosure set forth in Note 8 relating to these certain legal matters is incorporated herein by reference. 
 The outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. 
 Regardless of outcome, such matters can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and reputational harm, among other factors. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Except as set forth in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 3, 2024 and August 2, 2024, respectively, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of the 2023 Annual Report.
