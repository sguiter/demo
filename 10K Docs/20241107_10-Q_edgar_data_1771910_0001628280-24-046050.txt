All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding our future catalysts, results of operations and financial position, business and commercial strategy, market opportunities, products and product candidates, research pipeline, ongoing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory submissions and approvals, research and development costs, projected revenues and expenses and the timing of revenues and expenses, timing and likelihood of success, as well as plans and objectives of management for future operations are forward-looking statements. Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as anticipate, believe, could, expect, should, plan, intend, estimate, will and potential, among others. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information available to our management at the time such statements are made. Such statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to various factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the substantial net losses that we have incurred since our inception, our expectation to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and our need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and execute our business plan; 
 our indebtedness under the loan agreement and guaranty (the Loan Agreement with certain affiliates and/or funds managed by each of Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. and Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC, as lenders, and Blue Owl Opportunistic Master Fund I, L.P., as administrative agent, and the associated restrictive covenants thereunder; 
 the purchase and sale agreement (the HCR Agreement with certain entities managed by HealthCare Royalty Management, LLC HCR and its negative effect on the amount of cash that we are able to generate from sales of, and licensing agreements involving, ZYNLONTA and on our attractiveness as an acquisition target; 
 our ability to complete clinical trials on expected timelines, if at all; 
 the timing, outcome and results of ongoing or planned clinical trials, whether the Company sponsored trials or through investigator initiated trials, and the sufficiency of such results; 
 undesirable side effects or adverse events of our products and product candidates; 
 our and our partners ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our product and product candidates; 
 our and our partners ability to successfully commercialize our products; 
 the availability and scope of coverage and reimbursement for our products;

Table of Contents 

 Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond our control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise. 
 
 In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

 The Company recognized the proportionate share of Overland ADCT BioPharma s net loss up to the investment carrying amount. The equity method investment in Overland ADCT Biopharma was reduced to during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and no further losses will be recorded in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as the Company has not incurred legal or constructive obligations or committed to additional funding on behalf of the joint venture.

 million and million, respectively, relative to loss before income taxes of million and million, respectively. The income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was million and million, respectively, relative to loss before income taxes of million and million, respectively. The expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of income generated by our UK operations for which tax expense has been recognized based on a full year estimated income tax liability, and the inability to recognize benefit on losses in the U.S. and Switzerland. Whereas the benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of income generated in the U.S. and UK and a provision to return adjustment from prior year. The decrease in income for the U.S. operations is due to a change in the Company operating and transfer pricing model which was implemented in October 2023. We retain a full valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets, and each reporting period, we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and adjust our estimates as more information becomes available.

 common shares.

Each warrant is exercisable, on a cash or a cashless basis, at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to May 19, 2025. The warrant obligation, which is included in other long-term liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, is remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period.

 of the Company s common shares were sold to public investors at a price of per share and pre-funded warrants (the 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase of the Company s common shares were sold to public investors at a price of per pre-funded warrant, which equals the per share 2024 Equity Offering price, less the CHF exercise price for each pre-funded warrant (collectively, the 2024 Equity Offering ). Gross proceeds from the 2024 Equity Offering were approximately million, and, after giving effect to million of transaction costs related to the offering, net proceeds were approximately million. 
 
 The 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants are exercisable, on a cash basis (or, if there is no registration statement and current prospectus covering the issuance of the shares upon exercise, then on a cashless basis), at the option of the holder after the date of issuance until the tenth anniversary of their original issuance. At any time during the last days of the term, the holder may exchange the Pre-Funded Warrant for, and we will issue, a new pre-funded warrant for the number of common shares then remaining under the Pre-Funded Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants have certain limitations on exercise, including (i) any exercise must be for at least common shares (or, if less, the remaining common shares available for purchase under the Pre-Funded Warrants), (ii) a holder cannot exercise for any amount that would cause such holder s beneficial ownership of our common shares to exceed (or with notice to us), and (iii) cashless exercise is not available in certain circumstances as specified in the Pre-Funded Warrants. The warrants contain customary anti-dilution adjustments and will entitle holders to receive any dividends or other distributions paid on the underlying common shares prior to their expiration on an as-exercised basis. 
 
 Accounting for the 2024 Equity Offering and Pre-Funded Warrants 
 
 The Company has accounted for the common shares and 2024 Pre-funded Warrants described above each as freestanding financial instruments. 
 
 The common shares were issued from the Company s share capital and treasury shares at par value. The common shares were recorded as million to equity for the issuance of the common shares, net of transaction costs accrued and paid, and an increase in cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 The warrants are freestanding financial instruments that are indexed to the Company s common stock and meet all other conditions for equity classification under ASC 480 and ASC 815, including the warrant holders cannot require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, and there is sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle the warrants. Accordingly, these warrants are recognized as million in equity and accounted for as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance, net of transaction costs paid, and an increase in cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Transaction costs have been allocated to the warrants and the common shares based on the relative fair value method. Transaction costs associated to the warrants and common shares have been deducted from the respective instrument in equity.

 Share Options 
 
 Pursuant to the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, the Conditional Share Capital Plan and Inducement Plan (the Share-based Compensation Plans ), the Company may grant share options to its directors, certain employees and service providers working for the benefit of the Company at the time. The exercise price per share option is set by the Company at the fair market value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant, as determined by the Company, which is generally the closing share price of the Company s common shares traded on the NYSE. The awards generally vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant, and thereafter evenly on a monthly basis over the subsequent . The contractual term of each share option award granted is . Under the grant, the options may be settled only in common shares of the Company. Therefore, the grants of share options under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan and Inducement Plan have been accounted for as equity-settled under US GAAP. As such, the Company records a charge for the vested portion of award grants and for partially earned but non-vested portions of award grants. This results in a front-loaded charge to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital within equity on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 The expense recognized for services received during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively, and and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the expected volatility was based on the Company s historical volatility and selected volatility determined by median values observed among other comparable public companies. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, the Company s expected volatility is no longer determined by values observed among other comparable companies and is now based solely on the Company s historical volatility. The award life for options granted was based on the time interval between the date of grant and the date during the life after which, when making the grant, the Company expected on average that participants would exercise their options. 
 
 RSUs 
 Pursuant to the Share-based Compensation Plans, the Company may grant RSUs to its directors, certain employees and service providers working for the benefit of the Company at the time. The awards generally vest annually over a period of two to commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The RSUs may be settled only in common shares of the Company. Therefore, the grant of RSUs under both the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan and Conditional Share Capital Plan have been accounted for as equity-settled under US GAAP. As such, the Company records a charge for the vested portion of award grants and for partially earned but non-vested portions of award grants. This results in a front-loaded charge to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital within equity on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in this Quarterly Report, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements. 

Business Overview 
 ADC Therapeutics is a leading, commercial-stage global pioneer in the field of antibody drug conjugates ADCs ). 
 
 Our goal is to be a leading ADC company that transforms the lives of those impacted by cancer. To achieve this, we are focused on unlocking the potential value of our robust ADC portfolio across two pillars of growth: hematology and solid tumors. We are a pioneer in the ADC field with specialized end-to-end capabilities unique to ADCs including a validated technology platform, a growing next-generation research development toolbox and a proven track record that includes an approved and marketed product. We aim to expand our portfolio and accelerate the development of our pipeline through targeted investments and in collaboration with strategic partners. In this way, we plan to pursue multiple targets in parallel, enabling us to prioritize and ensure a disciplined capital allocation strategy while advancing the most promising candidates in both hematologic and solid tumors. 
 
 In our hematology program, our flagship product, ZYNLONTA, a CD19-directed ADC, received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA and conditional approval from the European Commission for the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy. We have a direct commercialization model in the U.S. to help drive growth of ZYNLONTA. Outside the U.S., we continue to advance the development and commercialization of ZYNLONTA through strategic partnerships. We are seeking to continue expanding ZYNLONTA internationally, and into earlier lines of DLBCL and other indolent lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma FL and marginal zone lymphoma MZL as a single and combination agent of choice through our LOTIS-5 confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial and LOTIS-7 Phase1b clinical trial as well as through investigator-initiated trials IITs at leading institutions. In addition, we are investigating a CD-22 targeted compound, ADCT-602, in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center in a Phase 1/2 investigator-initiated study in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 
 
 In our solid tumor program, we have a pipeline of early stage pre-clinical research programs, and our clinical-stage program ADCT-601 (mipasetamab uzoptirine) targeting AXL as a single agent and/or in combination in sarcoma, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC ). Based on the available clinical data and capital requirements for continued development, we have made the decision to discontinue the phase 1b ADCT-601 program. Although early signs of antitumor activity were observed during the dose escalation phase, we were unable to demonstrate a favorable benefit-risk profile during the dose optimization/expansion phase. Our pre-clinical stage pipeline includes a portfolio of next generation investigational ADCs targeting Claudin-6, PSMA, NaPi2b and ASCT2. Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies are in progress for ADC targeting Claudin-6, PSMA and NaPi2b programs while ASCT2 targeting ADC is in drug candidate selection stage and is expected to be completed this year. In addition, we are advancing research with a range of payloads, linkers and conjugation technologies against undisclosed targets.

 Revenue 
 
 Product Revenues, net 
 We generate product revenue through the sale of ZYNLONTA in the United States. Revenue is recognized when control is transferred to the customer at the net selling price, which includes reductions for gross-to-net GTN sales adjustments such as government rebates, chargebacks, distributor service fees, other rebates and administrative fees, sales returns and allowances and sales discounts. In the long term, we expect that our product revenue will increase as we execute our business strategy, although our product revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on a number of factors, including patient demand, as well as the timing, dose and duration, of patient therapy and customers buying patterns and gross-to-net deductions. We may also experience variability in GTN sales adjustments as a percentage of gross sales due to additional information and actual experience such as actual rebate and return rates. 
 Product revenues, net, were 18.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.7 million, or 26.3 . The increase is primarily driven by higher sales volume and a higher selling price. The increase in product revenues is also attributable to lower GTN deductions primarily due to a lower discarded drug rebate accrual for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 License revenues and royalties 
 We generate license revenue and royalties from our strategic agreements for the development and commercialization of ZYNLONTA and other product candidates outside of the United States. Under these agreements, we receive upfront payments and are eligible for certain milestone payments and royalties. We are unable to predict the timing and amounts of 
 23 

Table of Contents 

license revenue and royalties as meeting milestones is subject to many factors outside of our control and we have limited control over our partners commercialization efforts. 
 Royalties were 448 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 226 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Cost of Product Sales 
 Cost of product sales primarily includes direct and indirect costs relating to the third-party manufacture and distribution of ZYNLONTA, royalties payable to a collaboration partner based on net product sales of ZYNLONTA and inventory write-downs. We expect that cost of product sales will increase over time as we sell through pre-approval inventory that was previously expensed prior to commercialization under U.S. GAAP. Factors such as inflation may also increase our cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue if we are not able to increase the price at which we sell ZYNLONTA to offset such increases in our cost of product sales. 
 Cost of product sales were 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cost of product sales of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 an increase of 0.6 million, or 309.1 . The increase in cost of product sales was primarily driven by higher commercial shipping, storage and stability costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for our major development programs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 (1) Beginning in September 30, 2024, Cami, ADCT-901 and ADCT-212 were included in Discontinued programs. Prior to September 30, 2024 these programs were separately presented as major development programs. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. 
 (2) Includes third-party contracting and employee expenses, as well as expense for preclinical research, storage, shipping and lab consumables that span multiple programs. 
 
 Research and development expense consists primarily of employee related expenses, including share-based compensation expense; costs for production of preclinical and clinical-stage product candidates by CMOs; fees and other costs paid to contract research organizations in connection with the performance of preclinical studies and clinical trials; costs of related facilities, materials and equipment; external costs associated with obtaining intellectual property; depreciation; and upfront fees and achieved milestone payments associated with R D collaboration arrangements. 
 Our R D expenses were 32.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 27.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 5.4 million, or 20.0 , primarily due to higher spend on ZYNLONTA, ADCT-601 and other R D research strategy, platform and pipeline initiatives, partially offset by other productivity and cost savings initiatives and decreased spending on discontinued programs, as discussed below. 
 
 ZYNLONTA 
 Research and development expenses for ZYNLONTA were 18.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 17.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.1 million. The increase was primarily due to higher chemistry, manufacturing and controls CMC expense of 1.8 million for LOTIS 5 and LOTIS

Table of Contents 

7, partially offset by lower professional fees of 0.5 million related to ZYNLONTA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of productivity initiatives and portfolio prioritization. 
 
 ADCT-601 
 Research and development expenses for ADCT-601 were 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.4 million. The increase is primarily attributable to higher patient enrollment and progress towards the completion of the study. The ADCT-601 program will be discontinued and is no longer enrolling patients. 
 Preclinical product candidates and research pipeline 
 Research and development expenses associated with our preclinical product candidates and research pipeline were 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to increased spending on our research strategy, platform and pipeline initiatives including Claudin-6, PSMA and ASCT2. 
 
 Discontinued programs 
 
 Spending on our discontinued programs have decreased from 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.7 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.8 million. The decrease was attributable to decreased spending on ADCT-901 of 1.2 million, Cami of 0.3 million and ADCT-212 of 0.3 million. 
 
 Share-based compensation 
 
 Share-based compensation expense was 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.8 million. The increase was primarily driven by fluctuations in our share price and forfeitures of awards in connection with employee terminations during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses

 General and administrative expenses were 10.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 9.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.4 million, or 3.9 . External costs and overhead costs decreased primarily as a result of lower insurance costs of 0.4 million. The increase in employee expenses was primarily due to higher wages, benefits and recruitment costs of 1.0 million. The decrease in share-based compensation expense was primarily due to fluctuations in our share price. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income includes interest received from banks on our cash balances. Our policy is to invest funds in a variety of capital preservation instruments, which may include all or a combination of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term interest-bearing instruments, investment-grade securities, and direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. 
 Interest income was 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.7 million. The increase was due to higher average cash balances and higher yields received on cash deposits. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense is primarily related to the accretion of our deferred royalty obligation with HCR and the senior secured term loan facility. Interest expense was 13.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.3 million, or 2.3 . The increase was related to higher accretion of our deferred royalty obligation with HCR. 
 Other, net 
 Other, net consists primarily of changes in the fair value (gains or losses) of the Deerfield warrant obligation; and cumulative catch-up adjustments related to our deferred royalty obligation. 
 Other, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Deerfield warrant obligation, change in fair value income 1,130 140 990 Cumulative catch-up adjustment income, deferred royalty obligation 206 437 (231) Exchange differences gain 21 39 (18) R D tax credit 267 244 23 Total 1,624 860 764

Table of Contents 

Deerfield Warrant Obligation, Change in Fair Value Income 
 Pursuant to an Exchange Agreement with Deerfield entered into on August 15, 2022, the Company issued warrants to Deerfield to purchase an aggregate of 4,412,840 common shares. The Deerfield warrant obligation has been recorded at its initial fair value at the time the agreement was entered into on August 15, 2022 and is remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period. The income of 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in projected volatility of the underlying shares during the period while the income of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in fair value of the underlying shares during the respective period. 
 
 Cumulative catch-up adjustment income, deferred royalty obligation 
 
 We periodically assess the expected payments to HCR based on our underlying revenue projections and to the extent the amount or timing of such payments is materially different than our initial estimates we will record a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the deferred royalty obligation. The adjustment to the carrying amount is recognized in Other, net as an adjustment in the period in which the change in estimate occurred. The cumulative catch-up adjustment income of 0.2 million and 0.4 million as a result of changes in the deferred royalty obligation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was primarily due to the quarterly revenue results incorporated into the valuation model during the respective periods. 
 
 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit 
 We are subject to corporate taxation in Switzerland. We are also subject to taxation in other jurisdictions in which we operate, in particular, the United States and the United Kingdom, where our two wholly-owned subsidiaries are incorporated. We recorded an income tax (expense) benefit of (0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily driven by the new transfer pricing model which was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Equity in Net Losses of Joint Venture 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Share of Overland ADCT BioPharma net loss (260) (1,409) 1,149 
 
 We recorded our proportionate share of Overland ADCT BioPharma s net loss of 0.3 million and 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 we recorded our share of Overland ADCT Biopharma s net loss up until the point at which our share of losses exceeded our interest in Overland ADCT BioPharma. Losses were not recognized in excess of our total investment, as we have not incurred legal or constructive obligations or committed to additional funding on behalf of the joint venture.

 Revenue 
 
 Product Revenues, net 
 We generate product revenue through the sale of ZYNLONTA in the United States. Revenue is recognized when control is transferred to the customer at the net selling price, which includes reductions for gross-to-net GTN sales adjustments such as government rebates, chargebacks, distributor service fees, other rebates and administrative fees, sales returns and allowances and sales discounts. In the long term, we expect that our product revenue will increase as we execute our business strategy, although our product revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on a number of factors, including patient demand, as well as the timing, dose and duration, of patient therapy and customers buying patterns and GTN deductions. We expect a similar level of GTN sales adjustments as a percentage of gross sales, and may also experience variability in GTN sales adjustments due to additional information and actual experience such as actual rebate and return rates. 
 
 Product revenues, net, was 52.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 52.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.5 million, or 0.9 . The increase is primarily attributable to a higher price, partially offset by lower sales volume. 
 
 License revenues and royalties 
 We generate license revenue and royalties from our strategic agreements for the development and commercialization of ZYNLONTA and other product candidates outside of the United States. Under these agreements, we receive upfront payments and are eligible for certain milestone payments and royalties. We are unable to predict the timing and amounts of 
 28 

Table of Contents 

license revenue and royalties as meeting milestones is subject to many factors outside of our control and we have limited control over our partners commercialization efforts. 
 Royalties were 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Cost of Product Sales 
 Cost of product sales primarily includes direct and indirect costs relating to the third-party manufacture and distribution of ZYNLONTA, royalties payable to a collaboration partner based on net product sales of ZYNLONTA and inventory write-downs. We expect that cost of product sales will increase over time as we sell through pre-approval inventory that was previously expensed prior to commercialization under U.S. GAAP. Factors such as inflation may also increase our cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue if we are not able to increase the price at which we sell ZYNLONTA to offset such increases in our cost of product sales. 
 Cost of product sales were 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cost of product sales of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to a 1.1 million batch cancellation fee, higher stability, shipping and storage costs of 1.2 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 0.6 million increase in our excess inventory reserve, and a 0.3 million manufacturing credit received from a contract manufacturer which was recorded as a reduction to cost of product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for our major development programs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change ZYNLONTA 45,356 52,826 (7,470) ADCT-601 13,470 6,738 6,732 ADCT-602 985 1,201 (216) Preclinical product candidates and research pipeline 12,011 7,725 4,286 Discontinued programs (1) 
 3,369 19,435 (16,066) Not allocated to specific programs (2) 
 6,492 5,674 818 Share-based compensation expense 849 3,198 (2,349) Research and development expenses 82,532 96,797 (14,265) 
 (1) Beginning in September 30, 2024, Cami, ADCT-901 and ADCT-212 were included in Discontinued programs. Prior to September 30, 2024 these programs were separately presented as major development programs. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. 
 (2) Includes third-party contracting and employee expenses, as well as expense for preclinical research, storage, shipping and lab consumables that span multiple programs. 
 
 Research and development expense consists primarily of employee related expenses, including share-based compensation expense; costs for production of preclinical and clinical-stage product candidates by CMOs; fees and other costs paid to contract research organizations in connection with the performance of preclinical studies and clinical trials; costs of related facilities, materials and equipment; external costs associated with obtaining intellectual property; depreciation; and upfront fees and achieved milestone payments associated with R D collaboration arrangements. 
 Our R D expenses were 82.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 96.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 14.3 million, or 14.7 , primarily due to lower spending on ZYNLONTA and focused investment toward prioritized development programs, as discussed below. 
 
 ZYNLONTA 
 
 Research and development expenses for ZYNLONTA were 45.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 52.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 7.5 million. The decrease was 
 29 

Table of Contents 

primarily due to lower clinical trial costs for LOTIS 3, LOTIS 5, LOTIS 6 and LOTIS 7 of 2.6 million, as well as lower professional fees of 1.9 million related to ZYNLONTA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of productivity initiatives and portfolio prioritization. 
 
 ADCT-601 
 Research and development expenses for ADCT-601 were 13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 6.7 million. The increase is primarily attributable to higher patient enrollment and progress towards the completion of the study. The ADCT-601 program will be discontinued and is no longer enrolling patients. 
 Preclinical product candidates and research pipeline 
 Research and development expenses associated with our preclinical product candidates and research pipeline were 12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4.3 million. The increase is primarily attributable to increased spending on our research strategy, platform and pipeline initiatives including Claudin-6, Napi2b, PSMA and ASCT2. 
 
 Discontinued programs 
 
 Spending on our discontinued programs including Cami, ADCT-901 and ADCT-212 have decreased from 19.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.4 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 16.1 million. The decrease was attributable to decreased spending on Cami of 8.4 million, ADCT-212 of 4.4 million and ADCT-901 of 3.3 million. 
 
 Share-based compensation 
 
 Share-based compensation expense was 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2.3 million. The decrease was primarily driven by fluctuations in our share price as well as forfeitures of awards in connection with employee terminations. 
 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses 
 The following table summarizes our selling and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change External costs and overhead 15,718 23,724 (8,006) Employee expenses (1) 
 17,134 19,563 (2,429) Share-based compensation (reversal) expense (88) 250 (338) Selling and marketing expenses 32,764 43,537 (10,773) 
 (1) Excludes share-based compensation expense. 
 Selling and marketing costs S M are expensed as incurred and are primarily attributable to commercialization of ZYNLONTA in the United States. S M includes employee costs and share-based compensation expense for commercial employees and external costs related to commercialization (including professional fees, communication costs and IT costs, travel expenses and depreciation of property and equipment). 
 
 Selling and marketing expenses were 32.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 43.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 10.8 million or 24.7 . The decrease in external costs and overhead was primarily attributable to 8.4 million in lower spend on marketing and advertising expenses as a result of reduced spending initiatives within the U.S., partially offset by higher travel and IT expenses of 0.4 million. The decrease in employee expenses was primarily due to lower wages and benefits of 2.2 million primarily due to decreased headcount, as well as lower recruitment costs of 0.2 million. The decrease in share-based compensation expense of 0.3 
 30 

Table of Contents 

million was primarily due to fluctuations in our share price as well as forfeitures of awards in connection with employee terminations. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change External costs and overhead 13,675 14,716 (1,041) Employee expenses (1) 
 14,405 14,586 (181) Share-based compensation expense 4,191 7,827 (3,636) General and administrative expenses 32,271 37,129 (4,858) 
 (1) Excludes share-based compensation expense. 
 General and administrative expense includes employee expenses (including share-based compensation expense) for general and administrative employees, external costs (including, in particular, professional fees, legal costs associated with maintaining patents and other intellectual property, communications costs and IT costs, facility expenses and travel expenses), depreciation of property and equipment, depreciation of right-of-use assets and amortization of intangible assets. 
 General and administrative expenses were 32.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 37.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4.9 million, or 13.1 . The decrease in external costs and overhead was primarily related to lower insurance and IT costs of 1.1 million. The decrease in employee expenses was primarily due to lower wages and benefits of 0.4 million partially offset by higher recruitment costs of 0.2 million. The decrease in share-based compensation expense was primarily due to fluctuations in our share price as well as forfeitures of awards in connection with employee terminations. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income includes interest received from banks on our cash balances. Our policy is to invest funds in a variety of capital preservation instruments, which may include all or a combination of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term interest-bearing instruments, investment-grade securities, and direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. 
 Interest income was 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.4 million or 33.0 . The increase was due to higher average cash balances and higher yields received on cash deposits. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense is primarily related to the accretion of our deferred royalty obligation with HCR and the senior secured term loan facility. Interest expense was 38.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 33.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.9 million, or 14.6 . The increase was related to higher accretion of our deferred royalty obligation with HCR as a result of the 73.1 million, net of transaction costs, received in June 2023 upon the first commercial sale of ZYNLONTA in the United Kingdom or any European Union country, which increased the liability. 
 Other, net 
 Other, net consists primarily of changes in the fair value (gains or losses) of the Deerfield warrant obligation; and cumulative catch-up adjustments related to our deferred royalty obligation. 
 Other, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included the following: 
 31 

Table of Contents 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Deerfield warrant obligation, change in fair value income 292 776 (484) Cumulative catch-up adjustment income (expense), deferred royalty obligation 732 (4,851) 5,583 Exchange differences (loss) gain (75) 2 (77) R D tax credit 834 699 135 Total 1,783 (3,374) 5,157 
 
 Deerfield Warrant Obligation, Change in Fair Value Income 
 
 Pursuant to an Exchange Agreement with Deerfield entered into on August 15, 2022, the Company issued warrants to Deerfield to purchase an aggregate of 4,412,840 common shares. The Deerfield warrant obligation has been recorded at its initial fair value at the time the agreement was entered into on August 15, 2022 and is remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period. The income of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in the projected volatility of the underlying shares partially offset by an increase in fair value of the underlying shares during the respective period while the income of 0.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in fair value of the underlying shares during the respective period. 
 Cumulative catch-up adjustment income (expense), deferred royalty obligation 
 
 We periodically assess the expected payments to HCR based on our underlying revenue projections and to the extent the amount or timing of such payments is materially different than our initial estimates we will record a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the deferred royalty obligation. The adjustment to the carrying amount is recognized in Other, net as an adjustment in the period in which the change in estimate occurred. The cumulative catch-up adjustment income (expense) was 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to (4.9) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a change of 5.6 million. The change was primarily due to revised revenue forecasts incorporated into the valuation model in 2023, which revisions were primarily attributable to the Company s updated strategic and development plans. 
 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 We are subject to corporate taxation in Switzerland. We are also subject to taxation in other jurisdictions in which we operate, in particular, the United States and the United Kingdom, where our two wholly-owned subsidiaries are incorporated. We recorded an income tax (expense) of (0.5) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to an income tax benefit of 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by our U.S. and UK operations and transfer pricing model which was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Equity in Net Losses of Joint Venture 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Share of Overland ADCT BioPharma net loss (1,544) (3,539) 1,995 
 
 We recorded our proportionate share of Overland ADCT BioPharma s net loss of 1.5 million and 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recorded our share of Overland ADCT BioPharma s net loss up until the point at which our share of losses exceeded our interest in Overland ADCT BioPharma. Losses were not recognized in excess of our total investment, as we have not incurred legal or constructive obligations or committed to additional funding on behalf of the joint venture. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 274.3 million and believe that our current cash position and capital resources are sufficient to fund our operation and meet capital requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of this report. 
 32 

Table of Contents 

We had an accumulated deficit of 1,462.6 million as of September 30, 2024 , and our operations have historically been funded primarily through equity offerings, debt financings and royalty financing arrangements. 
 
 We plan to continue to fund our operating needs through our existing cash and cash equivalents, revenues from sales of ZYNLONTA, potential milestone and royalty payments under our licensing agreements and additional equity financings, debt financings and/or other forms of financing, as well as funds provided by collaborations. We are continuously exploring strategic collaborations, business combinations, licensing opportunities or similar strategies for clinical development and commercialization of ZYNLONTA and/or our product candidates. However, we may be unable to obtain such financing, licensing and collaboration arrangements on favorable terms, if at all. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 To date, we have financed our operations primarily through equity financings, convertible debt and senior secured term loan financings, and additional funds provided by collaborations and royalty financings and sales of ZYNLONTA in the United States. For a description of the Loan Agreement, HCR Agreement and other license and collaboration agreements, see Item 1. Business - Material Contracts in our Annual Report. 
 In May 2024, we completed an underwritten offering which resulted in net proceeds of approximately 97.4 million. In August 2024, we filed a prospectus relating to an at-the-market offering program, pursuant to which we may offer and sell our common shares from time to time with an aggregate offering price of 100 million, subject to share limitations, through Jefferies LLC acting as sales agent. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares under the program. 
 
 Uses of Capital Resources 
 Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, research and development expenses, selling and marketing expenses, compensation and related expenses, interest and principal payments on debt obligations and other operating expenses. We expect to incur substantial expenses as we continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and marketing and commercialization efforts, in particular to grow ZYNLONTA in the 3L+ DLBCL setting, continue to study and advance ZYNLONTA in earlier lines of therapy and in combinations to potentially expand our market opportunity and further develop our pipeline and our ADC platform. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as the timing of collecting receivables from the sale of ZYNLONTA and paying royalties related to our deferred royalty obligation. 

Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (101,983) (87,053) (14,930) Investing activities (777) (2,889) 2,112 Financing activities 98,174 73,876 24,298 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (4,586) (16,066) 11,480 
 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 102.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 87.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 14.9 million. The increase in cash used in operating activities on a period over period basis was primarily due to the receipt of the 50.0 million in Sobi license milestone during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which was recognized in revenue in December 2022 upon approval of the Marketing Authorisation Application by the European Commission for ZYNLONTA in third-line DLBCL, partially offset by the lower net loss for the period of 27.9 million attributable to a decrease in operating expenses and the timing of cash payments and receipts.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2.1 million. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities relates to timing of purchases of property and equipment. 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 98.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily related to the net proceeds received from the completion of the Company s 2024 Equity Offering in May 2024. Net cash provided by financing activities was 73.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and primarily related to the proceeds received under the deferred royalty obligation with HCR upon the first commercial sale of ZYNLONTA in the United Kingdom or any European Union country.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. The results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not believe that we are party to any claim or litigation, the outcome of which would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Below we are providing, in supplemental form, additions to our risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

We do not control the conduct of current or any potential future investigator-initiated clinical trials, and the data from such trials is not subject to our review or quality control. 
 
 We have provided clinical data from an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of ZYNLONTA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma. In the future, we may provide clinical data from this and other investigator-initiated clinical trials. We do not control the design or administration of such trials, nor the submission, approval or maintenance of any regulatory and institutional filings required to conduct such trials. Furthermore, we have limited or no rights to audit, review or apply quality control procedures to the clinical data generated from such trials. As a result, we have no control over the conduct of such trials and the timing of any data releases from such trials and we cannot be certain that such trials are or will be conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or that the clinical data provided to us by the investigators of such trials are accurate, reliable or complete. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome or timing of any IITs, including whether such trials will meet their respective endpoint and whether severe adverse events will occur during the trials. In addition, positive preliminary results in any ongoing IIT may not be predictive of results in the completed trial. 
 
 Our articles of association provide that the competent court with jurisdiction over our registered office in Switzerland will be the exclusive forum for shareholder suits against us, members of our board of directors or members of our executive committee. 
 
 Our articles of association provide that the competent court with jurisdiction over our registered office in Switzerland will be the exclusive forum for shareholder suits against us, members of our board of directors or members of our executive committee; provided that the foregoing provision does not apply to claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any claim for which the courts in the United States have exclusive jurisdiction. This forum selection provision may impose additional litigation costs on shareholders in pursuing any such claims, particularly if the shareholders do not reside in or near Switzerland and limit a shareholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us, members of our board of directors or members of our executive committee, which may discourage lawsuits against us, members of our board of directors and members of our executive committee, although our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
