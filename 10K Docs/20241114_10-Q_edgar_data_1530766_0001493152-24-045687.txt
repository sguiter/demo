shares of its common stock to investors for net proceeds of million and
issued an aggregate of shares of its common stock in connection with acquiring assets and with know-how agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a majority interest in ViralClear of . 

On
July 2, 2020, the Company formed an additional subsidiary, NeuroClear Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was renamed to
BioSig AI Sciences, Inc. BioSig AI on May 31, 2023. The subsidiary was established to pursue clinical needs of cardiac
and neurological disorders through recordings and analyses of action potentials. BioSig AI aims to contribute to the advancements of
AI-based diagnoses and therapies. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a majority interest in BioSig AI of (see
Notes 9 and 11). 

The
Company continues to evaluate opportunities for the two subsidiaries. 

On
January 28, 2024 and February 20, 2024, management of the Company commenced a workforce reduction intended to reduce significantly the
annual cash burn which was completed as of February 20, 2024. The workforce reduction consisted of the departure of sixteen employees,
effective as of January 31, 2024 and included the departure of John Sieckhaus, the Company s Chief Operating Officer, and Gray
Fleming, the Company s Chief Commercial Officer and twenty-six employees effective February 20, 2024. The effect of the workforce
reductions has significantly reduced operations in the short term. In connection with workforce reduction, the Company issued an aggregate

On
March 5, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the Staff stating that
the Company has not regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the Company s common stock did not meet the minimum
bid price of per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market LLC Nasdaq ), and the Company
is not eligible for a second 180 day cure period under Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(2) because the Company does not comply with the 
minimum stockholders equity initial listing requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market, and that accordingly, Nasdaq would delist
the Company s common stock unless the Company requested an appeal of this determination. On March 11, 2024, the Company submitted
a request for a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to appeal the Staff s delisting determination. On March 12, 2024, the
Company received a letter from the Staff stating that based upon the Staff s review of the Company and pursuant to Listing Rule
5101, the Staff believes that the Company no longer has an operating business and is a public shell, and that the continued
listing of its securities is no longer warranted, in view of work force reductions and resignations of members of the board of directors
and officers (see below).

The
letter further stated that the Company no longer meets the requirement of Rule 5550(b)(2) to maintain a minimum Market Value of Listed
Securities of 
 million, if none of the other standards set forth
in Rule 5550(b) is met. The Staff stated that the foregoing matters serve as an additional basis for delisting the Company s common
stock from Nasdaq, and that the Hearings Panel will consider this matter in rendering a determination regarding the Company s continued
listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company appealed the foregoing determinations. The requested hearing before the Hearings Panel
was held on May 7, 2024. 

On
June 10, 2024, the Company received formal notice that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had determined to delist the Company s common
stock from Nasdaq due to the Company s continued non-compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement set forth
in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) for continued listing on Nasdaq. As a result, trading in the Company s common stock will be suspended
on Nasdaq effective with the open of business on Wednesday, June 12, 2024. The Company s common stock should be eligible to trade
on the OTC Markets Pink Current Information tier under symbol BSGM effective with the open of trading on Wednesday,
June 12, 2024. The Company seeked the Panel s reconsideration of its decision in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. 

On
June 24, 2024, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had declined to reconsider its decision dated June 10,
2024 to delist the Company s common stock from Nasdaq (the Delisting Decision ). Trading in the Company s securities
was suspended on Nasdaq effective with the open of business on June 12, 2024, at which point the Company s common stock was eligible
to trade on the OTC Market s Pink Current Information tier. 

On
July 10, 2024, the Company filed a submission in support of an appeal to the Delisting Decision to the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review
Council. 

On
July 23, 2024, the Company commenced trading of its common stock on the OTCQB, operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. 

On
October 18, 2024, the Company received a decision from the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council granting the Company a grace
period until March 7, 2025 to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) (the MVLS Rule ), which
requires a market value of listed securities of at least 
million. 

On
October 21, 2024, the Company was notified that its common stock will commence trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on Wednesday, October
23, 2024, effective at the opening of trading. 

On
October 24, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Nasdaq notifying the Company
that based upon the closing bid price of the Company s common stock from the period of June 11, 2024 through the reinstatement
date, October 23, 2024, the Company did not meet the minimum bid price of 
per share required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules Rules and as a result, the Company no longer meets this requirement.
However, the Rules also provides the Company a compliance period of 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance. 

On November 13, 2024, the Company issued a press release announcing its Nasdaq bid price compliance. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BioSig Technologies, Inc., and its majority owned subsidiaries,
ViralClear and BioSig AI. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States GAAP for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03
of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. 

The
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from audited financial statements. 

Operating
results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the
year ending December 31, 2024. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Company s Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on April 16, 2024. 

million and working capital deficit of million. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company used net cash in operating activities of million. These balances create a liquidity concern, which
in turn raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s primary source of operating funds since inception has been cash proceeds from sale of equity securities and issuance
of debt. The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these conditions
to continue for the foreseeable future. 

The
Company s plans include the continued commercialization of the PURE EP System and other applications of our core technology and
raising capital through the sale of additional equity securities, debt or capital inflows from strategic partnerships. The Company s
strategic shift to potentially hiring a team of an additional 4-6 persons to execute a business development strategy of finding partners
for the commercialization of PURE EP, develop new products in the field of Pulse Field Ablation and to continue to integrate PURE EP
into today s lab equipment will allow the Company to significantly reduce operating expenses. 

The
Company will require additional financing to fund future operations. Further, although the Company began commercial operations, there
is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund operations. In addition, there can be no assurance
that the Company s continuing research and development will be successfully completed or that any additional products will be commercially
viable.

Performance
obligations are the units of accounting for revenue recognition and generally represent the distinct goods or services that are promised
to the customer. If the Company determines that it has not satisfied a performance obligation, it will defer recognition of the revenue
until the performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied. Once the PURE EP Platform is delivered, installed, and accepted by the customer,
our performance obligation is recognized. Support, maintenance, and software upgrade rentals are performance obligations over a defined
period and are recognized rateably over the contractual service period. Customers typically purchase these services with the initial sale
of the PURE EP Platform and do not have the right to terminate their contracts unless we fail to perform material obligations. 

The
Company may execute more than one contract with a single customer. If so, it is evaluated whether the agreements were negotiated as a
package with a single objective, whether the amount of consideration to be paid in one agreement depends on the price and/or performance
of another agreement, or whether the goods or services promised in the agreements represent a single performance obligation. The conclusions
reached can impact the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation and the timing of revenue recognition related
to those arrangements. 

The

Litigation 

Threatened
litigation. 

On

of employment was in retaliation for bringing to the attention of the Company s board of directors and executives a series of wrongful
and questionable practices by members of the Company s board of directors, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
The claimant sought compensation in the amount of . After an investigation conducted by the Board and guidance of legal counsel,
it was concluded that the claim was without merit. 

On
February 22, 2024, the Company received a threat of litigation seeking restitution for losses resulting from unlawful actions taken by
the Company s board of directors. The claimant contends that he and others have sustained losses totaling . On March
22, 2024, the claimant sent another letter to the Company referencing the previous letter and requesting several documents. The Company
believes that these claims are without merit. 

On
March 22, 2024, plaintiff, Michael Gray Fleming (the Plaintiff ), filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County, Minnesota
District Court naming the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer as defendants. The
Plaintiff contends that the Company failed to meet its obligations in issuing the Plaintiff stock certificates under the terms of a
restricted stock award agreement. Plaintiff is seeking at least

vigorously. As of the date of this report, the Company is unable to provide an evaluation of the outcome of the litigation or to
provide an estimate of the amount of or a range of potential loss that might be incurred by the Company. The Company has moved to
dismiss Plaintiff s claims; a hearing was set in September 2024. The motion has been fully briefed, and the parties argued the
motion to the Court. A ruling is expected in mid-December. The Company also has learned that, following expiration of the SEC Rule
144 waiting period for affiliate/control shares, Plaintiff was able to have his restrictions removed. The Company believes that
these claims are without merit. 

We
may be subject at times to other legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of its business. Although occasional
adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters should not have a material
adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

There
are no material proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates or any registered or beneficial shareholder of more
than 5 of our common stock is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.

Business
Overview 

BioSig
Technologies is a medical device company with an advanced digital signal processing technology platform to deliver insights to the treatment
of cardiovascular arrhythmias. Through collaboration with physicians, experts, and healthcare leaders across the field of electrophysiology
(EP), we are committed to addressing healthcare s biggest priorities saving time, saving costs, and saving lives. 

Our
first product, the PURE EP System, is an FDA 510(k) cleared non-invasive class II device consisting of a unique combination of
hardware and software designed to provide unprecedented signal clarity and precision for real-time visualization of intracardiac signals
paving the way for personalized patient care. Integrating with existing systems in the EP lab, PURE EP is designed to accurately
pinpoint even the most complex signals to maximize procedural success and efficiency. 

By
capturing critical cardiac signals even the most complex, the PURE EP System is designed to enhance clinical decision-making
and improve clinical workflow for all types of arrhythmias - even the most challenging procedures for cardiac arrhythmias, like ventricular
tachycardia (VT) and atrial fibrillation (AF). 

On
July 1, 2024, the Company announced the intent to acquire the assets of Neuro-Kinesis Corporation (NKC), a privately held Los Angeles-based
medical technology company developing smart EP tools. A non-binding letter of intent (LOI) has been executed confirming BioSig s
preliminary interest in the proposed acquisition of the assets of NKC. The purchase price will be paid through the issuance of shares
of BioSig s common stock to the shareholders of NKC. In addition, at closing, NKC will provide a minimum of 2.5 million, but could

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months September 30, 2023 (000 s) 

Revenues
and Cost of Goods Sold . Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0, comprised of recognized service revenue, as
compared to 1, comprised of recognized service revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

We
derive our revenue primarily from the sale of our medical device, PURE EP Platform, as well as related support and maintenance services
and software upgrades in connection with the device. 

We
recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, Leases for lease components and ASC 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 for non-lease components. For medical device sales, we recognize revenue under
ASC 606. 

The
core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 

Research
and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 156, a decrease of
 989, or 86.38 , from 1,145 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to decreases in payroll, consulting,
Data/AI development and research and clinical studies and design work to 139 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to 1,066 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

General
and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,763, a decrease
of 52 or 1.85 , from 2,815 incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in employee
and service provider (stock-based) performance pay in the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year and additional
service provider fees paid. 

Payroll
related expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, increase to 1,744 in the current period from 1,302 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 442, or 33.95 . The increase was primarily due to increase stock-based compensation in the
current period compared to the prior period. We incurred 1,510 in stock-based compensation in connection with the vesting of stock and
stock options issued to board members, officers, employees and consultants for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared

fees in the current period as compared to the prior period. 

Consulting,
public and investor relations fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 527 as compared to 734 incurred for the three
months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 207, or 28.20 . The decrease primarily related to a reduction in investor relations,
marketing and consulting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period, last year. 

Travel,
meals and entertainment costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 99, a decrease of 66, or 40 , from 165 incurred
in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Travel, meals and entertainment costs include travel related to business development and
financing. The decrease in 2024 was due to staff reductions in 2024 as compared to 2022. 

Rent

Impairment
of Long Term Assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company re-assessed it s carrying amounts of

Revenues
and Cost of Goods Sold . Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 27, comprised of recognized service revenue, as
compared to 6, comprised of recognized service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

We
derive our revenue primarily from the sale of our medical device, PURE EP Platform, as well as related support and maintenance services
and software upgrades in connection with the device. 

We
recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, Leases for lease components and ASC 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 for non-lease components. For medical device sales, we recognize revenue under
ASC 606.

amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 

Research
and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 736, a decrease of
 3,180, or 81.21 , from 3,916 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to decreases in payroll, consulting,
Data/AI development and research and clinical studies and design work to 674 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to 6,695 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily in the BioSig Technologies segment, a decrease of 3,021 or 81.76 .

General
and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 10,559, a decrease
of 7,608 or 41.88 , from 18,167 incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease
in employee and service provider (stock-based) performance pay in the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year
and additional service provider fees paid. 

Payroll
related expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, decreased to 7,481 in the current period from 11,366 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 3,885, or 34.18 . The decrease was primarily due to reduced staff in commercialization, sales
and general and administration in the BioSig Technologies segment. We incurred 6,508 in stock-based compensation in connection with
the vesting of stock and stock options issued to board members, officers, employees and consultants for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to 5,534 in stock-based compensation for the same period in 2023.

a decrease of 24, or 4.14 , from 580 incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in legal fees are primarily
due to costs reduced costs incurred in 2024 for contract work and patent filings for the BioSig Technologies segment as compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. Accounting fees incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 139, a decrease

months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1,747, or 63.92 . The decrease primarily related to a reduction in investor relations,
marketing and consulting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period, last year. 

Travel,
meals and entertainment costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 308, a decrease of 285, or 48.06 , from 593 incurred
in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Travel, meals and entertainment costs include travel related to business development and
financing. The decrease in 2024 was due to staff reductions in 2024 as compared to 2022.

Summary
Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023 are detailed in Note 13 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources and Going Concern 000 s) 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 853, comprised of cash of 615, accounts receivable of 81, current portion
of net investments in leases of 39 and prepaid expenses and other current assets of 113, which was offset by 1,448 of accounts payable
and accrued expenses, accrued dividends on preferred stock issuances of 108 and of current portion of lease liability of 145. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 4,284 of cash in operating activities and nil of cash in investing activities. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 (000 s) 

Cash
provided by financing activities totaled 4,709, comprised of proceeds from the sale of our common stock and warrants, net of expenses,
of 4,209 and proceeds from issuance of a related party note of 500. 

In
the comparable period in 2023, our aggregate cash provided by financing activities totaled 14,585 comprised of proceeds from the sale
of our common stock and warrants. At September 30, 2024, we had cash of 615 compared to 389 at September 30, 2023. Our cash is held
in bank deposit accounts. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no convertible debentures outstanding. 

Cash
used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4,284 and 14,371, respectively, which represent cash outlays
for research and development and general and administrative expenses in such periods. The decreases in cash outlays principally resulted
in reduced operating costs, general and administrative expenses in 2024 and with net decreases in our operating assets of 114 and a net
increase in our operating liabilities of 5,242. 

We
used nil cash for investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 182 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. For the comparable period, we purchased computers and other equipment. 

We
had an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 of 254.24 million, as well as a net loss attributable to BioSig of 9.2 million
and negative operating cash flows. We expect to continue incurring losses and negative cash flows from operations until our products
(primarily PURE EP Platform) reach full commercial profitability. 

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is an
issue raised due to our net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and our expectation is that these conditions
will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we will require additional financing to fund future operations. Although we have
commercial products available for sale, we have not generated significant revenues to date, and there is no assurance that we will be
able to generate cash flow to fund operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that our research and development will be successfully
completed or that any additional products will be approved or commercially viable. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject
to our ability to obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities,
obtaining loans from various financial institutions or being awarded grants from government agencies, where possible. Our continued net
operating losses increase the difficulty in meeting such goals and there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.
Additionally, with our reduction in staff, our planned commercialization may be further delayed. 

Our
plans include the continued commercialization of the PURE EP System and other applications of our core technology and raising capital
through the sale of additional equity securities, debt or capital inflows from strategic partnerships. Our shift from a focus on technology
development to commercialization has allowed us to reduce our annual expenses in a meaningful way. As a result of this transition, we
have been able to achieve savings through reductions in executive and management compensation and a reduction of our utilization of external
consultants and professional service providers. We believe these cost-saving measures combined with our expectations of positive trends
in commercial activity create the potential for us to achieve a lower cash flow breakeven rate. There are no assurances, however, that
we will be successful in obtaining the level of financing needed for our operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted and continues
to result in significant financial market volatility and uncertainty in recent months. In addition, U.S. and global markets are experiencing
volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the start of the military conflict between Russia and
Ukraine. 

35 

A
continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our
ability to access capital and on the market price of our common stock, and we may not be able to successfully raise capital through the
sale of our securities. 

Our
Series C Preferred Stock contains triggering events which would, among other things, require redemption (i) in cash, at the greater of
(a) 120 of the stated value of 1 or (b) the product of (I) the variable weighted average price of our common stock on the trading day
immediately preceding the date of the triggering event and (II) the stated value divided by the then conversion price or (ii) in shares
of our common stock, equal to a number of shares equal to the amount set forth in (i) above divided by 75 . As of September 30, 2024, the
aggregate stated value of our Series C Preferred Stock was 105. The triggering events include our being subject to a judgment of greater
than 100 or our initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. If any of the triggering events contained in our Series C Preferred Stock occur,
the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock may demand redemption, an obligation we may not have the ability to meet at the time of such
demand. We will be required to pay interest on any amounts remaining unpaid after the required redemption of our Series C Preferred Stock,
at a rate equal to the lesser of 18 per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. 

We
expect to incur losses from operations for the near future. We expect to incur additional marketing and commercialization expenses related
to our PURE EP system in addition to additional research and development costs relating to the PURE EP and other product candidates,
including expenses related to clinical trials. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as
we expand our business development, add infrastructure and incur additional costs related to being a public company, including incremental
audit fees, investor relations programs and increased professional services. 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the progress of our research and development of product candidates,
the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing
patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing and our success
in developing markets for our product candidates. 

Future
financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. Even if
we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses or experience unexpected cash
requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, existing
holders of our securities may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges
senior to those of existing holders of our securities. 

If
additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate
our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners
or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize
independently.

a concurrent private placement, common stock purchase warrants (the Private Placement Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate
of 1,570,683 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of 1.78 per share of Common Stock. 

36 

On
May 30, 2024, the Company closed the registered direct offering and the concurrent private placement (collectively, the Offering ),
raising gross proceeds of approximately 3.0 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the
Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Issuance
of Debt 

On
March 7, 2024, we issued a promissory note to an investor and an affiliate (10 or more shareholder) for 500,000. We designated its
12 note due 2026, in accordance with exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
Act ). 

The
note is due March 7, 2026. We promise to pay interest in cash on the unpaid principal amount of this note at a rate per annum equal to
twelve percent (12 ), commencing to accrue on the date hereof and payable on the maturity date or earlier prepayment as provided therein.
The Note contains customary events of default. 

We
may prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of the Note at any time or from time to time without penalty. 

On
May 1, 2024, we converted the promissory note and related accrued interest of 509,165 into 348,624 shares of common stock and warrants
to purchase 174,312 shares of common stock at 1.398 per share, that will become exercisable six months after the date of issuance and
will expire five and one-half years following the date of issuance. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include estimates based on
currently available information and our judgment as to the outcome of future conditions and circumstances. 

We
believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
financial statements. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on our historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Among the significant judgments made by management
in the preparation of our financial statements are the following: 

Stock
Based Compensation 

We
estimate the fair value of options and stock warrants granted using the Black Scholes Merton model. We estimate when and if performance-based
awards will be earned. If an award is not considered probable of being earned, no amount of equity-based compensation expense is recognized.
If the award is deemed probable of being earned, related equity-based compensation expense is recorded. The fair value of an award ultimately
expected to vest is recognized as an expense, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service periods in our statements of operations,
which is generally the vesting period of the award. 

The
Black Scholes Merton model requires the input of certain subjective assumptions and the application of judgment in determining the fair
value of the awards. The most significant assumptions and judgments include the expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, the expected
dividend yield, and the expected term of the awards. In addition, the recognition of equity-based compensation expense is impacted by
our forfeitures, which are accounted for as they occur. 

The
assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management s best estimates. If factors change and different assumptions
are used, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The assumptions used in our option pricing
model represent management s best estimates. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our equity-based compensation
expense could be materially different in the future. 

37 

All
stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors consisted of grants of restricted stock
and stock options, which are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the statements of operations as compensation
expense over the relevant vesting period. Restricted stock payments and stock-based payments to non-employees are recognized as an expense
over the period of performance. 

Such
payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached, or the date performance is completed.
In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are non-forfeitable, the measurement date is the date the award is issued.

Not
required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s
evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls
and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based
on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are not effective in providing reasonable assurance that information
we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
report on internal control over financial reporting. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company. Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the our board
of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those
policies and procedures that: 

(1) 
 pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
 assets of the company; 

(2) 
 provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made in accordance with authorizations
 of management and directors of the company; and 

(3) 
 provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily
applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible enhancements to controls and procedures. 

Management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the criteria in a framework developed by the Company s management pursuant
to and in compliance with the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls,
evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, walkthroughs of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this
evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as
of September 30, 2024, because management identified that i) inadequate identification, recording and reporting of stock based compensation,
ii) ineffective review processes over period end financial disclosure and reporting, and (iii) inadequate segregation of duties for transaction
posting and processing, amounted to a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

38 

The
material weaknesses did not result in any identified misstatements to the consolidated financial statements and there were no changes
to previously released financial results. 

Management s
Remediation Plan 

In
2025, we have intents to add sufficient staff and oversight supervision controls to provide adequate accounting segregation. We believe
these changes will remediate the underlying deficiencies as identified by us. The remediation efforts will include an ongoing review
of the implementation of additional controls to ensure all risks have been addressed. 

As
a result of the material weaknesses discussed above or of others, we may experience negative impacts on our ability to accurately report
our results of operation and financial condition in a timely manner. If we do identify a material weakness in our internal control over
financial reporting and are unsuccessful in implementing or following a remediation plan, or fail to update our internal control over
financial reporting as our business evolves or to integrate acquired businesses into our controls system, if additional material weaknesses
are found in our internal controls in the future, or if our external auditors cannot attest to the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial review, if applicable, we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition, results of operations
or cash flows or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to report financial information in a timely
and accurate manner or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory
or enforcement actions by the SEC, an inability for us to be accepted for listing on any national securities exchange in the near future,
securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and the
market value of our common stock. Further, there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of controls and procedures,
including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. We could face additional
litigation exposure and a greater likelihood of an SEC enforcement or other regulatory action if further restatements were to occur or
other accounting-related problems emerge. 

The
weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has
concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation referred to above that
occurred during our last completed fiscal quarter that has materially negatively affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. As discussed above, management has remediation plans that will be implemented in 2025.

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On
December 4, 2023, we received a threat of litigation for the termination of employment with the Company alleging the termination of employment
was in retaliation for bringing to the attention of the Company s board of directors and executives a series of wrongful and questionable
practices by members of the Company s board of directors, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The claimant sought
compensation of in the amount of 775,782. After an investigation conducted by the Board and guidance of legal counsel, it was concluded
that the claim was without merit. 

On
February 22, 2024, we received a threat of litigation seeking restitution for losses resulting from unlawful actions taken by the Company s
board of directors. The claimant contends that he and others have sustained losses totaling 1,440,000. On March 22, 2024, the claimant
sent another letter to the Company referencing the previous letter and requesting several documents. The Company believes that these
claims are without merit. 

On
March 22, 2024, plaintiff, Michael Gray Fleming (the Plaintiff ), filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County, Minnesota District
Court naming the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer as defendants. The Plaintiff contends
that the Company failed to meet its obligations in issuing the Plaintiff stock certificates under the terms of a restricted stock award
agreement. Plaintiff is seeking at least 288,000 in damages. The Company believes Plaintiff s allegations are baseless, and its
intent is to contest the allegations vigorously. As of the date of this report, the Company is unable to provide an evaluation of the
outcome of the litigation or to provide an estimate of the amount of or a range of potential loss that might be incurred by the Company.
The Company has moved to dismiss Plaintiff s claims; a hearing is set in September 2024. The Company also has learned that, following
expiration of the SEC Rule 144 waiting period for affiliate/control shares, Plaintiff was able to have his restrictions removed. In light
of the pending motion and legend removal, the Company hopes that Plaintiff will simply withdraw his complaint. 

We
may be subject at times to other legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of its business. Although occasional
adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters should not have a material
adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

There
are no material proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates or any registered or beneficial shareholder of more
than 5 of our common stock is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

The
following description of risk factors includes any material changes to risk factors associated with our business, financial condition
and results of operations previously disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. Our business, financial condition and operating results can be
affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more
of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from
anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price. 

The
following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other
statements in this Form 10-Q. The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements
and related notes in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements and Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-Q. 

Our
common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which
makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock. 

Rule
15g-9 under the Exchange Act, establishes the definition of a penny stock, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity
security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain
exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person s
account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction,
setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. 

In
order to approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information
and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are
suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the
risks of transactions in penny stocks. 

The
broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to
the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination;
and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally,
brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more
difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock. 

Disclosure
also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions
payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies
available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent
price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.
