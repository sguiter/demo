U.S. Federal Income Taxes The Company has elected to be treated, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and to operate in a manner to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, among other things, the Company is required to timely distribute to its shareholders at least 90 of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its shareholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned by the Company represents obligations of the Company s investors and will not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. To avoid a 4 U.S federal excise tax on undistributed earnings, the Company is required to distribute each calendar year the sum of (i) 98 of its ordinary income for such calendar year, (ii) 98.2 of its net capital gains for the one-year period ending December 31, and (iii) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which the Company paid no federal income tax or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. For this purpose, however, any net ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year will be considered to have been distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). The Company, at its discretion, may choose not to distribute all its taxable income for the calendar year and pay a non-

Table of Contents STELLUS PRIVATE CREDIT BDC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2024 (unaudited) 
 of undistributed taxable income that was carried forward toward distributions to be paid in 2024. All of the undistributed ordinary income as of December 31, 2023 will have been distributed within the required period of time such that the Company will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax related to the year ended December 31, 2023. Current income tax expense estimates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of and , respectively, is related to federal excise taxes. Current income tax expense estimates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of and , respectively, is related to federal excise taxes. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken while preparing its tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the applicable period. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not recorded a liability for any uncertain tax positions. Management s evaluation of uncertain tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company s policy is to include interest and penalties related to income taxes, if applicable, in general and administrative expenses. There were such expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Taxable Subsidiary is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that has elected to be a taxable entity. The Taxable Subsidiary permits the Company to hold equity investments in portfolio companies that are pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and continue to comply with the source-of-income requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated with the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Taxable Subsidiary uses the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses. Taxable income generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded deferred income tax (provision) of and related to the Taxable Subsidiary, respectively. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded deferred income tax provision of related to the Taxable Subsidiary. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a deferred tax liability of and , respectively.

 that we in the future may file with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Overview We were organized as a Delaware statutory trust on December 7, 2021, and formally commenced operations on February 1, 2022. Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our shareholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments in middle-market companies. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). Our investment activities are managed by our Advisor, Stellus Private BDC Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that is an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act ). The Advisor is a majority-owned subsidiary of Stellus Capital, which is also an investment adviser registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, as a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies (as defined in the 1940 Act). Under the relevant SEC rules, the term eligible portfolio company includes all private operating companies, operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public operating companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than 250.0 million, in each case organized and with their principal of business in the United States. We have elected, qualify, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated for tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the RIC requirements. So long as we maintain our status as a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our shareholders as dividends. In accordance with the 1940 Act, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total borrowings and other senior securities (and any preferred stock that we may issue in the future) of at least 150 , subject to meeting certain conditions. If this ratio declines below 150 , we cannot incur additional leverage and could be required to sell a portion of our investments to repay some leverage when it is disadvantageous to do so. The amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 220 and 210 , respectively. The amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. Economic Developments Economic activity has continued to accelerate across sectors and regions. Nonetheless, we have observed and may continue to observe supply chain interruptions, labor resource shortages, commodity inflation, rising interest rates, economic sanctions in response to international conflicts and instances of geopolitical, economic and financial market instability in the United States and abroad. One or more of these factors may contribute to increased market volatility and may have long- and short-term effects in the United States and worldwide financial markets.

 The weighted average yield on all of our debt investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately 11.5 and 12.5 , respectively. The weighted average yield on all of our investments, including non-income producing equity positions, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately 11.0 and 11.9 , respectively. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates for all of our debt investments, including accretion of original issue discount. The weighted average yield of our investments is not the same as a return on investment for our shareholder, but rather relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of our subsidiary s fees and expenses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 3.5 million and 0.6 million, respectively. Investment Activity During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made an aggregate of 67.0 million of investments in 12 new portfolio companies and five existing portfolio companies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received an aggregate of 19.6 million in proceeds from repayments of our investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made an aggregate of 68.5 million of investments in 17 new portfolio companies and five existing portfolio companies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received an aggregate of 17.4 million in proceeds from repayments of our investments. Our level of investment activity can vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. Asset Quality In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, the Advisor uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. This investment rating system uses a five-level numeric scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment category: Investment Category 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. Investment Category 2 is used for investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans are initially rated 2. Investment Category 3 is used for investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants. Investment Category 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in work out. Investments with a rating of 4 are those for which some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected. Investment Category 5 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in work out. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected.

As September 30, 2024, we had loans to one portfolio company that was on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 1.9 of our loan portfolio at cost and 1.4 at fair value. As of September 30, 2024, less than 0.1 million of income from investments on non-accrual had not been accrued. As of December 31, 2023, zero loans were on non-accrual status. Results of Operations An important measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gain (loss) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. Comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenues We generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to seven years and bear interest at a floating rate. Interest on our debt securities is generally payable quarterly. Payments of principal on our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments may pay interest in-kind PIK interest. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. The level of interest income we receive is directly related to the balance of interest-bearing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect that the total dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn will increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, loan origination, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and consulting fees. The following shows the breakdown of investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions).

 (1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized less than 0.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively, of non-recurring income related to early repayments to specific loan positions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we recognized less than 0.1 million and 0.4 million, respectively, of non-recurring income related to early repayments to specific loan positions. The increase in interest income from the respective periods was due primarily to growth in the overall investment portfolio.

Net Investment Income For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net investment income was 4.7 million, or 0.49 per common share of beneficial interest (based on 9,456,180 weighted-average common shares of beneficial interest outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024). For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net investment income was 3.1 million, or 0.47 per common share of beneficial interest (based on 6,584,179 weighted-average common shares of beneficial interest outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2023). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net investment income was 12.1 million, or 1.45 per common share of beneficial interest (based on 8,335,421 weighted-average common shares of beneficial interest outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024).

The increase in net investment income over the respective periods was due to higher investment income as a result of a larger investment portfolio and rising interest rates, offset by the increase in expenses as explained in the Expenses section above.

 Net Realized Gains and Losses We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment, sale or other disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. There were no realized gains on investments for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company realized less than 0.1 million of net realized gains related to foreign currency translations. Proceeds from repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 6.6 million and 19.6 million, respectively. Proceeds from repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 4.8 million and 17.4 million, respectively. Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. Net change in unrealized depreciation on investments and cash equivalents for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 0.4) million and 0.5) million, respectively. Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments and cash equivalents for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 1.0 million and 2.8 million, respectively. (Provision) Benefit for Taxes on Unrealized (Appreciation) Depreciation on Investments PBDC Consolidated Blocker, LLC (the Taxable Subsidiary permits us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies, which are pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and continue to comply with the source income requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated with us for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a (provision) for income tax on unrealized investments of less than 0.1) million for the Taxable Subsidiary. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a provision for income tax on unrealized investments of 0.1) million. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was 0.2 million of deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled 4.2 million, or 0.45 per common share of beneficial interest (based on 9,456,180 weighted-average common shares of beneficial interest outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024). For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled 4.1 million, or 0.62 per common share of beneficial interest (based on 6,584,179 weighted-average common shares of beneficial interest outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2023). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled 11.6 million, or 1.39 per common share of beneficial interest (based on 8,335,421 weighted-average common shares of beneficial interest outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024).

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled 11.2 million, or 1.85 per common share of beneficial interest (based on 6,044,958 weighted-average common shares of beneficial interest outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2023). Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources Cash Flows from Operating and Financing Activities Our operating activities used net cash of 35.7 million and 42.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily in connection with the purchase of new portfolio investments. Our financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 provided cash of 38.6 million primarily from the issuance of common shares of beneficial interest. Our financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 provided cash of 28.2 million primarily from net borrowings on our Credit Facilities and the issuance of common shares of beneficial interest, offset by short term loan repayments. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity and capital resources are derived from net proceeds of any share offering, pursuant to capital calls from investors with capital commitments to us, the Credit Facility, and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and other operating expenses we incur, as well as the payment of dividends to the holders of our common shares of beneficial interest. We used, and expect to continue to use, these capital resources as well as proceeds from turnover within our portfolio and from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment activities. In addition, we intend to distribute between 90 and 100 of our taxable income to our shareholders in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code. Consequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments, to make additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings. In addition, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value. Also, as a BDC, we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, over the aggregate amount of the senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock, of at least 150 , subject to meeting certain conditions. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. We were in compliance with the asset coverage ratios at all times. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 220 and 210 , respectively. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of common shares of beneficial interest and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 3.5 million and 0.6 million, respectively. Credit Facilities Commitment Facility On February 1, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit and security agreement with Signature Bank (as amended, the Commitment Facility ). All amounts borrowed under the Commitment Facility matured on December 31, 2023, and all principal, accrued and unpaid interest thereunder was paid on December 22, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, no prepaid loan structure fees had yet to be amortized.

Any amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on September 30, 2027. Our obligations to the lenders under the Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in its portfolio of securities and cash held. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including but not limited to: (i) maintaining a minimum liquidity test of at least 10.0 million, including cash, liquid investments, and undrawn availability, (ii) maintaining an asset coverage ratio of at least 1.67 to 1.00, (iii) maintaining a certain minimum stockholder s equity, and (iv) maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of 42.7 million and 49.3 million, respectively, of unfunded commitments to provide debt and equity financings to 38 and 31 of our portfolio companies, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had sufficient liquidity to fund such unfunded commitments (through cash on hand, its ability to drawdown capital from investors, and/or available borrowings under the Credit Facilities) should the need arise. Regulated Investment Company Status and Dividends We have elected, qualify and intend to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. So long as we continue to qualify as a RIC, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed, or deemed to be distributed, to shareholders as dividends on a timely basis. Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized. Distributions declared and paid by us in a year may differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income or the distribution of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the current year. Distributions also may include returns of capital. To qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute, with respect to each taxable year, at least 90 of our investment company net taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any). If we qualify as a RIC, we must also satisfy certain distribution requirements each calendar year in order to avoid a federal excise tax on our undistributed earnings of a RIC. As of December 31, 2023, the Company estimates that it has 1.5 million of undistributed taxable income that was carried forward toward distributions to be paid in 2024. All of the undistributed ordinary income as of December 31, 2023 will have been distributed within the required period of time such that the Company will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax related to the year ended December 31, 2023.

 We intend to distribute to our shareholders between 90 and 100 of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income). However, the covenants contained in the Credit Facilities may prohibit us from making distributions to our shareholders, and, as a result, could hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net taxable capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our shareholders. If we do this, our shareholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our Common Shares. Our shareholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of our dividends for that fiscal year, a portion of those dividend distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our shareholders. We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in Credit Facilities. We cannot assure shareholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level. In accordance with certain applicable U.S. Treasury regulations and private letter rulings issued by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ), a publicly offered RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each shareholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all shareholders must be at least 20 of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many shareholders elect to receive cash, each shareholder electing to receive cash must receive a pro rata amount of cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any shareholder electing to receive cash, receive less than 20 of his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these U.S. Treasury regulations or private letter rulings. However, we continue to monitor our liquidity position and the overall economy and will continue to assess whether it would be in our and our shareholders best interest to take advantage of the IRS rulings.

As of November 8, 2024, the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility and SPV Facility was 74.8 million and 50.0 million, respectively. Dividends Declared On October 10, the Board declared a regular monthly dividend for each of October 2024, November 2024, and December 2024 as follows: 

Record Payment Amount per Declared Date Date Share 10/10/2024 10/10/2024 10/31/2024 0.1600 10/10/2024 11/1/2024 11/29/2024 0.1600 10/10/2024 12/2/2024 12/31/2024 0.1600 Sale of Unregistered Securities Since September 30, 2024, the Company sold 19,735 common shares of beneficial interest at a price of 15.14 per share for aggregate proceeds of 298,791 which included 1,814 of organizational expense allocation pursuant to subscription agreements entered into between the Company and investors. Additionally, on October 16, 2024, the Company called 150,000 pursuant to capital draw down subscription agreements between the Company and its shareholders. The transaction closed on October 30, 2024, and resulted in the issuance of 9,868 common shares of beneficial interest at a price of 15.14 per share. Since September 30, 2024, the Company also issued 10,747 common shares of beneficial interest for aggregate proceeds of 0.2 million under the dividend reinvestment plan (the DRIP ). Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. In September 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates for the first time since March 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing the target for the federal funds rate down to 4.75 - 5.0 from 5.25 - 5.50 . As of September 30,

Table of Contents 
 2024 and December 31, 2023, 91 and 96 of the loans in our portfolio bore interest at floating rates, respectively. These floating rate loans typically bear interest in reference to SOFR, which is indexed to 30-day or 90-day SOFR rate, subject to interest rate floors. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average interest rate floor on our floating rate loans was 1.45 . Assuming that the Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024 was to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of changes in interest rates: 

in millions) Change in Basis Points (2) Interest Income Interest Expense (3) Net Interest Income (1) Up 200 basis points 4.4 (2.4) 2.0 Up 150 basis points 3.3 (1.8) 1.5 Up 100 basis points 2.2 (1.2) 1.0 Up 50 basis points 1.1 (0.6) 0.5 Down 50 basis points (1.1) 0.6 (0.5) Down 100 basis points (2.2) 1.2 (1.0) Down 150 basis points (3.3) 1.8 (1.5) Down 200 basis points (4.4) 2.4 (2.0) 

 (1) Excludes the impact of incentive fees based on pre-incentive fee net investment income. See Note 2 for more information on the incentive fee. (2) As of September 30, 2024, the three month three month SOFR rate was 459 basis points. This table assumes floating rates would not fall below zero. (3) Includes the impact of 25 bps SOFR floor pursuant to the Credit Facility agreement. Although we believe that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size, and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business or economic developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate. We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options, and forward contacts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not engage in hedging activities. Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of various members of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company s management did not identify any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
