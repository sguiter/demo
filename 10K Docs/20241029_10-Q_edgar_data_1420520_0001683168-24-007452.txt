million and working capital of approximately 
million . The Company has generated only limited revenues since inception and has incurred recurring operating losses. Accordingly, it
is subject to all the risks inherent in the initial organization, financing, expenditures, and scaling of a new business that is not generating
positive cashflow. 

On May 31, 2022, Atomera entered
into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Oppenheimer Co. Inc. and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, as agents, under which the Company
may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its 0.001 par value common stock in at the market 
offerings to or through the agents, having aggregate offering proceeds of up to 50.0 million (the ATM ). During the three-month
period ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold approximately shares pursuant to the ATM at an average price per share of approximately
 , resulting in approximately million of net proceeds to the Company after deducting commissions and other offering expenses.
During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold approximately million shares pursuant to the ATM at an average
price per share of approximately , resulting in approximately million of net proceeds to the Company after deducting commissions
and other offering expenses. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a remaining capacity on the ATM of approximately million . 

Based on the funds it has
available as of the date of the filing of this report, the Company believes that it has sufficient capital to fund its current business
plans and obligations over, at least, 12 months from the date that these financial statements have been issued. The Company s future
capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors, including the Company s ability to successfully
commercialize its technology, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies
or acquire technologies to enhance or complement its current offerings. 

The Company s cash equivalents
and short-term investments were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 1 assets.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion
and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Atomera Incorporated should be read in conjunction with our financial
statements and the accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Statements in this Quarterly Report
include forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives,
expectations and intentions. We use words such as anticipate, estimate, plan, project, 
 continuing, ongoing, expect, believe, intend, may, 
 will, should, could, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Although
forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based
on facts and factors currently known by us. Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and
changes in condition, significance, value and effect, including those risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024. Such risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance,
value and effect could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed herein and in ways not readily foreseeable.
Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report
and are based on information currently and reasonably known to us. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking
statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this Quarterly Report. Readers are urged to
carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this Quarterly Report, which attempt to advise interested parties of the
risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

Overview 

We are engaged in the business
of developing, commercializing and licensing proprietary processes and technologies for the 550+ billion semiconductor industry. Our
lead technology, named Mears Silicon Technology , or MST , is a thin film of reengineered silicon, typically 100
to 300 angstroms (or approximately 20 to 60 silicon atomic unit cells) thick. MST can be applied as a transistor channel enhancement to
CMOS-type transistors, the most widely used transistor type in the semiconductor industry. MST is our proprietary and patent-protected
performance enhancement technology that we believe addresses a number of key engineering challenges facing the semiconductor industry.
We believe that by incorporating MST, transistors can be made smaller, with increased speed, reliability and power efficiency. In addition,
since MST is an additive and low-cost technology, we believe it can be deployed on an industrial scale, with equipment commonly used in
semiconductor manufacturing. We believe that MST can be widely incorporated into the most common types of semiconductor products, including
analog, logic, memory and optical integrated circuits. 

We do not intend to design
or manufacture integrated circuits directly. Instead, we develop and license technologies and processes that we believe offer the designers
and manufacturers of integrated circuits a low-cost solution to the industry s need for greater performance and lower power consumption.
Our customers and partners include: 

foundries, which manufacture integrated circuits on behalf of fabless manufacturers; 

integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, which are the fully-integrated designers and manufacturers of integrated circuits; 

fabless semiconductor manufacturers, which are designers of integrated circuits that outsource the manufacturing of their chips to foundries; 

original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, that manufacture the epitaxial, or epi, equipment used to deposit semiconductor layers, such as the MST film, onto silicon wafers; and 

electronic design automation companies, which make tools used throughout the industry to simulate performance of semiconductor products using different materials, design structures and process technologies. 

Our commercialization strategy
is to generate revenue through licensing arrangements whereby foundries, IDMs and fabless semiconductor manufacturers pay us a license
fee for their right to use MST technology in the manufacture of silicon wafers as well as a royalty for each silicon wafer or device that
incorporates our MST technology. We also license our MSTcad (R) software to our customers for use in simulating the effects
of using MST technology on their wafers and/or devices. To date, we have generated revenue from (i) licensing agreements with two IDMs,
one fabless manufacturer and one foundry, (ii) a joint development agreement, or JDA, with a leading semiconductor provider, (iii) engineering
services provided to foundries, IDMs and fabless companies and (iv) licensing MSTcad. 

15 

In April 2023, we entered
into a license agreement with ST Microelectronics ST that authorizes ST to manufacture and distribute MST-enabled products
to its customers. This agreement provides for payment of license fees payable upon reaching milestones consistent with Atomera s
standard business model. Our standard model is based around two major milestones, namely the installation of MST in a customer s
fab and qualification of an MST-enabled process. Our license agreement with ST is our first grant of commercial manufacturing and distribution
rights. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed the first major milestone under the ST license agreement by delivering our MST film
recipe and ST accepting the film, resulting in our recognizing license revenue associated with that milestone. ST is currently performing
testing to optimize their integration of MST as part of their qualification process. Upon qualification, we will earn additional license
fees for the distribution license, after which ST will be entitled to MST-enabled products and royalties will be payable to us for every
product sold. There can be no assurance, however, that ST will complete its process qualification and pursue the licensed rights through
development to the manufacture and commercial sale of MST-enabled products. 

We were organized as a Delaware
limited liability company under the name Nanovis LLC on November 26, 2001. On March 13, 2007, we converted to a Delaware corporation under
the name Mears Technologies, Inc. On January 12, 2016, we changed our name to Atomera Incorporated. 

On May 31, 2022, we entered
into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Oppenheimer Co. Inc and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, as agents, under which we may
offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0
million in an at-the-market offering or ATM , to or through the agents. During the three-month period ended
September 30, 2024, we sold approximately 691,000 shares pursuant to the ATM at an average price per share of approximately 3.18, resulting
in approximately 2.1 million of net proceeds to the Company after deducting commissions and other offering expenses. During the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024, we sold approximately 1.9 million shares pursuant to the ATM at an average price per share of approximately
 4.74, resulting in approximately 8.5 million of net proceeds to the Company after deducting commissions and other offering expenses. 

Results of Operations 

Revenues . To date,
we have only generated limited revenue from customer engagements for engineering services, integration license agreements, a manufacturing
license granted under a JDA, our license agreement with ST and licensing of MSTcad. Our license agreement with ST, which was executed
in April 2023, is our first commercial manufacturing and distribution agreement and, assuming successful completion of contractual milestones
and payments of associated fees, will entitle us to royalties on all MST-enabled products manufactured for commercial purposes. Our MSTcad
licenses grant customers the right to use MSTcad software to simulate the effects of incorporating MST technology into their semiconductor
manufacturing process. MSTcad licenses are granted on a monthly or yearly basis and revenue is recognized over time. 

Revenue for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 22,000 and 112,000 respectively. Our revenue in 2024 consisted of MSTcad licensing
and related consulting services revenue, and engineering services revenue from the delivery of MST wafers. Revenue was not recorded during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cost of revenue . Cost
of revenue consists of costs of materials, as well as direct compensation and expenses incurred to provide deliverables that result in
payment of success fees, delivery of wafers delivered as part of integration license agreements and consulting services provided for our
MSTcad licenses. Cost of revenue is expensed when incurred and may not correspond with revenue earned. Cost of revenue for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 3,000 and 110,000, respectively. We anticipate that our cost of revenue will
vary substantially depending on the mix of license and engineering services revenues we receive and the nature of products and/or services
delivered in each customer engagement. Cost of revenue was not recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Operating expenses. 
Operating expenses consist of research and development, general and administrative, and selling and marketing expenses. For the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating expenses totaled approximately 4.8 million and 5.4 million, respectively. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating expenses totaled approximately 14.5 million and 15.9 million, respectively. 

16 

Research and development
expense . To date, our operations have focused on the research, development, patent prosecution, and commercialization of our MST technology
and related technologies such as MSTcad. Our research and development costs primarily consist of payroll and benefits costs for our engineering
staff and costs of outsourced fabrication (including epi tool leases) and metrology of semiconductor wafers incorporating our MST technology. 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred approximately 2.8 million and 3.3 million, respectively, of research and development expenses,
a decrease of approximately 546,000, or 17 . This decrease was primarily due to decrease of approximately 540,000 in outsourced research
and development as our foundry services provider, TSI Semiconductor, ceased providing these services as of January 31, 2024 after it was
acquired by Robert Bosch LLC. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred approximately 8.2 million and 9.5 million, respectively, of research and development expenses,
a decrease of approximately 1.3 million, or 14 . This decrease was primarily due to a decline of approximately 1.4 million in outsourced
research and development as we discontinued working with TSI Semiconductor as of January 31, 2024. 

General and administrative
expense. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefit costs for administrative personnel, office-related
costs and professional fees. General and administrative costs were approximately 1.8 million and 1.7 million for the three-month periods
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing an increase of approximately 129,000, or 8 . The increase is primarily
related to increases of approximately 108,000 in employee costs and approximately 67,000 in legal costs and fees related to our patent
portfolio. These costs are partially offset by a decrease of approximately 82,000 in stock-based compensation costs. 

General and administrative
costs were approximately 5.5 million and 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing
an increase of approximately 255,000, or 5 . The increase is primarily related to increases of approximately 207,000 in payroll and
benefits costs and approximately 226,000 in legal costs and fees related to our patent portfolio. These increases were partly offset
by decreases of approximately 85,000 in corporate legal expenses and approximately 69,000 in stock-based compensation expense. 

Selling and marketing expense. 
Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for our sales and marketing personnel and business development
consulting services. Selling and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 248,000
and 365,000, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately 117,000, or 32 . Selling and marketing expenses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 805,000 and 1.1 million, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately
 342,000, or 30 . The decrease in costs for both the three and nine month periods is primarily due to a reduction in headcount. 

Interest income. Interest
income for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 176,000 and 177,000, respectively. Interest income for nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 566,000 and 528,000, respectively. Interest income for the periods presented
reflected interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 

Accretion income. Accretion
income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 59,000 and 112,000, respectively. Accretion income for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 152,000 and 221,000, respectively. Accretion income relates to the
increase in value of our available-for-sale securities from the purchase date through the maturity date. 

Interest expense. Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 30,000 and 47,000, respectively. Interest expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 104,000 and 151,000, respectively. Interest expense is related to
the tool financing lease entered into in August 2021. 

Other income, net. Other
income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 0 and 72,000, consisted of a refundable state research
and development tax credit, net of filing costs and tax consulting services received in the second quarter of 2024. Other income for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of approximately 72,000 also consisted of a refundable state research and development
tax credit, net of filing costs and tax consulting services received in the third quarter of 2023.

Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing
Activities 

Net cash used in operating
activities of approximately 10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from our net loss of approximately
 13.8 million offset by approximately 2.9 million of stock-based compensation and the amortization of our right of use assets of approximately
 1.0 million offset by increases in our payroll-related accruals. 

Net cash used in operating
activities of approximately 11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from our net loss of approximately
 15.2 million offset by approximately 3.0 million of stock-based compensation and approximately 1.0 million of amortization of right-of-use
assets. 

Net cash provided by investing
activities of approximately 3.5 million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of the maturity of short-term
available-for-sale investments, offset by the purchase of short-term available-for-sale investments. 

Net cash used in investing
activities of approximately 7.6 million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of the purchase of short-term
available-for-sale investments, offset by the maturity of short-term available-for-sale investments 

Net cash provided by financing
activities of approximately 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to the net proceeds from our ATM
offering, offset by the principal payments on our financing lease. 

Net cash provided by financing
activities of approximately 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to the net proceeds from our
ATM offering, offset by the principal payments on our financing lease. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 13.8 million, short-term investments of approximately 3.6 million and working capital
of approximately 14.4 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of approximately 13.8 million and used
approximately 10.2 million of cash and cash equivalents in operations. Since inception, we have incurred recurring operating losses. 

During the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024, we sold approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM at an average price per share of
approximately 4.74, resulting in approximately 8.5 million of net proceeds to the Company after deducting commissions and other offering
expenses. Since September 30, 2024, we sold approximately 489,000 additional shares through the ATM offering at an average price
per share of 3.27 resulting in additional net proceeds of approximately 1.6 million. 

We believe that our available
working capital is sufficient to fund our presently forecasted working capital requirements for, at least, the next 12 months following
the date of the filing of this report. However, our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on
many factors, including our ability to successfully commercialize our MST technology, competing technological and market developments,
and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire technologies to enhance or complement our current offerings.
If we are not able to generate sufficient revenue from license fees and royalties in a timeframe that satisfies our cash needs, we will
need to raise more capital. In the event we require additional capital, we will endeavor to acquire additional funds through various financing
sources, including our ATM, follow-on equity offerings, debt financing and joint ventures with industry partners. In addition, we will
consider alternatives to our current business plan that may enable us to achieve revenue-producing operations and meaningful commercial
success with a smaller amount of capital. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to curtail our research and
development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve cash.
