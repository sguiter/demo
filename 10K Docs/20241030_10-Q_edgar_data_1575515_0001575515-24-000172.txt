 Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in the impairment analysis of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets. 
 The Company did t have any financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 29, 2024. 
 Total financial liabilities 
 The determination of fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets for purposes of the Company s goodwill or long-lived asset impairment evaluation is based upon Level 3 inputs. When necessary, the Company uses third party market data and market participant assumptions to derive the fair value of its asset groupings, which primarily include right-of-use lease assets and property and equipment. 
 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and accrued salaries and benefits approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. Based on comparable open market transactions, the fair value of the long-term debt approximated carrying value as of December 31, 2023.

 stores located in California operating under the Sprouts Farmers Market name pursuant to a legacy trademark license arrangement. The aggregate consideration paid in the transaction consisted of million of the Company s common shares valued at million using the closing price of the Company's common stock on March 20, 2023 and cash consideration of million. 
 The Company accounted for this transaction as a business combination in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs were immaterial and were expensed as incurred. The financial results of the acquired stores have been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The acquired stores' results of operations were not material to the Company's consolidated results. 
 The net purchase price was allocated to the net tangible assets of million and a reacquired right intangible asset of million based on their fair values on the acquisition date. The remaining unallocated net purchase price of million was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits to the Company from the acquisition, which include the Company's ability to fully control the Sprouts Farmers Market brand by termination of the legacy trademark license agreement and allowing further expansion opportunities in Southern California. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The final allocation of the purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been completed and included an immaterial amount of measurement period adjustments.

Sprouts inspires wellness naturally with a carefully curated assortment of better-for-you products paired with purpose-driven people. We continue to bring the latest in wholesome, innovative products made with lifestyle-friendly ingredients such as organic, plant-based and gluten-free.

 Our Growth Strategy 
 We continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy that we believe is transforming our company and driving profitable growth, focusing on the following areas: 
 Win with Target Customers . We are focusing attention on our target customers, identified through research as health enthusiasts and selective shoppers , where there is ample opportunity to gain share within these customer segments. We believe our business can continue to grow by leveraging existing strengths in a unique assortment of better-for-you, quality products and by providing a full omnichannel offering through delivery or pickup via our website or the Sprouts app. 
 Update Format and Expand in Select Markets . We are delivering unique smaller stores with expectations of stronger returns, while maintaining the approachable, fresh-focused farmer s market heritage Sprouts is known for. From 2021 through September 29, 2024, we opened 63 new stores and remodeled one store featuring our new format. Our geographic store expansion and new store placement will intersect where our target customers live, in markets with growth potential and supply chain support, which we believe will provide a long runway of approximately 10 annual unit growth. 
 Create an Advantaged Fresh Supply Chain . We believe our network of fresh distribution centers can drive efficiencies across the chain and support our growth plans. To further deliver on our fresh commitment and reputation, as well as to increase our local offerings and improve financial results, we aspire to ultimately position fresh distribution centers within a 250-mile radius of stores. Following the opening of two fresh distribution centers in fiscal 2021 and the relocation of our Southern California distribution center, closure of our Georgia distribution center and partnership with a third-party fresh distribution center in the Northeast in fiscal 2023, we are better leveraging our existing distribution center capacity, and approximately 80 of our stores were within 250 miles of a distribution center as of September 29, 2024. 
 Refine Brand and Marketing Approach . We believe we are elevating our national brand recognition and positioning by telling our unique brand story rooted in product innovation and differentiation. We are increasing our use of data analytics and insights. We believe this data-driven intelligence will increase customer engagement through personalization efforts with digital and social connections to drive additional sales growth and loyalty. 
 Inspire and Engage Our Talent to Create a Best Place to Work . Subsequent to the initial launch of our long-term growth strategy, we have added the focus area of inspiring and engaging our talent through our culture, acquisition and development and total rewards program to attract and retain the talent we believe we need to execute on our strategic goals and transform our company into a premier place to work.

 Return on Invested Capital 
 In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we provide information regarding Return on Invested Capital (referred to as ROIC as additional information about our operating results. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. ROIC is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital and provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. 
 We define ROIC as net operating profit after tax (referred to as NOPAT ), including the effect of capitalized operating leases, divided by average invested capital. Operating lease interest represents the add-back to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as a finance lease. The assumed ownership and associated interest expense are calculated using the discount rate for each lease as recorded as a component of rent expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. Invested capital reflects a trailing four-quarter average. 
 As numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC, our method may differ from methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC. It is important to understand the methods and the differences in those methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC before comparing our ROIC to that of other companies.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below, as well as our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of each period (in thousands): 
 Thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 311,725 253,849 Cash flows from operating activities 520,351 409,025 Cash flows used in investing activities (161,687) (178,048) Cash flows used in financing activities (250,809) (272,320)

Table of Contents 

 We have generally financed our operations principally through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash are for purchases of inventory, operating expenses, capital expenditures primarily for opening new stores, remodels and maintenance, repurchases of our common stock and debt service. Our principal contractual obligations and commitments consist of obligations under our Credit Agreement, interest on our Credit Agreement, operating and finance leases, purchase commitments and self-insurance liabilities. Our operating and finance leases for the rental of land, buildings, and for rental of facilities and equipment expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various dates through 2048. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, and cash anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including new store openings, remodel and maintenance capital expenditures at existing stores, store initiatives and other corporate capital expenditures and activities. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or, in the case of credit or debit card transactions, within days from the related sale. 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operating activities increased 111.4 million to 520.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 compared to 409.0 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for non-cash items of 91.6 million and favorable changes in working capital of 43.4 million, partially offset by higher payments on our operating lease liabilities of 18.9 million due to growth. 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities from changes in working capital were 114.2 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 compared to 70.8 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. This 43.4 million increase in cash flows from changes in working capital was primarily attributable to a 20.2 million change in accounts receivable driven by the timing of collections as well as 17.0 million change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, primarily due to timing differences of payments for goods and services. Certain other immaterial items combined to result in an additional 6.2 million net increase in cash flows from changes in working capital. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures in new stores, including leasehold improvements and store equipment, capital expenditures to maintain the appearance of our stores, sales enhancing initiatives and other corporate investments as well as cash outlays for acquisitions. Cash flows used in investing activities were 161.7 million and 178.0 million, for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, respectively. Cash flows used in investing activities during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 included our acquisition of Ronald Cohn, Inc. See Note 13, "Business Combination" of our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 205 - 215 million in 2024, including expenditures incurred to date, net of estimated landlord tenant improvement allowances, primarily to fund investments in new stores, remodels, maintenance capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures. We expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash on hand and cash generated from operating activities. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash flows used in financing activities were 250.8 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 compared to 272.3 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, cash flows used in financing activities primarily consisted of 125.0 million in payments on our Credit Agreement and 129.7 million for stock repurchases, partially offset by 4.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, cash flows used in financing activities primarily consisted of 180.4 million for stock repurchases and 100.0 million in payments on our Credit Agreement, partially offset by 8.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

 Share Repurchase Program 
 Our board of directors from time to time authorizes share repurchase programs for our common stock. The following table outlines the share repurchase program authorized by our board, and the related repurchase activity and available authorization as of September 29, 2024: 
 Effective date Expiration date Amount authorized Cost of repurchases Authorization available March 2, 2022 December 31, 2024 600,000 480,715 May 22, 2024 May 22, 2027 600,000 40,602 559,398 
 The shares under our current repurchase program may be purchased on a discretionary basis from time to time through the applicable expiration date, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. Our board s authorization of the share repurchase program does not obligate our Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be commenced, suspended, or discontinued at any time. 
 Share repurchase activity under our repurchase program for the periods indicated was as follows (total cost in thousands): 
 Thirteen weeks ended Thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Number of common shares acquired 264,135 831,416 1,861,453 5,307,759 Average price per common share acquired 96.60 38.89 70.22 34.28 Total cost of common shares acquired 25,516 32,333 130,708 181,974 
 Shares purchased under our repurchase programs were subsequently retired and the excess of the repurchase price over par value was charged to retained earnings. The cost of common shares repurchased included the 1 excise tax imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. 
 Subsequent to September 29, 2024 and through the date of this filing, we repurchased an additional 0.1 million shares of common stock for 5.6 million, excluding excise tax. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Our principal contractual obligations and commitments arising in the normal course of business consist of obligations under our Credit Agreement, interest on our Credit Agreement, operating and finance leases, purchase commitments and self-insurance liabilities. Except as otherwise disclosed in Note 4, Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities of our unaudited consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes outside the normal course of business as of September 29, 2024 in our contractual obligations and commitments from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 Impact of Inflation and Deflation 
 Inflation and deflation in the prices of food and other products we sell may periodically affect our sales, gross profit and gross margin. Food inflation, when combined with reduced consumer spending, could also reduce sales, gross profit margins and comparable store sales. Inflationary pressures on compensation, utilities, commodities, equipment and supplies may also impact our profitability. Food deflation or declining levels of inflation across multiple categories, particularly in produce, could reduce sales growth and earnings, particularly if our competitors react by lowering their retail pricing and expanding their promotional activities, which can lead to retail deflation higher than cost deflation that could reduce our sales, gross profit margins and comparable store sales. The short-term impact of inflation and deflation is largely dependent on whether or not the effects are passed through to our customers, which is subject to competitive market conditions. 
 Food inflation and deflation is affected by a variety of factors and our determination of whether to pass on the effects of inflation or deflation to our customers is made in conjunction with our overall pricing and marketing strategies, as well as our competitors responses. Although we may experience periodic effects on sales, gross profit, gross margins and cash flows as a result of changing prices, we do not expect the effect of inflation or deflation to have a material impact on our ability to execute our long-term business strategy. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our critical accounting estimates include inventories, lease assumptions, self-insurance reserves, goodwill and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. 
 There have been no substantial changes to these estimates, or the policies related to them during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. For a full discussion of these estimates and policies, see Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 As described in Note 4, Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities to our unaudited consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Credit Agreement bears interest at a rate based in part on SOFR. Accordingly, we could be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. As of September 29, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Table of Contents 

 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of September 29, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, product liability, personal injury, intellectual property and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, which have not resulted in any material losses to date. Although management does not expect that the outcome in these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, litigation is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could materially impact our results. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties referenced below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Any of those risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects and cause the value of our common stock to decline, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment. 
 There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described under Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
