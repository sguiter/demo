 billion and billion as of November 30, 2024 and August 31, 2024, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately of our remaining performance obligations as of November 30, 2024 as revenue in fiscal 2025, an additional in fiscal 2026, and the balance thereafter. 
 Contract Estimates

Deferred transition costs were and as of November 30, 2024 and August 31, 2024, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred transition costs are recoverable under the contract in the event of early termination and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.

 (1) This facility, which matures on May 14, 2029, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit and short-term commercial paper. Borrowings under this facility will accrue interest at the applicable risk-free rate plus a spread. We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. 
 (2) We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of November 30, 2024 and August 31, 2024 , we had borrowings under these facilities. 
 (3) We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of November 30, 2024 and August 31, 2024 , we had borrowings under these various facilities.

 and , respectively, of which all but approximately and , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. 
 As of November 30, 2024 and August 31, 2024, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of net of recourse provisions) and net of recourse provisions) respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote. 
 To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. 
 Legal Contingencies 
 As of November 30, 2024, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, except as otherwise noted below, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. Marriott in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. Starwood ), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On May 3, 2022, the court issued an order granting in part the plaintiffs motion for class certification, which we appealed. On August 17, 2023, the appeals court vacated the class certification and remanded the case to the district court for consideration of, among other things, the class action waiver signed by Starwood customer plaintiffs. On November 29, 2023, the district court reinstated the classes previously certified by the court in May 2022. We are appealing the district court s decision. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 After Accenture Federal Services AFS made a voluntary disclosure to the U.S. government, the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ initiated a civil and criminal investigation concerning whether one or more employees provided inaccurate submissions to an assessor who was evaluating on behalf of the U.S. government an AFS service offering and whether the service offering fully implemented required federal security controls. AFS is responding to an administrative subpoena and cooperating with DOJ s investigation. This matter could subject us to adverse consequences, including civil and criminal penalties, including under the civil U.S. False Claims Act and/or other statutes, and administrative sanctions, such as termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with agencies of the U.S. government. We cannot at this time determine when or how this matter will be resolved or estimate the cost or range of costs that are reasonably likely to be incurred in connection with this matter.

 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2024, and with the information under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2024. 
 We use the terms Accenture, we, our and us in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to fiscal 2025 means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2025. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. 
 We use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

Overview 
 Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: the Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific. We combine our strength in technology and leadership in cloud, data and AI with unmatched industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services creating tangible value at speed and scale. 
 Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business. These conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending, particularly for smaller contracts with a shorter duration and for our consulting services. Clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue over a longer period.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 24 

Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 9 in U.S. dollars and 8 in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in the Americas, strong in EMEA and solid in Asia Pacific. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Health Public Service and Products, strong in Communications, Media Technology and Resources and solid in Financial Services. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in managed services and strong in consulting. The business environment is competitive, and we continue to experience lower pricing across the business. We define pricing as contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. 
 In our consulting business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 7 in U.S. dollars and 6 in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Consulting revenue growth in local currency for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was driven by very strong growth in the Americas, solid growth in EMEA and modest growth in Asia Pacific. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their reinvention, in particular technology, data, and AI led digital transformations. This includes moving to the cloud, embedding security and responsible AI across the enterprise and leveraging our change capabilities to help our clients build new skills and drive the successful adoption of new processes and technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and supply chain and operational resilience, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. While we continue to experience demand for these services, we are seeing a slower pace and level of client spending, particularly for smaller contracts with a shorter duration. 
 In our managed services business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 11 in both U.S. dollars and local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Managed services revenue growth in local currency for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was driven by very strong growth in the Americas and EMEA, and solid growth in Asia Pacific. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and cybersecurity-as-a-service. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through technology, data and AI, and leveraging our digital platforms and talent to drive productivity and operational cost savings. 
 As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. While a significant portion of our revenues are in U.S. dollars, the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1 higher than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2025, we estimate that our full fiscal 2025 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 0.5 lower than our revenue growth in local currency.

 Utilization for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 91 , consistent with the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 799,000 as of November 30, 2024, compared to approximately 743,000 as of November 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions. 
 For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 12 , up from 11 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand.

 ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 25 

In addition, we adjust compensation to provide market relevant pay based on the skills of our people and locations where we operate. We also consider a variety of factors, including the macroeconomic environment, in making our decisions around pay and benefits. We strive to adjust pricing as well as drive cost and delivery efficiencies, such as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology, to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin and contract profitability. 
 Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees.

 We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large managed services contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, managed services bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. 
 Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, Financial Statements. Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.

 (1) During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, our Latin America market unit moved from Growth Markets to North America. With this change, North America became the Americas market and Growth Markets became the Asia Pacific market. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. 
 Geographic Markets 
 The following revenues commentary discusses the primary drivers of local currency revenue changes by geographic market for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024: 
 Americas revenues increased 11 in local currency, led by growth in Industrial, Software Platforms, Banking Capital Markets and Consumer Goods, Retail Travel Services. Revenue growth was driven by the United States, as well as Argentina, which continued to grow in local currency due primarily to hyperinflation. 
 EMEA revenues increased 6 in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Life Sciences and Health, partially offset by a decline in Banking Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom and Italy, partially offset by a decline in France. 
 Asia Pacific revenues increased 4 in local currency, led by growth in Utilities, Industrial and Health, partially offset by a decline in Chemicals Natural Resources. Revenue growth was driven by Japan, partially offset by declines in Singapore and Australia. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 1,082 million, or 8 , compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 83.3 from 84.2 during this period. 
 The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs such as facilities, technology and travel. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.

 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 
 Cost of Services 
 Cost of services for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 1,090 million, or 10 , over the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 67.1 compared to 66.4 during this period. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased as a percentage of revenues to 32.9 from 33.6 during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher subcontractor costs and the impact of our business optimization actions which reduced severance costs in gross margin during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 101 million, or 6 , over the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 10.2 from 10.5 during this period primarily due to lower labor costs. 
 General and Administrative Costs 
 General and administrative costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 30 million, or 3 , over the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.0 from 6.4 during this period primarily due to lower labor costs, partially offset by an increase in non-payroll costs. 
 Business Optimization Costs 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated actions to streamline our operations, transform our non-billable corporate functions and consolidate our office space to reduce costs. We recorded a total of 1.5 billion related to these actions, primarily for employee severance, which have been completed as of August 31, 2024. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We have presented operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis exclu ding the business optimization costs recorded in fiscal 2024 as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of this item and our performance in comparison to the prior periods. While we believe that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating our operations, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Operating Income and Operating Margin 
 Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: 
 Three Months Ended November 30, 2024 November 30, 2023 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) Americas (1) 1,377 16 1,293 16 84 EMEA 1,036 16 824 14 212 Asia Pacific (1) 535 21 448 19 87 Total 2,948 16.7 2,565 15.8 384

 Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 384 million, or 15 , compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 16.7 , compared with 15.8 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

Geographic Markets 
 We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. Additionally, costs associated with our business optimization actions did not impact fiscal 2025 operating income as the actions were completed in fiscal 2024. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024: 
 Americas operatin g income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by a decline in contract profitability. 
 EMEA operatin g income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by a decline in consulting contract profitability. 
 Asia Pacific opera ting income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by a decline in contract profitability. 
 Operating Income and Operating Margin Excluding Fiscal 2024 Business Optimization Costs (Non-GAAP) 
 The business optimization costs reduced operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 by 90 basis points . Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 remained flat compared to adjusted operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 of 16.7 .

With this change, North America became the Americas market and Growth Markets became the Asia Pacific market. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 76 million, a decrease of 26 million, or 25 , from the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 were 21.6 and 23.2 , respectively. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to higher benefits from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities. 
 Income Tax Expense Excluding Fiscal 2024 Business Optimization Costs (Non-GAAP) 
 The business optimization costs of 140 million and related reduction in tax expense of 34 million had an immaterial impact on our adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 . 
 Earnings Per Share 
 Diluted earnings per share were 3.59 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with 3.10 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, Financial Statements.

Earnings Per Share Excluding Fiscal 2024 Business Optimization Costs (Non-GAAP) 
 The business optimization costs of 106 million, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by 0.17 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were 3.27 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Three Months Ended November 30, 2023 As Reported 3.10 Business optimization costs 0.22 Tax effect of business optimization costs (1) (0.05) November 30, 2023 As Adjusted 3.27 November 30, 2024 As Reported 3.59 
 (1) The income tax effect of business optimization costs includes both the current and deferred income tax impact and was calculated by using the relevant tax rate of the country where the adjustments were recorded. 
 The increase in diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was due to the following factors: 
 Three Months Ended November 30, 2023 As Adjusted 3.27 Higher revenue and operating results 0.29 Lower effective tax rate 0.07 Lower share count 0.01 Lower non-operating income (0.05) November 30, 2024 As Reported 3.59 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of November 30, 2024, Cash and cash equivalents was 8.3 billion, compared with 5.0 billion as of August 31, 2024. 
 Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: 
 Three Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) November 30, 2024 November 30, 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,022 499 524 Investing activities (386) (855) 470 Financing activities 2,752 (1,552) 4,304 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (87) 5 (92) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 3,302 (1,904) 5,206 
 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 
 Operating activities: The 524 million increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
 Investing activities: The 470 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, Financial Statements. 
 Financing activities: The 4,304 million increase in financing cash flows was primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings. For additional information, see Note 9 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, Financial Statements. 
 We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 30 

Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. 
 Borrowings and Indebtedness 
 On September 30, 2024, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3, pursuant to which Accenture plc s wholly owned finance subsidiaries Accenture Capital and Accenture Global Capital DAC may issue debt securities. As of November 30, 2024, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes issued by Accenture Capital in an aggregate principal amount of 5 billion, which mature from 2027 through 2034. Accenture plc fully and unconditionally guarantees these notes, as well as all future debt securities that may be issued by these entities. 
 For additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings, credit facilities and other debt, see Note 9 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, Financial Statements. 
 Share Purchases and Redemptions 
 The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. 
 Our share purchase activity during the three months ended November 30, 2024 is as follows: 
 Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Shares Amount Shares Amount Open-market share purchases (1) 2,174,686 771 Other share purchase programs 2,375 1 Other purchases (2) 353,046 126 Total 2,527,732 897 2,375 1 
 (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. 
 (2) During the three months ended November 30, 2024, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. 
 We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2025. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. 
 To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 11 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, Financial Statements. 
 Significant Accounting Policies

INTRODUCTION 
 The Accenture LLP Leadership Separation Benefits Plan (the Plan is a plan maintained by Accenture LLP that provides Separation Benefits to eligible Managing Directors of Accenture LLP (and those of its Affiliates that have adopted the Plan with Accenture s consent, including Accenture Federal Services). The Plan only applies to eligible Managing Directors other employees may be covered by a different plan. This summary explains the main features of the Plan as in effect for individuals notified of their termination on or after the Restated Effective Date. 
 This document serves as both the Summary Plan Description for the Plan and the official Plan document. It explains the principal terms of the Plan in non-technical language. In the event of a conflict between the Plan and any other communications, the terms of the Plan will govern. 
 Capitalized terms used in the Plan are defined in a Glossary of Terms at the end of this document. To better understand your rights under the Plan, you should familiarize yourself with those terms. 
 The term you as used in the Plan refers to an employee who is eligible for the Plan or a Participant, as the context dictates. Receipt of this document does not guarantee that the recipient is in fact an eligible employee or a Participant under the Plan. 
 YOUR ELIGIBILITY FOR SEPARATION BENEFITS 
 To be eligible for the Plan, you must meet all the described requirements. Employees who are eligible for Separation Benefits are called Participants. 
 You will become a Participant if (1) you are on Accenture s regular payroll in the United States as a Managing Director or a Senior Managing Director on your Termination Date, (2) your employment with Accenture is involuntarily terminated, including a mutual managed departure, for reasons other than Cause (as determined by Accenture in its sole discretion), and (3) you submit (and do not later revoke) a signed Separation Agreement to Accenture by the stated deadline (as further described below).

Even if you meet either set of these requirements, you will not be eligible for benefits under the Plan if any of the following applies to you 
 your employment agreement, offer letter, separation agreement, release agreement, settlement agreement or other written agreement with Accenture (or an Affiliate) clearly states that you are ineligible for benefits under the Plan, provided that members of the Global Management Committee (GMC) will continue to be eligible for the COBRA Payment and Professional Outplacement Services under the Plan, subject to any limits that apply under the terms of the Standardized Severance benefit applicable to GMC

 you fail to comply with any condition set forth in the Plan. 
 Though employees terminated for Cause are not eligible for Plan benefits, residents of Puerto Rico still may be eligible for legislatively-required severance payments, provided the circumstances of the separation do not meet the definition of Just Cause under P.R. Act No. 80. 
 Individuals performing services for Accenture who are not on Accenture s regular payroll (e.g., independent contractors and staffing agency employees) are not eligible for Separation Benefits, regardless of any subsequent reclassification as an employee or joint employee of Accenture. 
 All determinations of eligibility for the Plan will be made by Accenture in its sole discretion. 
 SEPARATION AGREEMENT REQUIREMENT 
 You will be required to sign a Separation Agreement and all other documentation, which may include a document titled Amendment to Restricted Share Unit and Other Grant Agreements to become a Participant and receive Separation Benefits, provided that your status as a Participant will not be effective until any revocation rights that may apply to your signed Separation Agreement have expired. You are advised to consult a personal attorney to review the Separation Agreement. 
 You must submit a signed Separation Agreement to Accenture not earlier than your Termination Date and not after the deadline set forth in the Separation Agreement. You may have a right to revoke the Separation Agreement. If such a right exists, it will be indicated in the Separation Agreement. Any such revocation must be in writing and must be received by Accenture during the time frame set forth in the Separation Agreement. If you choose not to submit a signed Separation Agreement to Accenture or if you effectively revoke the signed Separation Agreement, you will still terminate employment as of your Termination Date but will not be a Participant and will not be eligible to receive Separation Benefits. As noted above, Separation Agreements will not be accepted prior to your Termination Date nor after the deadline set forth in the Separation Agreement. 
 Signed Separation Agreements (and any other accompanying documents to be signed) must be returned to Accenture using Adobe Sign or such other method specified in the Separation Agreement. 
 In the event you breach the provisions of the Separation Agreement, the payment of Separation Benefits will cease and Accenture will exercise, and the employee will be bound by, the remedies provided in the Separation Agreement.

 COBRA Payment 
 The COBRA Payment will be paid whether or not the Participant is enrolled for coverage in the Active Medical Plan and whether or not the Participant elects COBRA Continuation Coverage. To receive COBRA Continuation Coverage, a Participant must elect such coverage in accordance with the terms of the Active Medical Plan and otherwise comply with the terms and conditions that apply. 
 -4- 

Professional Outplacement Services 
 Each Participant, including a Participant terminated for Performance Reasons, is entitled to participate in a Managing Director Professional Outplacement Services program to be provided by an outside firm selected by Accenture. Each Participant will receive from Accenture separate, detailed information about the Professional Outplacement Services program, including the duration of the program, the types of available services, how to enroll, and the locations of available programs. No Participant may receive cash in lieu of the Professional Outplacement Services. A Participant must enroll in the Professional Outplacement Services program in order to participate enrollment is not automatic. A Participant may enroll in the Professional Outplacement Services program after the date the Participant submits the Separation Agreement or, in the case of a Participant entitled to revoke the Separation Agreement, upon expiration of the applicable revocation period. A Participant must enroll in the Professional Outplacement Services program no later than sixty (60) days after the Termination Date or, in the case of a Participant entitled to revoke the Separation Agreement, no later than sixty (60) days after the date the revocation period expires. 
 PAYMENT TIMING 
 Unless otherwise required by law and except as provided in the following sentence, Separation Pay will be paid in a single lump sum on the next regular payroll date following the date Accenture receives the signed Separation Agreement or, in the case of a Participant entitled to revoke the signed Separation Agreement, the next regular payroll date following the date the applicable revocation period expires (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter in accordance with Accenture s payroll procedures). If a Participant dies before receiving full payment of their Separation Pay, remaining unpaid amounts will be paid to their estate. 
 SHORT TERM DISABILITY WAGE REPLACEMENT 
 As of their Termination Date, if a Participant (1) is receiving short-term disability wage replacement benefits, (2) is approved to receive short-term disability wage replacement benefits but has not yet commenced, or (3) has started the process to receive or extend short-term disability wage replacement benefits for an event that has occurred or is to occur no later than thirty (30) days following their Termination Date and Accenture determines that they are eligible for such benefit, the Participant s Separation Pay will include additional Base Pay (as described below) for the lesser of (i) the number of weeks (if any) of disability wage replacement benefits occurring after the Termination Date the Participant is scheduled to receive, or (ii) eight weeks, and their COBRA Payment will be increased by the same number of weeks. If the number of weeks in (or remaining in) the Participant s short-term disability wage replacement benefits after the Termination Date is not known prior to the payment of their Separation Pay, they will receive eight weeks of Base Pay. For purposes of this paragraph only, Base Pay is determined by Accenture in accordance with Accenture s short-term disability wage replacement benefit, as set forth under the U.S. Leaves of Absence Policy (1018), as amended from time to time. 
 -5- 

MATERNITY LEAVE PARENTAL CAREGIVER LEAVE WAGE REPLACEMENT 
 As of their Termination Date, if a Participant is on, or has submitted a request for, but has not yet begun, maternity leave and or parental leave under Parental Leave Birth, Adoption and Surrogacy Policy (1491) and Accenture determines that they are eligible for such leave, their Separation Pay also will include an amount equal to their Base Pay (as described below) for the number of weeks to which the Participant would otherwise be entitled under the policy following their Termination Date, and their COBRA Payment will be increased by the same number of weeks. For purposes of this paragraph only, Base Pay is determined by Accenture in accordance with Policy 1491, as amended from time to time. If the Participant is aligned to the Puerto Rico location, any amount owed under this paragraph will be reduced by any payment the Participant already received for maternity leave and or parental leave under Policy 1491. 
 If a Participant satisfies the requirements to receive additional benefits under both the provision above titled, Short Term Disability Wage Replacement, and the provision titled, Maternity Leave Parental Caregiver Leave Wage Replacement, the Participant will receive benefits only under the provision that provides the greater benefit and will not be eligible for benefits under the provision that provides the lesser benefit. If the benefits are the same under each provision, the Participant will receive the benefits under Short Term Disability Wage Replacement. 
 RETURN OF ACCENTURE PROPERTY TIME REPORTS 
 As a condition of becoming a Participant and receiving Separation Benefits under the Plan, you must (1) return to Accenture all Accenture property (e.g., building keys, credit cards, documents and records, identification cards, office equipment, portable computers, parking cards, computer drives) and (2) return to Accenture s clients all client property (e.g., building keys, credit cards, documents and records, identification cards, office equipment, portable computers, mobile phones, parking cards, computer drives). Any Accenture property and client property must be returned no later than your Termination Date, or such later date as expressly agreed to by Accenture. The following are also pre-conditions of receiving Separation Benefits 
 The balance of any expense against your Accenture personnel number must be zero. 
 You must submit final time reports and all outstanding expense receipts. 
 The unpaid balance of any Accenture-related credit cards or credit accounts issued to you, including a Corporate American Express card, must be zero. If you have a credit card or credit account balance, Accenture may require either (1) payment of the outstanding balance within 60 days of the Termination Date or (2) deduction of the outstanding balance from the Separation Benefits, to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
 Accenture reserves the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to reduce (on a dollar-for-dollar basis) the amount of any Separation Benefits payable to a Participant under the Plan by any disability, severance, separation, termination pay, or pay-in-lieu of notice amounts that Accenture pays or is required to pay to the Participant through insurance or otherwise under any plan or contract of Accenture (including the amount of any compensation payable and the value of any benefits to be provided during any notice period under an employment agreement with 
 -6- 

Accenture or any Affiliate) or under any federal or state law (other than unemployment compensation). In addition, Accenture reserves the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to reduce the amount of Separation Benefits payable to a Participant under the Plan by the amount, if any, that the Participant owes Accenture (or an Affiliate). 
 IMPACT OF REEMPLOYMENT ON SEPARATION BENEFITS 
 If you accept a job offer from Accenture or an Affiliate or, as a result of an exception to Policy 1420, you become a Contractor with Accenture or an Affiliate after your Termination Date, and the date you begin employment or the contracting engagement (such date, the Start Date ), as applicable, occurs prior to expiration of the Separation Pay Period, your entitlement to Separation Benefits will be affected as follows 
 Start Date Prior to Payment - If your Start Date occurs before your Separation Pay has been paid to you, your Separation Pay but not the COBRA Payment will be reduced to an amount equal to the number of weeks that passed from your Termination Date to your Start Date, and you will not be entitled to Professional Outplacement Services. 
 Start Date After Payment - If your Start Date occurs after your Separation Pay has been paid to you, you must repay to Accenture a prorated amount of your Separation Pay within 15 days following your Start Date, but not the COBRA Payment or the cost of any Professional Outplacement Services. The amount of your Separation Pay you are required to repay is equal to the total number of weeks represented by your Separation Pay less the number of full weeks that passed from your Termination Date to your Start Date. Accenture, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to decide not to require repayment. 
 Note If the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines that your new position is not a Comparable Position, the provisions above will apply to you, but you will be permitted to receive and retain 50 of the Separation Pay otherwise payable to you based on the chart above, and the full COBRA Payment. 
 For purposes of this section, the following rules apply (1) Separation Pay means your Base Benefit and your Variable Benefit, and (2) each month of your Base Benefit is treated as representing 4 weeks. 
 REPAYMENTS AND FORFEITURES 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, a Participant is required to reimburse Accenture for the full amount of Separation Benefits received by the Participant under the Plan if the Participant subsequently discloses any of Accenture s (or an Affiliate s) trade secrets, violates any written covenants or agreements with Accenture or an Affiliate, including but not limited to non-compete and non-solicitation provisions in any employment or equity agreement, or otherwise engages in conduct that may adversely affect Accenture s (or an Affiliate s) reputation or business relations. In addition, the Participant will immediately forfeit any right to benefits under the Plan that have not yet been paid. Accenture will take such steps as it deems necessary or desirable to enforce the provisions of this subsection. 
 -7- 

OTHER PLANS 
 The Plan supersedes and replaces all other severance or separation plans, programs, policies, or practices of Accenture, other than the Accenture United States Separation Benefits Plan. 
 Separation Benefits (if any) will not be included as eligible compensation for purposes of any of Accenture s pay-based benefits, such as 401(k), profit sharing, retirement, life insurance, and long-term disability. 
 Payments or benefits provided to a Participant under any deferred compensation, savings, retirement, or other employee benefit plan of Accenture are governed solely by the terms of such plan. Nothing in this Plan limits Accenture s right to, at any time or for any reason, modify, amend, or terminate any of Accenture s employee benefit or compensation plans, programs, policies, or arrangements. 
 PLAN ADMINISTRATION 
 Accenture LLP is responsible for the administration and operation of the Plan. Accenture LLP is the Plan s plan administrator and named fiduciary (within the meaning of such terms under ERISA). 
 Accenture LLP may adopt from time to time such rules as may be necessary or desirable for the proper and efficient administration of the Plan and as are consistent with the terms of the Plan. These rules will be applied on a uniform basis to similarly situated individuals. 
 In administering the Plan, Accenture LLP has the authority, exercisable in its sole discretion, to construe and interpret the provisions of the Plan and to make factual determinations thereunder, including the discretionary authority to determine the eligibility of employees (or other individuals) and the amount of benefits payable under the Plan. Any decisions made by Accenture are final and conclusive with respect to all questions concerning the Plan and are binding on all parties. 
 Accenture may delegate to one or more of its employees or other persons the responsibility for performing certain of Accenture s duties under the terms of the Plan and may seek such expert advice as Accenture deems reasonably necessary with respect to the Plan. 
 BENEFIT DETERMINATIONS 
 No benefits will be provided to any individual under the Plan unless Accenture LLP decides in its sole discretion that the individual is entitled to benefits under the Plan. 
 AMENDMENT TERMINATION 
 Accenture LLP reserves the right in its sole discretion to amend or terminate the Plan at any time by a written instrument adopted by an authorized officer or employee of Accenture LLP. 
 -8- 

No employee, officer, director, or agent of Accenture has the authority to alter, vary or modify the terms of the Plan, except by means of an authorized written amendment to the Plan. No verbal or written representations contrary to the terms of the Plan and its written amendments are binding upon Accenture or the Plan. 
 NO ASSIGNMENT 
 Separation Benefits are not to be subject to anticipation, alienation, pledge, sale, transfer, assignment, garnishment, attachment, execution, encumbrance, levy, or lien, and any attempt to cause such benefits to be so subjected will not be recognized, except to the extent required by applicable law or otherwise set forth in the Plan. 
 NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS 
 The Plan does not confer employment rights upon any person. No person is entitled, by virtue of the Plan, to remain in the employ of Accenture or to be rehired, and nothing in the Plan restricts the right of Accenture to terminate the employment of any person at any time. 
 NO ADDITIONAL BENEFITS RIGHTS 
 Neither eligibility for, nor participation in, the Plan gives any employee a right or claim to any benefit under the Plan, unless such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the Plan. 
 PLAN FUNDING 
 The Plan does not confer on any Participant (or any other individual) any right in or title to any assets, funds, or property of Accenture. Any benefits payable under the Plan are unfunded obligations of Accenture and will be paid from Accenture s general assets. 
 PLAN TYPE APPLICABLE LAW 
 The Plan is an unfunded welfare benefit plan for purposes of ERISA, a severance pay plan within the meaning of Department of Labor Reg. 2510.3-2(b) and an involuntary separation pay program under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii). 
 The Plan is governed and will be construed in accordance with ERISA. To the extent not superseded by ERISA or other federal law, the laws of the state of Illinois will apply to the Plan. 
 INFORMATION TO BE FURNISHED BY PARTICIPANTS 
 Each Participant must furnish to Accenture such documents, evidence, data, or other information as Accenture considers necessary or desirable for the purpose of administering the Plan. Benefits under the Plan for each Participant are provided on the condition that the Participant will furnish full, true, and complete data, evidence, or other information and that the Participant will promptly sign any document required under the Plan or requested by Accenture. 
 -9- 

WORDING 
 Where the context permits, words in the plural will include the singular, and the singular will include the plural. 
 MISTAKE OF FACT 
 Any mistake of fact or misstatement of fact will be corrected when it becomes known and proper adjustment made by reason thereof. A Participant must repay to Accenture any benefits paid under this Plan by mistake of fact or law. 
 SEVERABILITY 
 In the event any provision of the Plan is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity will not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan will be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provisions had never been included in the Plan. 
 WITHHOLDING 
 Accenture reserves the right to withhold from any amounts payable under this Plan all federal, state, city, and local taxes as are legally required, as well as any other amounts authorized or required by Accenture policy including, but not limited to, withholding for garnishments and judgments or other court orders. Any amounts you owe to Accenture may be deducted from your Separation Benefits, subject to applicable law. 
 BENEFIT CLAIMS PROCEDURES 
 You do not need to apply for benefits under the Plan. However, if you wish to file a claim for benefits, you (or your authorized representative) may make a claim by filing a written description of your claim with Accenture LLP within 180 days of your Termination Date. Accenture LLP will notify you in writing if your claim is granted. If your claim is denied, Accenture LLP will notify you of its decision, setting forth the specific reasons for the denial, references to the Plan provisions on which the denial is based, additional information necessary to perfect the claim, if any, and a description of the procedure for review of the denial. Any written claim decision will be sent to you within 90 days (or 180 days if warranted by special circumstances) after Accenture LLP received your claim. 
 You (or your authorized representative) may request a review of a complete or partial denial of your claim for benefits. Any such request must be in writing and must be received by Accenture LLP within 60 days after you received the notice of the denial of your claim. You will be entitled to review pertinent Plan documents and submit written issues and comments to Accenture LLP. Within 60 days (or 120 days if warranted by special circumstances) after Accenture LLP receives your request for review, Accenture LLP will furnish you with written notice of its decision, setting forth the specific reasons for the decision and references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based. 
 -10- 

You (or your authorized representative) may not challenge a decision of Accenture LLP in court or in any other administrative proceeding unless you have complied with the claim and appeal procedures described above and such procedures have been completed. If your claim for benefits is finally denied by Accenture LLP, you may only bring suit in court (or other administrative proceeding) if you file such action within 120 days after the date of the final denial of your claim by Accenture LLP. No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover benefits under this Plan until the appeal rights herein provided have been exercised and the Plan benefits requested in such appeal have been denied in whole or in part. 
 RIGHTS UNDER ERISA 
 Each Participant in the Plan is entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA. ERISA provides that Participants will be entitled to 
 Examine, without charge, at Accenture LLP s offices, all documents governing the Plan, and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 series) filed by Accenture LLP with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration. 
 Upon written request to Accenture LLP, obtain copies of documents governing the operation of the Plan, a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 series), and an updated summary plan description. Accenture LLP may make a reasonable charge for the copies. 
 In addition to creating rights for Participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan. The people who operate the Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of the Participants. No one, including Accenture or any other person, may fire any person or otherwise discriminate against a person in any way to prevent him or her from obtaining a benefit or exercising their rights under ERISA. If a claim for benefits is denied, in whole or in part, the claimant has the right to know why this was done, obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. 
 Under ERISA, there are steps a person can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if a person requests a copy of the Plan documents or the Plan s latest annual report from Accenture LLP and such person does not receive them within thirty days, they may file suit in a federal court. In such case, the court may require Accenture LLP to provide the requested materials and pay such person up to 110 per day until they receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of Accenture LLP. If a person has a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, they may file suit in a state or federal court. If it should happen that the fiduciaries misuse a plan s money, or if an individual is discriminated against for asserting their rights, they may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor or may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If a person is successful in the lawsuit, the court may order the person sued to pay these cost fees. If the person filing the lawsuit loses, the court may order that person to pay these costs and fees for instance, if it finds the claim to be frivolous.

If that person has any questions about this statement or about ERISA, they should contact the nearest area office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, listed in the telephone directory, or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

 -15- 

Week of Pay means the amount determined by dividing a Participant s annual Base Salary by 52. 
 Years of Service means, with respect to a Participant, each complete twelve-month period of the Participant s service with Accenture or an Affiliate, beginning with the earlier of (a) the Participant s most recent date of hire with a business entity which Accenture or an Affiliate acquired, or (b) the Participant s last date of hire with Accenture or an Affiliate (based on the applicable payroll records) and ending on their Termination Date, unless otherwise noted in the Participant s offer letter or employment agreement. Periods of service prior to a Participant s last date of hire with the acquired entity, Accenture or an Affiliate, as applicable, will not be counted for purposes of the Plan, unless otherwise noted in the Participant s offer letter or employment agreement.
