-years for patents, -years for internally developed software and -years for website related cost. Intangible
assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment at least annually, and additionally whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible
assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized
for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. We recognized a intangible asset impairment charge during the three
months ended October 31, 2024. There were no t any intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the three months ended October 31, 2023.

ASC
Topic 740-10-30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740-10-40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We have no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting
periods presented. 

for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and for its most recent fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, the Company now has significant working capital, however, we have a history of losses, an accumulated deficit, and have not generated cash from our operations to support a meaningful and ongoing business plan. It is management s
opinion that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

In
view of these matters, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the continuing development, marketing and sales of
a viable product to achieve a level of profitability. We intend to finance our future development activities and our working capital
needs from the sale of private and public equity securities with additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including
term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. Although the Company
believes in the viability of management s strategy to generate sufficient revenue, control costs and the ability to raise additional
capital, there can be no assurances to that effect. Therefore, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary
should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

April 18, 2024, the Lender filed a motion seeking partial summary judgment on its First Cause of Action against BERI and its Second Cause
of Action against Scott M. Boruff in the amount of , plus their actual and reasonable attorneys fees. Neither the Company
nor its subsidiaries were included in the motion seeking partial summary judgment. 

In
the event the Lender attempts to enforce the alleged guarantees against our subsidiaries, we believe we have valid defenses against such
an action. In addition, both subsidiaries previously discontinued their operations and currently have no assets. In the judgement of
the Company s management, if the pending actions were adversely determined they would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company.

Item
2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE
FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR PLAN OF OPERATION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
RELATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT
RELATE TO FUTURE EVENTS OR OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE STATEMENTS INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER
FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS, LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY FUTURE
RESULTS, LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE RISKS AND OTHER
FACTORS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THOSE LISTED UNDER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS AND THOSE INCLUDED
ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. 

This
following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the interim consolidated financial statements, financial condition,
liquidity, and cash flows of Healthcare Integrated Technologies, Inc, for the three months ended October 31, 2024, and 2023. The discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on October 29, 2024. 

Healthcare
Integrated Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries is a healthcare technology company based in Knoxville, Tennessee. We are creating
a diversified spectrum of healthcare technology solutions to integrate and automate the continuing care, home care and professional healthcare
spaces. 

Our
initial product, SafeSpace with AI Vision , is an ambient fall detection solution designed for continuing care communities
and at home use. SafeSpace includes hardware devices utilizing RGB, radar and other sensor technology coupled with our internally developed
software to effectively monitor a person remotely. In continuing care communities, SafeSpace detects resident falls and generates alerts
to a centralized, intelligent dashboard without the use of wearable devices or any action by the resident. In the home, SafeSpace detects
falls and sends alerts directly to designated individuals. 

We
recently introduced and are currently pilot testing two additional products - SafeFace and SafeGuard . SafeFace provides
fully automated and ambient time and attendance reporting for facility staff, and an integrated and automatic agency invoice reconciliation
feature. SafeGuard is a novel fully ambient elopement detection and alerting system based on our facial recognition technology. 

In
addition to our current product offerings, we are developing a home concierge healthcare service application to provide a virtual assisted
living experience for seniors, recently released postoperative patients, and others. The concierge application will enable the consumer
to obtain home healthcare services and health and safety monitoring equipment to improve quality of life. We are also working to develop
a fully integrated solution for the professional healthcare community that integrates electronic health records, remote patient monitoring,
telehealth, and other items where integration is beneficial. 

Strategy 

Our
mission is to grow a profitable healthcare technology company by focusing on our core product, continuing the development of our proprietary
software, and developing new uses and product lines for our technology. Our management team is focused on maintaining financial flexibility
and assembling the right complement of personnel and outside consultants required to successfully execute our mission.

Financial
and Operating Results 

We
continue to utilize funds raised from the private sales of our common stock, issuance of debt, and short-term advances from related parties
to provide cash for our operations, which has allowed us to continue refining our initial product and readying it for pilot testing,
developing future product offerings and adding talented individuals to our management team and on a contract basis. Highlighted achievements
for the three months ended October 31, 2024 include: 

On
 August 23, 2024, we appointed Micheal Coach Burt to our Board of Directors. 

On
 October 1, 2024, we appointed Timothy R. Brady as Fractional Chief Financial Officer. 

On
 November 5, 2024, we announced the appointment of Caleb Dixon as Chief Customer Officer to focus on enhancing customer engagement
 and satisfaction. 

We
 received 2,452,000 in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock at an average price of 0.10 per share during the three months
 ending October 31, 2024.

Officers 
Salaries - Officers salaries increased 50,370, or 58 , over 2023 and is primarily due to the addition of our new Chief Strategy
Officer and our Chief Executive Officer s increased pay over the previous period, the Company s officers accepted voluntary
pay reductions in the prior comparable period. 

Contract
labor Contract labor increased 36,011 over 2023 and is attributable to the addition of new finance and accounting personnel. 

Professional
Fees - Professional fees increased 29,813, or 70 . over the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased accounting
and legal fees and the addition of a grant writing consultant.

Software
Development Software development expenses increased 29,806 over 2023 due to an increase in the use of independent contractors
for specific development projects. 

Travel
and entertainment Travel and entertainment expense increased 23,915, or 2,847 , over the same period in the prior year.
The increase is primarily due to increased business travel by the senior management team.

Current
assets for the interim period ended October 31, 2024 increased 2,044,100 as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. The
increase is primarily due to the receipt of 2,452,000 in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock at an average price of
 0.10 per share during the three months ending October 31, 2024. 

6 

Current
liabilities for the interim period ended October 31, 2024 decreased 78,299 as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. The decrease
is due to decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a reduction in payroll liabilities. 

Net
Cash Used by Operating Activities 

We
currently do not have a revenue source and will continue to have negative cash flow from operations for the near future. The factors
in determining operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, except for non-cash expenses such as depreciation
and amortization, stock-based compensation, and impairment of intangibles, which affect earnings but do not affect operating cash flow.
Net cash used by operating activities was 378,667 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to net cash provided by operating
activities of 3,049 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The increase in cash used by operating activities is primarily
attributable to an increase in operating costs and the payment of accounts payable and accrued expenses, including related party items. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 2,216,767 for the three months ended October 31, 2024, which represents a 2,213,998 increase
over the same period of 2023. The increase is primarily due to the receipt of 2,452,000 in net proceeds from the sale of our
common stock at an average price of 0.10 per share during the three months ending October 31, 2024. 

Going
Concern Qualification 

At
this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding from debt financings and/or
the sale of our equity securities to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. We are likely to continue using short-term loans
from management to meet our short-term funding needs. We have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of October 31, 2024. 

We
have a history of losses, an accumulated deficit, negative working capital and have not generated cash from operations to support a meaningful
and ongoing business plan. Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm has included a Going Concern Qualification 
in their report for the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. We intend on financing our future activities and working capital needs largely from the sale of private
and/or public equity securities with additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time
that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. There is no guarantee that additional capital
or debt financing will be available when and to the extent required, or that if available, it will be on terms acceptable to us. The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Going
Concern Qualification might make it substantially more difficult to raise capital. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires
the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets,
liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external
disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying
accounting assumptions adhere to U.S. GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of
our financial statements. 

7 

Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. 

We
believe the following critical policies impact our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements. 

Business
Combinations 

We
account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets
and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and that changes thereafter be
reflected in income (loss). The estimation of fair values of the assets and liabilities assumed involves several estimates and assumptions
that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded. The results of the acquired businesses are included in our results from
operations beginning from the day of acquisition. 

In
accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses , we recognize an allowance for credit losses on acquired
financial assets with credit deterioration since origination. The allowance of credit losses is measured based on the Current Expected
Credit Loss (CECL) model, which requires an estimate of the expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset. This estimate
considers historical loss information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit losses,
if any, is recorded as a reduction to the carrying amount of the financial asset, with a corresponding charge to earnings. 

Risk
and Uncertainties 

Factors
that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from management s expectation include,
but are not limited to: our ability to maintain and secure adequate capital to fund our operations and fully develop our product(s);
our ability to source strong opportunities with sufficient risk adjusted returns; acceptance of the terms and conditions of our licenses
and/or the acceptance of our royalties and fees; the nature and extent of competition from other companies that may reduce market share
and create pressure on pricing and investment return expectations; changes in the projects in which we plan to invest which result from
factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, a change in circumstances, capacity and economic impacts; changes in laws,
regulations, accounting, taxation, and other requirements affecting our operations and business. Negative developments in these or other
risk factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. We base our estimates on experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and actual results may differ from those estimates. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between
market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as
follows: 

Level
1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the
measurement date. 

Level
2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as
interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market
data by correlation or other means. 

Level
3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity s own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. 

8 

Financial
instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and borrowings. The fair value of current financial
assets and current financial liabilities approximates their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. 

Intangible
Assets 

Intangible
assets consist of patents, our website and the costs of software developed for internal use. Certain payroll and stock-based compensation
costs incurred are allocated to the intangible assets. We determine the amount of costs to be capitalized based on the time spent by
employees or outside contractors on the projects. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful life on a straight-line
basis. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. If the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining life is changed,
the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived
assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever facts and circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized
based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets,
if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment
loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. 

Derivative
Liability 

Options,
warrants, convertible notes, or other contracts, if any, are evaluated to determine if those contracts, or embedded components of those
contracts, qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, (paragraph 815-10-05-4
and Section 815-40-25). The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market
each balance sheet date and recorded as either an asset or a liability. The change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or cancellation of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked
to fair value at the date of conversion, exercise, or cancellation and then the related fair value is reclassified to equity. 

In
circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated, and there are also other
embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments
are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument. 

The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed
at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification
are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities will
be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument
is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

The
Company adopted Section 815-40-15 of the FASB ASC Section 815-40-15 to determine whether an instrument (or an
embedded feature) is indexed to the Company s own stock. Section 815-40-15 provides that an entity should use a two- step approach
to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock, including evaluating the
instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions. 

We
utilize a binomial option pricing model to compute the fair value of the derivative liability and to mark to market the fair value of
the derivative at each balance sheet date. We record the change in the fair value of the derivative as other income or expense in the
consolidated statements of operations. 

9 

Related
Parties 

The
Company follows subtopic ASC 850-10 for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. Pursuant
to Section 850-10-20, the related parties include: (a) affiliates of the Company Affiliate means, with respect to any
specified person, any other person that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is
under common control with such person, as such terms are used in and construed under Rule 405 under the Securities Act); (b) entities
for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value
Option Subsection of Section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; (c) trusts for the benefit
of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; (d) principal owners
of the Company; (e) management of the Company; (f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly
influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from
fully pursuing its own separate interests; and (g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies
of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other
to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. 

Contract
Liabilities 

The
Company receives payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Contract liabilities include payments received in
advance of performance under the contract. Contract assets include amounts related to the Company s contractual right to consideration
for completed performance obligations not yet invoiced. Our contract assets and liabilities are reported on an individual contract basis
at the end of each reporting period. Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect
to recognize revenue. The Company expects to recognize all outstanding contract liabilities over the next 12 months. 

Contract
Combination 

The
Company may execute more than one contract or agreement with a single customer. The Company evaluates whether the agreements were negotiated
as a package with a single objective, whether the amount of consideration to be paid in one agreement depends on the price and/or performance
of another agreement, or whether the goods or services promised in the agreements represent a single performance obligation. The conclusions
reached can impact the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation and the timing of revenue recognition related
to those arrangements. The Company applied the revenue model to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics where we expected
that the financial statements would not differ materially from applying it to the individual contracts within that portfolio. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenue
is recognized under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method. Under
this method, the Company follows the five-step model provided by ASC Topic 606 in order to recognize revenue in the following manner:
1) Identify the contract; 2) Identify the performance obligations of the contract; 3) Determine the transaction price of the contract;
4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) Recognize revenue. An entity recognizes revenue for the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. 

Often
contracts contain more than one performance obligation. Performance obligations are the unit of accounting for revenue recognition and
generally represent the distinct goods or services that are promised to the customer. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected
and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. If we determine that we have not satisfied a performance obligation, we defer
recognition of the revenue until the performance obligation is satisfied. The agreements are generally non-cancellable or contain significant
penalties for early cancellation, although customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we fail to perform
material obligations. However, if non-standard acceptance periods, non-standard performance criteria, or cancellation or right of refund
terms are required, revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of such criteria. 

 Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation 
 ASC 718 which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation. It
defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The Company accounts for compensation
cost for stock option plans, if any, in accordance with ASC 718. 

10 

Stock-based
payments, excluding restricted stock, are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Grants of stock-based payment awards issued
to non-employees for services rendered have been recorded at the fair value of the stock-based payment, which is the more readily determinable
value. The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally the vesting period. If
an award is granted, but vesting does not occur, any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed in the period related to the
termination of service. Stock-based compensation expenses are included in cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses,
depending on the nature of the services provided, in the consolidated statements of operations. Stock-based payments issued to placement
agents are classified as a direct cost of a stock offering and are recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital. 

The
Company recognizes all forms of stock-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants, at their fair
value on the grant date, which are based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. 

Capital
Resources 

We
had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of October 31, 2024. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2024. 

Item
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We
do not hold any market risk sensitive instruments. We consider our interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest
rates on 100 of our debt. At October 31, 2024, there was no floating rate debt that would expose us to market fluctuations in interest
rates. 

Item
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation
Date ). In conducting its evaluation, management considered the material weaknesses described below in Management s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

Based
on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the Evaluation Date we did not
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that were effective in providing reasonable assurances that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange act of 1934 was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
prescribed by SEC rules and regulations, and that such information was accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 Our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act,
during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
