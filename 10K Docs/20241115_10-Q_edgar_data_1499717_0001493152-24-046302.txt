This EOR service offering could be easily added to the
Company s other Brands (as defined below), providing for a growth element within the existing client base. The Headway
business also brought an active workforce in all 50 states in the US, as well as Puerto Rico and Washington DC. This will provide
for potential expansion of accounts for all brands in the group s portfolio Brands ). 

The
Company has developed a centralized, sales and recruitment hub. The addition of Headway, with its single office, and nationwide coverage
for operations, supports and accelerates the Company s objective of driving efficiencies using technology, deemphasizing
bricks and mortar, supporting more efficient and cost-effective service delivery for all Brands. 

The
Company has a management team with significant operational and M A experience. The combination of this management experience and
the increased opportunity for expansion of its core Brands with EOR services and nationwide expansion, provide for the opportunity of
significant organic growth, while plans to continue its business model, finding and acquiring suitable, mature, profitable, operating,
U.S. based staffing companies continues.

and a working capital deficit of .
On September 28, 2024, we had total gross debt of 
and 
of cash on hand. We have historically met our cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, term loans,
promissory notes, convertible notes, private placement offerings and sales of equity. Our cash requirements are generally for
operating activities and debt repayments. 

Due
to the timing of select liabilities coming due, we are in discussion with our lenders to determine the best manner to settle these liabilities. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared assuming that we will continue
as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
Significant assumptions underlie this belief, including, among other things, that there will be no material adverse developments in our
business, liquidity, capital requirements and that our credit facilities with our lenders will remain available to us. 

Further,
the notes issued to Jackson Investment Group LLC Jackson includes certain financial customary covenants and the Company
is currently not in compliance. We are working with the lenders to bring the Company into compliance with these covenants. 

The
entire outstanding principal balance of the Jackson Notes (as defined herein), which was 
as of September 28, 2024, shall be due and payable on January 13, 2025. The debt represented by the Jackson Note continues to be
secured by substantially all of the Company s domestic subsidiaries assets pursuant to the Amended and Restated
Security Agreement with Jackson, dated September 15, 2017, as amended. The Company also has a 
revolving loan facility with MidCap Funding X Trust MidCap ). The MidCap facility has a maturity date of December 5,
2024.

The
Company has primarily two main forms of revenue temporary contractor revenue and permanent placement revenue. Temporary
contractor revenue is accounted for as a single performance obligation satisfied over time because the customer simultaneously
receives and consumes the benefits of the Company s performance on an hourly or daily basis. The contracts stipulate weekly or
monthly billing, and the Company has elected the as invoiced practical expedient to recognize revenue based on the
hours incurred at the contractual rate as we have the right to payment in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of
performance completed to date. Permanent placement revenue is recognized on the date the candidate s full-time employment with
the customer has commenced. The customer is invoiced on the start date, and the contract stipulates payment due under varying terms,
typically 30 days. The contract with the customer stipulates a guarantee period whereby the customer may be refunded if the employee
is terminated within a short period of time, however this has historically been infrequent, and immaterial upon occurrence. As such,
the Company s performance obligations are satisfied upon commencement of the employment, at which point control has
transferred to the customer. Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 was comprised of 
and 
of temporary contractor revenue and 
and 
of permanent placement revenue, respectively compared with

), ), and for the three and nine months ending September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate
differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 , primarily due to changes in valuation allowances in the U.S., which eliminates
the effective tax rate on current year losses, offset by current state taxes and changes to goodwill naked credit. The Company may
have experienced an IRC Section 382 limitation during 2021, for which it is in process of conducting an analysis to determine the
tax consequences of such a limitation.

Goodwill 

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. ASC 350, requires that
goodwill be tested for impairment at the operating segment level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual
basis and between annual tests when circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill may be in doubt.
ASC 280-10-50-11 states that operating segments often exhibit similar long-term financial performance if they have similar economic characteristics.
During the quarter ended September 28, 2024, management concluded the Company has two operating segments for goodwill impairment analysis
under ASC 350 such as commercial and professional. Accordingly, goodwill will no longer be tested at the unit level for the five reporting
units and will be tested for impairment at the operating segment level.

basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the
right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price. 

For
so long as the Rights are then redeemable, the Company may, in its sole discretion, except with respect to the Redemption Price, supplement
or amend any provision in the Rights Agreement without the approval of any holders of the Rights. After the Rights are no longer redeemable,
the Company may, except with respect to the Redemption Price, supplement or amend the Rights Agreement without the approval of any holders
of Rights, provided that no such supplement or amendment may adversely affect the interests of holders of the Rights, cause the Rights
Agreement to become amendable contrary to the provisions of the Rights Agreement, or cause the Rights to again to become redeemable. 

Until
a Right is exercised or exchanged, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without
limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.

future events and financial performance. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including, but not
limited to, statements about our plans, strategies, adequacy of resources and future financial results (such as revenue, gross profit,
operating profit, cash flow), are forward-looking statements. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by words like
 anticipates, believes, expects, may, will, can, could, 
 should, intends, project, predict, plans, estimates, 
 goal, target, possible, potential, would, seek, and
similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks, uncertainties
and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Because these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are
subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change,
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. Important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: our
ability to regain and maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market s Nasdaq listing standards; our ability
to continue as a going concern; negative outcome of pending and future claims and litigation; our ability to access the capital markets
by pursuing additional debt and equity financing to fund our business plan and expenses on terms acceptable to us or at all; our ability
to comply with our contractual covenants, including in respect of our debt; potential cost overruns and possible rejection of our business
model and/or sales methods; weakness in general economic conditions and levels of capital spending by customers in the industries we
serve; weakness or volatility in the financial and capital markets, which may result in the postponement or cancellation of our customers 
capital projects or the inability of our customers to pay our fees; delays or reductions in U.S. government spending; credit risks associated
with our customers; competitive market pressures; the availability and cost of qualified labor; our level of success in attracting, training
and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; changes in tax laws and other government regulations, including
the impact of health care reform laws and regulations; the possibility of incurring liability for our business activities, including,
but not limited to, the activities of our temporary employees; our performance on customer contracts; and government policies, legislation
or judicial decisions adverse to our businesses. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date hereof. We assume no obligation to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, except as required by law. We recommend readers to carefully review the entirety of this Quarterly Report on Form

the nine months ended September 28, 2024, revenue decreased by 9.6 to 131,719 as compared with 145,776 in revenue for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in revenue was more prevalent in Commercial Staffing as a result of a challenging U.S.
operating environment. Commercial Staffing declined by 17.1 and Professional Staffing Business was down by 2.6 . In the Quarter-ended
September 28, 2024, the Commercial Staffing business was down by 19.1 year-on-year with Professional Staffing up by
4.3 . 

Revenue
for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, was comprised of 130,922 of temporary contractor revenue and 797 of permanent
placement revenue, compared with 144,864 and 913 of temporary contractor revenue and permanent placement revenue, respectively,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Cost
of revenue, Gross profit and Gross margin 

Cost
of revenue includes the variable cost of labor and various non-variable costs (e.g., workers compensation insurance) relating
to employees (temporary and permanent) as well as sub-contractors and consultants. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024,
cost of revenue was 114,432, a decrease of 7.4 from 123,600 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared with a decline
in revenue of 9.6 . Overall gross profit margin declined from 15.2 to 13.1 mainly driven by the proportion of the revenue driven
by lower margin Employer of Record (EOR) being 38.6 in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 versus 32.1 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Operating
expenses 

Total
operating expenses for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, were 21,450, a decrease of 15.9 from 25,498 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating expenses was driven primarily by reductions in force put into effect in May 2023
and again in February 2024. 

Other
expenses, net 

Total
other income (expenses), net for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were 102), an increase of 96.9 from 3,262) for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by an income recognized for discontinued operations of 901 as of July
29, 2024 versus an expense of 2,879 as of September 30, 2023. 

Amortization
of debt discount and deferred financing costs for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were 347, an increase of 27, compared
with amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which were 321. In
addition, for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we had other income of 127 compared with other loss of 63 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Non-GAAP
Measures 

To
supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we also use non-GAAP financial measures
and key performance indicators KPIs in addition to our GAAP results. We believe non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs
may provide useful information for evaluating our cash operating performance, ability to service debt, compliance with debt covenants
and measurement against competitors. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial
measures may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. 

39 

We
present the following non-GAAP financial measure and KPIs in this report: 

Revenue
and Gross Profit by Business Streams We use this KPI to measure our mix of Revenue and respective profitability between our two main
lines of business due to their differing margins. For clarity, these lines of business are not our operating segments, as this information
is not currently regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate capital and resources. Rather, we use this KPI
to benchmark our business against the industry.

depreciation and amortization; acquisition, capital raising and other non-recurring expenses; other non-cash charges; impairment of goodwill;
re-measurement gain on intercompany note; restructuring charges; other income (loss); and charges the Company considers to be non-recurring
in nature such, as legal expenses associated with litigation, professional fees associated with potential and completed acquisitions.
We use this measure because we believe it provides a more meaningful understanding of our profit and cash flow generation.

Operating
Cash Flow Including Proceeds from Accounts Receivable Financing. Calculated as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities
plus net proceeds from accounts receivable financing. Because much of our temporary payroll expense is paid weekly and in advance of
clients remitting payment for invoices, operating cash flow is often weaker in staffing companies where revenue and accounts receivable
are growing. Accounts receivable financing is essentially an advance on client remittances and is primarily used to fund temporary payroll.
As such, we believe this measure is helpful to investors as an indicator of our underlying operating cash flow.

The

in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, immediately below.

Liquidity,
Going Concern and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. Historically, we have funded our operations through term loans, promissory notes, bonds, convertible notes, private
placement offerings and sales of equity. 

Our
primary uses of cash have been for debt repayments, repayment of deferred consideration from acquisitions, professional fees related
to our operations and financial reporting requirements and for the payment of compensation, benefits and consulting fees. The following
trends may occur as we continue to execute on our strategy: 

An
 increase in working capital requirements to finance organic growth; 

Addition
 of administrative and sales personnel as the business grows; 

Increases
 in advertising, public relations and sales promotions for existing and new brands as we expand within existing markets or enter new
 markets; 

A
 continuation of the costs associated with being a public company; and 

Capital
 expenditures to add technologies. 

Our
liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated
with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as amended, and
other rules implemented by the SEC. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations could significantly increase our legal and
financial compliance costs and increase the use of resources. 

As
of and for the quarter ended September 28, 2024, we had a working capital deficiency of 48,818, accumulated deficit of 134,426, and
a net loss of 2,844. 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate continuation as
a going concern. We have an unsecured payment due in the next 12 months associated with a historical acquisition and secured current
debt arrangements representing approximately 19,816 which are in excess of cash and cash equivalents on hand, in addition to funding
operational growth requirements. Historically, we have funded such payments either through cash flow from operations or the raising of
capital through additional debt or equity. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, such payments may not be made on time. These
factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments or classifications that may result from our possible inability to continue as a going concern. 

In
addition, as of September 28, 2024, we have numerous contractual lease obligations representing an aggregate of approximately 4,857
related to current lease agreements. We intend to fund the majority of these obligations through a combination of cash flow from operations,
as well as capital raised through additional debt or equity. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes hereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared
assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. Significant assumptions underlie this belief, including, among other things, that there will be no
material adverse developments in our business, liquidity, capital requirements and that our credit facilities with our lenders will remain
available to us.

Operating
activities 

For
the nine months ended September 28, 2024, net cash used in continuing operating activities of 549 was primarily attributable to
net loss of 7,370 an increase in accounts receivable of 1,744, a decrease in accounts payable of 1,552 and an increase in and
accrued payroll costs of 6,049. The net cash used in all operating activities was impacted by 3,007 from discontinued
operations to give a total cash used in operating activities of 3,556. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by continuing operating activities of 672 was primarily attributable to
net loss of 9,989, increases in Other Assets of 7,403 and the impact of non-cash items of 3,869. A negative impact of 11,397 for
discontinued operations brought the total cash used in operating activities to 10,725. 

Investing
activities 

For
the nine months ended September 28, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities totaled 1,993, primarily due to 2,046 related
discontinued operations offset by 53 purchase of property and equipment. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities totaled 4,718, primarily due to 138 purchase of
property and equipment and 4,856 related to discontinued operations. 

Financing
activities 

For
the nine months ended September 28, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities totaled 2,340, due to additional cash received of
 2,140 on accounts receivable financing, net, conversion of dividends on Series H preferred stock to principal 700 offset by payments made on earnouts 500. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities totaled 4,677 primarily due to repayments of
 3,139, net proceeds from the sale of common stock and a
warrant inducement transaction of 4,433 and 2,292, respectively, third party financing costs of 633 and discontinued operations of 256. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Refer
to the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 11, 2024 for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. There have been no
changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740), which establishes new income tax disclosure
requirements in addition to modifying and eliminating certain existing requirements. The new guidance requires consistent categorization
and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, as well as further disaggregation of income taxes paid. This change
is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. This change will apply on a prospective basis to annual financial
statements for periods beginning after the effective date. However, retrospective application in all prior periods presented is permitted.
The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its financial statements.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and that information is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the principal executive and financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, we identified a material weakness related to the lack of a sufficient complement of competent
finance personnel to appropriately account for, review and disclose the completeness and accuracy of transactions we entered into. Our
management has also identified a material weakness in our internal control over our goodwill assessment relating to the lack of a sufficient
process for determining the valuation of goodwill assets. 

Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Evaluation Date ), pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the
Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation
Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to the material weakness in our control environment and financial
reporting process discussed above. 

Management
believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects,
our financial condition as of the Evaluation Date, and results of our operations and cash flows for the Evaluation Date, in conformity
with GAAP. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control
that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

1A. Risk Factors. 

The
following description of risk factors includes any material changes to risk factors associated with our business, financial condition
and results of operations previously disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the
SEC on June 11, 2024. Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently
known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our
actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating
results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating
results, and stock price. 

The
following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other
statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated
financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements and Part I, Item 2, Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Risks
Relating to our Common Stock 

We
may not meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, which could result in a delisting of our common stock. 

As previously reported, on June 20, 2024, we received
a letter from the Staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the Staff indicating that we were no longer
in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement (the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which such rule requires listed companies to maintain stockholders 
equity of at least 2,500,000 or meet the alternative compliance standards relating to the market value of listed securities or net income
from continuing operations. 

46 

On
August 13, 2024, following the Staff s review of our plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement
submitted on June 14, 2024, and on August 5, 2024, we received a letter (the Notice indicating that the Staff determined
to deny our request for continued listing on Nasdaq. Pursuant to the Notice, based on the preliminary nature of our plan, the Staff determined
that we did not provide a definitive plan evidencing our ability to achieve near term compliance with the Minimum Stockholders 
Equity Requirement. We requested an appeal of the Staff s determination, and a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel was held on October 3, 2024. 

On
October 8, 2024, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel Panel indicating that the Panel determined to grant
our request to continue our listing on Nasdaq, subject to certain milestones being met on November 1, 2024, and December 31, 2024. 

Although
we expect to take actions intended to restore our compliance with the listing requirements, we can provide no assurance that any action
taken by us would be successful. If Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet Nasdaq s listing
standards for continued listing, an investor would likely find it significantly more difficult to dispose of or obtain our shares, and
our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our shares or issue our shares as consideration in acquisitions could be severely
limited. Additionally, we may not be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange, which could result in our
securities being quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, our stockholders could face significant material adverse
consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities.
Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional
investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

There
have been no unregistered sales of securities during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have not been previously
reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K. We have not made any purchases of our own securities during the time period covered by this
