 . As of September 27, 2024, there were outstanding borrowings under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility. The Second Amendment also provided for a new tranche of term loans maturing in 2030 (the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility ), the proceeds of which were primarily used, to repurchase a portion of the Company s common stock, pursuant to the certain Share Repurchase Agreement discussed in Note 14, as well as repay the 2023 Term Loan Facility. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility amortizes at a rate of per annum. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility bears interest, at the Company s option, at a rate equal to (i) Term SOFR in effect from time to time plus or (ii) the highest of (x) the Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus , (y) the prime lending rate or (z) the one-month Term SOFR plus in effect from time to time plus . The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility will mature on . The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility is subject to covenants consistent with the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement covenants. As the terms of the refinancing were not substantially different than the terms of the Second Amendment, the refinancing was accounted for as a debt modificatio n. In conjunction with the refinancing, the Company recognized as a debt discount which will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term using the effective interest method. Borrowings under the Second Amendment are collateralized by substantially all of the Company s assets. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of September 27, 2024 and March 29, 2024. A payment of was applied to the term loan balance on October 31, 2024, which has eliminated future required minimum quarterly payments. The balance of the loan is required to be paid upon the expected maturity date of October 31, 2030.

Effective tax rate 

The Company s (benefit) provision for income taxes is comprised of the year-to-date taxes based on an estimate of the annual effective tax rate plus the tax impact of discrete items. The Company is subject to tax in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company s effective income tax rate fluctuates primarily because of the change in the mix of its U.S. and foreign income, the impact of discrete transactions and law changes, tax benefits generated by the foreign derived intangible income deduction including the permanent impacts of Internal Revenue Code Section 174 Capitalization, and research credits; offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation and other charges. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three- and six-month periods results mainly from a decrease in forecasted US GAAP income before taxes, less tax deductions for share-based compensation, and an increase in nondeductible expenses primarily related to the Sanken Electric Co., Ltd. Sanken and Polar Semiconductor, LLC PSL transactions discussed in Note 14. 

shares of the Company s common stock from Sanken in a privately negotiated transaction at a price per share equal to the price per share at which the underwriters in a public underwritten equity offering of shares of our common stock would purchase the shares (the Equity Offering ). The repurchase of shares of common stock occurred in two separate closings, with the first closing taking place after the closing of the Equity Offering (the First Closing and the second closing occurring after the receipt of the proceeds from borrowings under the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility (the Second Closing ). The First Closing of the share repurchase was conditioned upon the closing of the Equity Offering and certain other conditions, and the Second Closing of the share repurchase was conditioned upon the receipt of net proceeds of no less than from incremental term loans under the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Repurchase Agreement, Sanken reimbursed the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Share Repurchase Agreement, and paid a facilitation fee of , which were recorded within additional paid-in-capital within the condensed consolidated statements of changes in equity. To fund the First Closing, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement with Barclays Capital Inc. and Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters (the Underwriters ), on July 24, 2024, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell shares of the Company s common stock, to the Underwriters at a price of per share. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional shares of Common Stock at the same purchase price, which option was exercised in full prior to the closing of the Equity Offering.

 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately , after deducting of underwriting discounts. As described above, the Company used the net proceeds of the Equity Offering to complete the First Closing under the Share Repurchase Agreement. On July 29, 20 24, the Company completed the First Closing under the Share Repurchase Agreement, repurchasing shares of the Company s common stock f or aggregate consideration of , which was the Equity Offering price, less the facilitation fee of , underwriting discounts, and reimbursable transaction expenses. The shares repurchased in the First Closing were retired. On August 7, 2024, the Company completed the Second Closing under the Share Repurchase Agreement, repurchasing shares of the Company s common stock for aggregate cash consideration of , which was the Equity Offering price, less underwriting discounts and reimbursable transaction expenses. As described above, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility and existing cash on hand to complete the Second Closing. The shares repurchased in the Second Closing were retired. The Share Repurchase Agreement was accounted for as a forward repurchase contract as there were certain terms that could have caused the obligation not to be fulfilled. Accordingly, the contract was initially recorded as a liability at its fair value with subsequent remeasurements recognized in loss on change in fair value of forward repurchase contract until the completion of the First Closing and Second Closing. The Company recognized a loss of as a result of the fair value forward repurchase contract in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the Share Repurchase Agreement, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement with Sanken (the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement ), which amended and restated the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated as of June 16, 2022, by and among the Company, Sanken and OEP SKNA, L.P. OEP ). The Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, which became effective in accordance with its terms on July 29, 2024, removed OEP as a party and amended certain rights and obligations of the Company and Sanken. Other transactions involving Sanken Although certain costs are shared or allocated, cost of goods sold and gross margins attributable to related party sales are consistent with those of third-party customers. There were trade accounts receivables, net, from Sanken as of September 27, 2024 or March 29, 2024. Other accounts receivable from Sanken totaled as of March 29, 2024. There were other accounts receivable from Sanken as of September 27, 2024. As of both September 27, 2024 and March 29, 2024, accounts payable to Sanken was not significant. As of September 27, 2024, Sanken held approximately of the Company s outstanding common stock. Transactions involving Polar Semiconductor, LLC PSL On April 25, 2024, the Company, Sanken, PSL and PS Investment Aggregator, L.P.

 Business Updates 
 On July 23, 2024, we entered into a share repurchase agreement (the Share Repurchase Agreement and the transaction thereunder, the Sanken Transaction with Sanken Electric Co., Ltd. Sanken ), pursuant to which we agreed to repurchase 38,767,315 shares of our common stock from Sanken at a price per share equal to the price per share at which the underwriters in a public underwritten equity offering of shares of our common stock would purchase shares (the Equity Offering ). The repurchase of shares of common stock occurred in two separate closings, with the first closing taking place after the closing of the Equity Offering (the First Closing and the second closing (the Second Closing occurring after the receipt of the proceeds from borrowings under the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility (as defined below). The First Closing of the share repurchase was conditioned upon the closing of the Equity Offering and certain other conditions, and the Second Closing of the share repurchase was conditioned upon the receipt of net proceeds of no less than 300.0 million from incremental term loans under the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Repurchase Agreement, Sanken reimbursed us for the expenses incurred by us in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Share Repurchase Agreement, plus a facilitation fee of 35.0 million. 
 To fund the First Closing, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement with Barclays Capital Inc. and Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters (the Underwriters on July 24, 2024, pursuant to which we agreed to sell 25,000,000 shares of our common stock, to the Underwriters at a price of 23.16 per share. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, we granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,750,000 shares of common stock at the same purchase price, which option was exercised in full prior to the closing of the Equity Offering. 
 20 

On July 26, 2024, we completed the Equity Offering pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement of 28,750,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 24.00 per share resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately 665.9 million, after deducting approximately 24.2 million of underwriting discounts. As described above, we used the net proceeds of the Equity Offering to complete the First Closing under the Share Repurchase Agreement. 
 On July 29, 2024, we completed the First Closing under the Share Repurchase Agreement, repurchasing 28,750,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate consideration of 628.3 million, which was the Equity Offering price, less the facilitation fee of 35.0 million, underwriting discounts, and reimbursable transaction expenses. The shares repurchased in the First Closing were retired. 
 In connection with the Share Repurchase Agreement, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement with Sanken (the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement ), which amended and restated the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated as of June 16, 2022, by and among us, Sanken and OEP SKNA, L.P. OEP ). The Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, which became effective in accordance with its terms on July 29, 2024, removed OEP as a party and amended certain rights and obligations of us and Sanken. 
 On August 6, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Second Amendment to the revolving credit facility credit agreement entered into on June 21, 2023 (as amended, the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement and the credit facility thereunder, as amended, the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility with Allegro MicroSystems, LLC, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as the administrative agent and the collateral agent, and each lender from time to time party thereto. The Second Amendment increased the total capacity of the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility to 256.0 million. 
 The Second Amendment also provided for a new 400 million tranche of term loans maturing in 2030 (the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility ), the proceeds of which were primarily used to (i) repurchase a portion of our common stock in connection with the Second Closing, (ii) refinance the 2023 Term Loan Facility (as defined in Note 9, Debt and Other Borrowings to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report), (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing and (iv) for general corporate purposes. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility amortizes at a rate of 1.00 per annum. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility bears interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement) in effect from time to time plus 2.25 or (ii) the highest of (x) the Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.50 , (y) the prime lending rate or (z) the one-month Term SOFR plus 1.0 in effect from time to time plus 1.25 . The 2023 Term Loan Refinancing will mature on October 31, 2030. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility is subject to covenants consistent with the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement covenants. As the terms of the refinancing were not substantially different than the terms of the Second Amendment, the refinancing was accounted for as a debt modification. In conjunction with the refinancing, we recognized 3.6 million as a debt discount which will amortized to interest expense over the remaining term using the effective interest method. Borrowings under the Second Amendment are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. 
 On August 7, 2024, we completed the Second Closing under the Share Repurchase Agreement, repurchasing 10,017,315 shares of our common stock for aggregate cash consideration of 225.5 million, which was the Equity Offering price less underwriting discounts and reimbursable transaction expenses. As described above, we used a portion of the proceeds from the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility and existing cash on hand to complete the Second Closing. The shares repurchased in the Second Closing were retired. 
 On September 20, 2024, we, along with Sanken, Polar Semiconductor LLC PSL ), and PS Investment Aggregator, L.P. Subscriber ), completed the transaction (the PSL Closing contemplated by a Sale and Subscription Agreement that we, Sanken, PSL and Subscriber entered into on April 25, 2024 (the PSL Agreement and the transaction thereunder, the PSL Transaction ). As contemplated by the PSL Agreement, Subscriber and certain of its affiliates agreed to make capital contributions to PSL of 175.0 million in exchange for an equity interest in PSL, and we agreed to discharge the PSL Promissory Notes (as defined in Note 14, Related Party Transactions to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report) held by us for a value of 10.4 million in exchange for PSL equity interests. Following the PSL Closing, we owned approximately 10.2 of PSL. As a result of the share issuance to Subscriber, we recognized a net loss of 2.8 million related to the difference between the selling price per share and its carrying amount per share and after a gain from the conversion of the PSL Promissory Notes. The loss is included in Other (expense) income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 At the PSL Closing, we, Sanken and Subscriber entered into an amended and restated limited partnership agreement (the Limited Partnership Agreement with Polar Semiconductor GP I, LLC. The Limited Partnership Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this type, the reimbursement of expenses and costs, and restrictions on transfers. 
 21 

Other Key Factors and Trends Affecting Our Operating Results 
 Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by numerous other factors and trends, including the following: 
 Inflation 
 Inflation rates in the markets in which we operate have increased and may continue to rise. Inflation over the last several quarters has led us to experience higher costs, including higher labor costs, wafer and other costs for materials from suppliers, and transportation and energy costs. Our suppliers have raised their prices and may continue to raise prices, and in the competitive markets in which we operate, we may not be able to make corresponding price increases to preserve our gross margins and profitability. If inflation rates continue to rise or remain elevated for a sustained period of time, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. While we have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as adjusting our selling prices and releasing new products with improved gross margins, our ability to increase our average selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. 
 Design Wins with New and Existing Customers 
 Our end customers continually develop new products in existing and new application areas, and we work closely with our significant original equipment manufacturer customers in most of our target markets to understand their product roadmaps and strategies. For new products, the time from design initiation and manufacturing until we generate sales can be lengthy, typically between two and four years. As a result, our future sales are highly dependent on our continued success at winning design mandates from our customers. Further, despite current inflationary conditions, we expect the average sales prices ASPs of our products to decline over time, and we consider design wins to be critical to our future success as they help mitigate declines in ASPs. We anticipate being increasingly dependent on revenue from newer design wins for our newer products. The selection process is typically lengthy and may require us to incur significant design and development expenditures in pursuit of a design win, with no assurance that our solutions will be selected. As a result, the loss of any key design win or any significant delay in the ramp-up of volume production of the customer s products into which our product is designed could adversely affect our business. In addition, volume production is contingent upon the successful introduction and market acceptance of our customers end products, which may be affected by several factors beyond our control. 
 Customer Demand, Orders and Forecasts 
 Demand for our products is highly dependent on market conditions in the end markets in which our customers operate, which are generally subject to seasonality, cyclicality and competitive conditions. In addition, a substantial portion of our total net sales is derived from sales to customers that purchase large volumes of our products. These customers generally provide periodic forecasts of their requirements. However, these forecasts do not commit such customers to minimum purchases, and customers can revise these forecasts without penalty. In addition, as is customary in the semiconductor industry, customers are generally permitted to cancel orders for our products within a specified period. Cancellations of orders could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses. In addition, changes in forecasts or the timing of orders from customers expose us to the risks of inventory shortages or excess inventory. We are currently operating in an inflationary environment for our products. 
 Manufacturing Costs and Product Mix 
 Gross margin has been, and will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors, including the ASPs of our products, product mix in a given period, material costs, yields, manufacturing costs and efficiencies. We believe the primary driver of gross margin is the ASP negotiated between us and our customers relative to material costs and yields. Our pricing and margins depend on the volumes and the features of the products we produce and sell to our customers. As our products mature and unit volumes increase, we expect their ASPs to decline in the long term. We continually monitor and work to reduce the cost of our products and improve the potential value our solutions provide to our customers, as we target new design win opportunities and manage the product life cycles of our existing customer designs. We also maintain a close relationship with our suppliers and subcontractors to improve quality, increase yields and lower manufacturing costs. As a result, these declines often coincide with improvements in manufacturing yields and lower wafer, assembly, and testing costs, which offset some or all of the margin reduction that results from declining ASPs. However, we expect our gross margin to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of changes in ASPs due to product mix, new product introductions, transitions into volume manufacturing and manufacturing costs. Gross margin generally decreases if production volumes are lower as a result of decreased demand as it did in the first quarter, which leads to a reduced absorption of our fixed manufacturing costs. Gross margin generally increases when the opposite occurs. 
 22 

Cyclical Nature of the Semiconductor Industry 
 The semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and is characterized by increasingly rapid technological change, product obsolescence, competitive pricing pressures, evolving standards, short product life cycles in consumer and other rapidly changing markets and fluctuations in product supply and demand. New technology may result in sudden changes in system designs or platform changes that may render some of our products obsolete and require us to devote significant research and development resources to compete effectively. Periods of rapid growth and capacity expansion are occasionally followed by significant market corrections in which sales decline, inventories accumulate, and facilities go underutilized. During periods of expansion, our margins generally improve as fixed costs are spread over higher manufacturing volumes and unit sales. In addition, we may build inventory to meet increasing market demand for our products during these times, which serves to absorb fixed costs further and increase our gross margins. During an expansion cycle, we may increase capital spending and hiring to add to our production capacity. During periods of slower growth or industry contractions, our sales, production and productivity and margins generally decline. 
 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
 Pursuant to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, beginning in fiscal year 2023, U.S. tax law now requires us to capitalize and amortize domestic and foreign research and development expenditures over five and 15 years, for domestic and foreign research, respectively 174 Capitalization ). The impact of 174 Capitalization for fiscal year 2025 is an increase in annual cash taxes of approximately 5.0 million and a foreign derived intangible income benefit of 5.5 million. Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service has issued Notice 2024-12 and is expected to issue final guidance which may modify this law or change its impact.

 Total net sales 
 Total net sales decreased in the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 29, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by an overall reduction in customer held inventory and corresponding to a decline in shipments across all end markets. The decline in shipments impacted all applications, including e-Mobility products, safety comfort and convenience applications, and broad-based and other industrial applications, including clean energy and automation, and data center applications, partially offset by an increase in smart home applications.

Cost of goods sold 
 Cost of goods sold decreased in the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to a reduction in shipped volume, as well as change in product mix, partially offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets in relation to the acquisition of Crocus Technology International Corp. Crocus ). 
 Cost of goods sold as a percentage of our total net sales was 54.3 and 42.1 for the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the reduction in production volume, as well as a change in product mix noted above.

 Gross margin was 45.7 and 57.9 for the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the decline in net sales and product mix noted above. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development R D expenses increased in the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 in comparison to the comparable period in fiscal year 2024, primarily due to the increase in R D supplies, partially offset by a reduction from R D tax credits and personnel costs, including the annual incentive program. 
 R D expenses as a percentage of our total net sales was 23.2 and 15.8 for the three-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the increase in R D supplies, partially offset by reduction from R D tax credits and personnel costs including the annual incentive program, in addition to the decline in net sales. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses decreased in the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the annual incentive program and outside service costs, partially offset by an increase in personnel and severance expenses.

The increase as a percentage of total net sales was primarily due to a decrease in the annual incentive program and outside service costs, partially offset by an increase in personnel and severance expenses in addition to the decline in net sales. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased in the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 29, 2023, due to higher interest payments on the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility, which increased our total outstanding debt balance. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income decreased in the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalent balances. 
 Loss on change in fair value of forward repurchase contract 
 We recorded a loss on the change in fair value of a forward repurchase contract in the three-month period ended September 27, 2024, due to the various settlement dates under the Share Repurchase Agreement. 
 Other (expense) income, net 
 The foreign currency gain recorded in the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Philippine Peso. The foreign currency gain recorded in the three-month period ended September 29, 2023, was primarily due to realized and unrealized gains from the British Pound strengthening against the Euro in our United Kingdom location, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Philippine Peso. 
 We also recorded a net loss of 2.8 million as a result of the PSL Closing in the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 related to the difference between the selling price per share and its carrying amount per share and after a gain from the conversion of the PSL Promissory notes. Unrealized losses of 2.3 million related to our investment in marketable securities were offset by 3.7 million of gains related to sales of our investment in marketable securities and earnings in our money market fund deposits in the three-month period ended September 29, 2023.

Income tax (benefit) provision 
 Income tax benefit and the effective income tax rate were (8.4) million and 14.1 , respectively, in the six-month period ended September 27, 2024, compared to income tax provision and effective income tax rate of 14.6 million and 10.4 , respectively, in the six-month period ended September 29, 2023. The increase in the ETR was mainly due to a decrease in forecasted GAAP income before taxes, less tax deductions for share-based compensation, and an increase in nondeductible expenses primarily related to the Sanken Transaction and PSL Transaction. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 27, 2024, we had 188.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and 399.6 million of working capital, compared to 212.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and 454.3 million of working capital as of March 29, 2024. Working capital is impacted by the timing and extent of our business needs. 
 On August 6, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment increased the total capacity of the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility to 256 million and provided for a new 400 million Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility, the proceeds of which were used, in relevant part to (i) repurchase a portion of our common stock, (ii) refinance the 2023 Term Loan Facility, (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing and (iv) for general corporate purposes. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility amortizes at a rate of 1.00 per annum. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility bears interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect from time to time plus 2.25 or (ii) the highest of (x) the Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.50 , (y) the prime lending rate or (z) the one-month Term SOFR plus 1.0 in effect from time to time plus 1.25 . The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility will mature on October 31, 2030. 
 Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital resources besides our growth initiatives are working capital, capital expenditures, principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt, and other general corporate needs. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through cash provided by operating activities and cash and cash equivalents. Our current capital deployment strategy for fiscal year 2025 is to utilize cash on hand and capacity under our 2023 Revolving Credit Facility to support our continued growth initiatives into select markets and planned capital expenditures, as well as consider potential acquisitions. As of September 27, 2024, the Company was not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. The cash requirements for the upcoming fiscal year relate to our operating leases, operating and capital purchase commitments, and expected contributions to our defined benefit and contribution plans. Additionally, we expect to continue to strategically invest in expanding our operations in China, Europe, Japan and India in order to directly manage and service our customers in these markets, which could result in increases in our total net sales, cost of goods sold and operating expenses. For information regarding the Company s expected cash requirements and timing of payments related to leases, noncancellable purchase commitments and pension and defined contribution plans, see Note 12, Leases, Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15, Retirement Plans to the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company s 2024 Annual Report. 
 We believe that our existing cash will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy, planned capital expenditures and the additional expenses that we expect to incur during the next 12 months. In order to support and achieve our future growth plans, we may need or advantageously seek to obtain additional funding through equity or debt financing. We believe that our current operating structure will facilitate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our expected long-term liquidity requirements beyond the next 12 months. If these resources are not sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements due to changes in circumstances, we may be required to borrow under our 2023 Revolving Credit Facility or seek additional financing. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities that are not used to repurchase existing shares outstanding, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may contain covenants that significantly restrict our operations or our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future. Any additional financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us or our existing stockholders, or at all.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 49.7 million in the six-month period ended September 27, 2024, resulting primarily from a net loss of 51.2 million and noncash charges of 93.2 million, further adjusted by a net increase in cash from a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 7.7 million. Noncash charges include increases for 34.8 million for loss on change in fair value of forward repurchase contract, 32.5 million of depreciation and amortization, 21.7 million of stock-based compensation and 6.6 million of other non-cash reconciling items, partially offset by 7.8 million of deferred income taxes. The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities consisted of a 41.4 million decrease in trade accounts receivable, net, a 13.7 million increase in trade accounts payable and a 4.1 million increase in net amounts due to related party partially offset by an 18.8 million increase in inventories, a 15.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a 16.8 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities. The decrease in trade accounts receivable, net was primarily a result of decreased sales year-over-year. Trade accounts payable increased primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers and vendors, including unpaid capital expenditures of 4.1 million. The increase in net amounts due to related parties was primarily due to variations in the timing of such payments in the ordinary course of business. The increase in inventories was primarily the result of inventory builds of standard products to support anticipated sales growth. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was mostly due to higher long-term deposits and the timing of tax payments. The decrease in accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities was primarily the result of a reduction in accrued personnel costs due to the timing of payments pursuant to our annual incentive compensation plan. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 96.4 million in the six-month period ended September 29, 2023, resulting primarily from net income of 126.6 million and noncash charges of 46.3 million, partially offset by a net decrease in cash from an increase in net operating assets and liabilities of 76.5 million. The net increase in operating assets and liabilities consisted of a 31.2 million increase in inventories, a 29.9 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities, a 16.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a 7.6 million increase in trade accounts receivable, net, partially offset by a 2.7 million increase in trade accounts payable and a 6.1 million increase in net amounts due from related parties. The increase in inventories was primarily the result of inventory builds to support anticipated sales growth for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets were mostly due to higher long-term deposits and the timing of tax payments, including value-added taxes receivable, insurance and contract costs. The decrease in accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities was primarily the result of a reduction in accrued personnel costs due to timing of payments pursuant to our annual incentive compensation plan. The increase in trade accounts receivable, net, was primarily a result of increased sales year-over-year, as well as timing of receipts. Accounts payable increased primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers and vendors, partially offset by higher operating purchases, including unpaid capital expenditures of 20.0 million. The increase in net amounts due to related parties was primarily due to variations in the timing of such payments in the ordinary course of business. 
 Investing Activities

 See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2024 Annual Report. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since March 29, 2024. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There have not been any material changes in our exposures to market risk since March 29, 2024. For details on the Company s interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and inflation risks, see Part I, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Information About Market Risks in our 2024 Annual Report. 
 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 27, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 27, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Amendment to Chief Executive Officer Employment Agreement 
 On October 31, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the Amendment to the employment agreement, dated May2, 2022, between the Company and Vineet Nargolwala, the Company s Chief Executive Officer (the CEO Employment Agreement ). The Amendment was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board at the recommendation of the Board s Compensation Committee (the Committee following a comprehensive market review by the Committee of all the Company s executive severance arrangements and based on advice and recommendations from the Committee s independent compensation consultant. 
 The Amendment revised the severance amount under the CEO Employment Agreement that would apply in the case of a termination without cause or resignation for good reason outside of a change in control CIC scenario from 2.0 times base salary (and a pro-rated target level bonus for the year of termination) and up to 12 months of health care continuation payments to 2.0 times base salary plus target annual bonus (and a pro-rated target level bonus for the year of termination) and up to 18 months of health care continuation payments. The Amendment does not change the severance amount under the CEO Employment Agreement that would apply in the case of termination without cause or resignation for good reason within 24 months after the occurrence of a CIC, which remains at a 2.0 times base salary plus target annual bonus and up to 24 months of health care continuation payments. The Amendment also specifies that the CIC protection period, during which termination without cause or resignation for good reason would trigger full equity award vesting acceleration is 24 months following the occurrence of a CIC, notwithstanding the fact that this period is 12 months in Mr. Nargolwala s outstanding equity award agreements. 
 The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Amendment, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.5 to this Quarterly Report and incorporated by reference herein. 
 Amendments to Other Executive Severance Arrangements 
 As a result of the market review by the Committee, the Committee also authorized the Company to modify the Company s standard form of executive severance agreement to be entered into with any new executive officers going forward (the New Severance Agreement ). The New Severance Agreement would provide that in the case of termination without cause or resignation for good reason of the relevant officer, he or she would receive severance payments equal to 1.0 times base salary plus target annual bonus (and a pro-rated target level bonus for the year of termination). The New Severance Agreement also adds a Section 280G best net benefit provision, which provides that if the executive s total payments and benefits in connection with a CIC transaction Total Payments would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Excise Tax ), such Total Payments would be reduced solely to the extent necessary to ensure that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax (the Reduced Payments ), but only if such Reduced Payments would be larger than the original Total Payments to the executive on an after-tax basis. Consistent with our current policies and agreements, none of our executive officers would be entitled to receive any gross up payments on account of any Excise Tax. 
 32 

The New Severance Agreement does not amend the severance agreements that the Company has previously entered into with its executive officers (other than Mr. Nargolwala), would only be used for newly hired or promoted executives going forward and has not yet been entered into with any individual officers. 
 To further align with current market practice, the Committee also authorized the Company to amend all of the Company s outstanding executive restricted stock unit and performance stock unit award agreements to increase the CIC protection period from 12 to 24 months following a CIC event, where a termination without cause or resignation for good reason during such period would trigger full equity award vesting acceleration.
