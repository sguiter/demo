 (In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages or as otherwise noted) 

On January 25, 2024, the Company redeemed its Series B common membership interests (the Interests in FG Holdings LLC and withdrew from FG Holdings LLC. In exchange for the Interests, the Company received shares of the Company s Common Stock, with an approximate fair value of on the date of the transaction and recorded a realized loss of on the investment during the first quarter of 2024. The shares received by the Company are held as treasury stock, increasing the total number of treasury shares held by the Company to . 

million (the Line of Credit ). On November 22, 2023, the IPSA was renewed for one more year. The Company used funds obtained from the Line of Credit to replace the JPMC Credit Agreement (defined below) (see Note 12 ). The IPSA was paid off in September 2024. On October 30, 2024, the Company entered into a new line of credit agreement with Fifth Third Bank, N.A. (see Note 14 ). Management believes that cash and cash equivalents currently available, combined with anticipated cash to be generated from operations, and borrowing ability are sufficient to meet the Company s working capital requirements in the foreseeable future. The Company generally relies on cash from operations, commercial debt, and equity offerings to the extent available, to satisfy its liquidity needs and to meet its payment obligations. The Company may engage in public or private offerings of equity or debt securities to maintain or increase its liquidity and capital resources. However, financial and economic conditions, including those resulting from the current inflationary environment and current geopolitical tension, could impact our ability to raise capital or debt financing, if needed, on acceptable terms or at all. 

per share (the Common Stock ), and on April 4, 2023, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada a Certificate of Change to its Articles of Incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split. The Company executed the Reverse Stock Split, which became effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on April 21, 2023. Shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding stock options and restricted stock units were proportionately reduced, and the respective exercise prices were proportionately increased in accordance with the terms of the agreements governing such securities. Accordingly, all shares and per share amounts for all periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted, where applicable, to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. 

shares of the Company s common stock (the BKTI Stock for an investment of . The number of shares of BKTI Stock was determined based upon a price per share of , which is equal to the average of the closing price of BKTI Stock on the NYSE American for the 30 most recent trading days prior to November 6, 2023, rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares. 
 
 Additionally, East West purchased a warrant Warrant ), with a five -year term to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price per share of . The consideration for the Warrant is payment equal to (a) One Million Dollars minus (b) (i) the amount of any outstanding accounts payable by Company to East West and (ii) the amount of any excess or obsolete inventory of Company currently held by East West (solely to the extent not otherwise taken into account pursuant to the MSA or any other agreement between the Company and East West). The payment included a reduction in accounts payable and in cash. The BKTI Stock, the Warrant and the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant are deemed to be issued to an accredited investor in a private placement exempt from the registration pursuant to Section 4 (a)( 2 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

and on gross trade receivables of and as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The measurement and recognition of credit losses involves the use of judgment and represents management s estimate of expected lifetime credit losses based on historical experience and trends, current conditions, and forecasts. The Company s assessment of expected credit losses includes consideration of historical credit loss experience, the aging of account balances, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, and current and expected economic, market and industry factors affecting the Company s customers, including their financial condition. The Company evaluates its experience with historical losses and then applies this historical loss ratio to financial assets with similar characteristics. Based on information available, management believes the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is adequate. 

Work in process 
 Raw materials 

Allowances for slow-moving, excess, or obsolete inventory are used to state the Company s inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The allowances were approximately as of September 30, 2024 , compared with approximately as of December 31, 2023 . 

and tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. The Company recorded no tax expense or benefit for the same periods last year. 
 
 The Company s income tax provision is based on management s estimate of the effective tax rate for the full year. The tax provision (benefit) in any period will be affected by, among other things, permanent, as well as temporary, differences in the deductibility of certain items, changes in the valuation allowance related to net deferred tax assets, in addition to changes in tax legislation. As a result, the Company may experience significant fluctuations in the effective book tax rate (that is, tax expense divided by pre-tax book income) from period to period. 

As of September 30, 2024 , the Company s net deferred tax assets totaled approximately and were primarily derived from research and development tax credits, deferred revenue, and net operating loss carryforwards. The utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in a given year is limited. 
 
 In order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets, the Company will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years. The Company analyzed all positive and negative evidence to determine if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets. The recognition of the net deferred tax assets and related tax benefits is based upon the Company s conclusions regarding, among other considerations, estimates of future earnings based on information currently available and current and anticipated customers, contracts, and product introductions, as well as historical operating results and certain tax planning strategies. 
 
 Based on the analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has concluded that it does not have the ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the necessary period to utilize the entire benefit for the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, the Company established a valuation allowance of and as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. If the Company incurs future losses, it may be necessary to record additional valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets recognized as of September 30, 2024. 

and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. 

shares of the Company s Common Stock, with an approximate fair value of on the date of the transaction and recorded a realized loss of on the investment during the first quarter of 2024. The shares received by the Company are held as treasury stock, increasing the total number of treasury shares held by the Company to . 
 
 The investment in the Series B common membership interests of FG Holdings LLC was measured using the NAV practical expedient in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement and has not been classified within the fair value hierarchy. Prior to the redemption, FG Holdings LLC invested in the common and preferred stock of Fundamental Global Inc. (Nasdaq: FGF) FGF ). FG Holdings LLC s structure provided for Series A preferred interests, which accrued a return of eight percent per annum and receive of positive profits with respect to the total return in the capital provided by the holders of Series A preferred membership interests. The Series B common membership interests received cumulative distributions equal to the aggregate capital contributions by the Series B common membership interest equal to the total return on capital provided by the Series B common membership interests. Series B common membership interests also received an additional return equal to times the Series A of positive profits described above. There was no defined redemption frequency, and the Company could not redeem or transfer its investment without the prior written consent of FG Holdings LLC' managers, who were related parties. Distributions could be made to members at such times and amounts as determined by the managers, and were based on the most recent NAV. The Company did not have any unfunded commitments related to this investment. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023 , the members and affiliates of FG Holdings LLC beneficially owned in the aggregate shares of FGF's common stock, representing approximately of FGF's outstanding shares. Additionally, FG Holdings LLC and its affiliates constituted the largest stockholder of the Company. Mr. Kyle Cerminara, who served as a director of the Company and chairman of the Board of Directors until December 14, 2023, is Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder, and Partner of FG and serves as chairman of the board of directors of FG Group Holdings Inc., the entity that is a majority Series B member in FG Holdings LLC. Mr. Cerminara also serves as a manager of FG Holdings, LLC and chairman of the board of directors of FGF.

The Company considers its non-cash share-based employee compensation expenses as a component of cost of products and selling, general and administrative expenses. There was no non-cash share-based employee compensation expense capitalized as part of capital expenditures or inventory for the periods presented. 
 
 The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock option grants under this plan.

 Geopolitical Tensions and COVID- 19 
 
 U.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, and in the Middle East. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflicts is highly unpredictable, the conflict in both of these regions could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions. While the impacts of COVID- 19 are reflected in our results of operations for 2023 , we cannot separate the direct COVID- 19 impacts from other factors that cause our performance to vary from quarter to quarter. The ultimate duration and impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on our supply chain and geopolitical factors to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration and severity of the geopolitical factors on the global economy, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.

Table of Contents 

In business for over 70 years, BK operates two business units through its operating subsidiary, BK Technologies, Inc.: Radio and SaaS. 
 
 The Radio business unit designs, manufactures, and markets wireless communications products consisting of two-way LMRs. Two-way LMRs can be radios that are hand-held (portable) or installed in vehicles (mobile). 
 
 Generally, BK Technologies-branded products serve the government markets, including, but not limited to, emergency response, public safety, homeland security, and military customers of federal, state, and municipal government agencies, as well as various industrial and commercial enterprises. We believe that our products and solutions provide superior value by offering a high specification, ruggedized, durable, reliable, feature-rich, Project 25-compliant radio at a lower cost relative to comparable offerings. 
 
 The SaaS business unit focuses on delivering innovative, public safety smartphone applications that operate ubiquitously over public cellular networks. We presently have one U.S. patent in force and two pending U.S. patent applications. Our BKRplay-branded smartphone application offers multiple services that make first responders safer and more efficient. When tethered to our radios, the combined solution will offer a unique capability which increases the sales reach of our radios. 
 
 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 24, 1997. We are the corporation resulting from the reincorporation merger of our predecessor, Adage, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, which reincorporated from Pennsylvania to Nevada effective as of January 30, 1998. Effective on June 4, 2018, we changed our corporate name from RELM Wireless Corporation to BK Technologies, Inc. 
 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 7100 Technology Drive, West Melbourne, Florida 32904, and our telephone number is (321) 984-1414. 
 
 Customer demand and orders for our products were strong during fiscal year 2023 and continued during the first nine months of 2024. Our backlog of unshipped customer orders was approximately 27.0 million and 16.0 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Changes in the backlog are attributed primarily to the timing of orders and their fulfillment. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, sales increased approximately 0.5 to approximately 20.2 million, compared with 20.1 million for the prior year period. The increase was attributed primarily to the shipments of BKR 5000 radio product sales. Gross profit margins as a percentage of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 38.8 , compared with 31.9 for the prior comparative quarter, generally reflecting radio product and accessories sales mix and material cost improvements related to cost reduction initiatives. Selling, general, and administrative SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled approximately 5.2 million (25.9 of sales), compared with 5.8 million (29.0 of sales) in the same period last year. We recognized operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, of approximately 2.6 million, compared with an operating income of approximately 0.1 million for the same period for the prior year. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized other expenses, net totaling less than seven thousand dollars. This compares with other expenses, net totaling 0.5 million for the same period last year, which included an unrealized loss on the investment in FG Holdings LLC and interest expense on the Alterna IPSA Line of Credit. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the pretax income totaled approximately 2.6 million, compared with pretax income of approximately 0.1 million for same period of the prior year. 
 
 We recognized a tax expense of 247 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and no tax expense for the same period of the prior year.

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled approximately 2.4 million 0.67 per basic and 0.63 per diluted share), compared with a net income of approximately 0.1 million 0.03 per basic and diluted share) for the same period last year. The primary factors for the improvement for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, were radio product and accessories sales mix and lower raw material and freight costs related to cost reduction efforts and easing of electronic component shortages from supply chain disruptions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, working capital totaled approximately 22.7 million, of which 13.5 million was comprised of cash, cash equivalents, and trade receivables. This compares with working capital totaling approximately 16.8 million at 2023 year-end, which included 11.4 million of cash, cash equivalents, and trade receivables.

Third Quarter and Nine Months Summary 
 
 Customer demand and new orders for our products of 21.8 million continued to be strong during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 19.6 million for the same period of the prior year. Customer demand and orders for our products of 72.4 million continued to be strong during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 54.1 million for the same period of the prior year. 
 
 For the third quarter 2024, sales increased 0.5 to approximately 20.2 million, compared with approximately 20.1 million of sales for the third quarter last year. Sales of approximately 58.7 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, increased 1.5 compared with approximately 57.8 million of sales for the same period last year. Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately 38.8 , compared with 31.9 for the same period last year, generally reflecting radio product and accessories sales mix and material cost improvements related to cost reduction initiatives compared to the third quarter last year. Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 36.9 , compared with 28.6 for the same period last year, generally reflecting radio product and accessories sales mix and material cost improvements related to cost reduction initiatives. Selling, general, and administrative SG A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 totaled approximately 5.2 million, which was 10.1 lower than the SG A expenses of approximately 5.8 million for the third quarter last year, while SG A expenses of 16.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, decreased 9.2 compared to the same period last year. The decrease in SG A expenses is attributed primarily to capitalization of BKR Mobile radio product development costs in 2024 and marketing initiatives for the BKR 9000 product in 2023. These factors yielded operating income of approximately 2.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with operating income of approximately 0.1 million for the same period last year. Operating income of approximately 5.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compares to an operating loss of 1.2 million for the same period last year, related to radio product and accessories sales mix, material cost improvements related to cost reduction initiatives and supply chain challenges for the same period last year. 
 
 For the third quarter of 2023, we recognized a net unrealized loss of approximately 0.3 million on the investment in FG Holdings, LLC, that was exited during the first quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net realized loss totaling approximately 0.1 million on our investment in FG Holdings, LLC. compared with a net unrealized loss of approximately 0.8 million for the same nine-month period last year. For the third quarter of 2024, we recognized net interest expense of one thousand dollars compared to 0.1 million for the same period last year, while for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net interest expense of 0.3 million compared to 0.4 million for the same period last year. 
 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 2.4 million 0.67 per basic and 0.63 per diluted share), compared with net income of approximately 0.1 million 0.03 per basic and diluted share) for the same quarter last year.

Net Sales 
 
 For the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, net sales increased 0.5 to approximately 20.2 million, compared with approximately 20.1 million for the same quarter last year. Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled approximately 58.7 million, compared with approximately 57.8 million for the nine-month period last year. Customer demand and orders for our products continued to be strong, reflecting the acceptance by the marketplace for our BKR 5000, as well as BKR 9000 product introduced in 2023. 
 
 Sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, were attributed primarily to federal wildland fire-related agencies and certain state and local public safety opportunities. From a product perspective, the primary contributor to orders and shipments during the third quarter was our BKR 5000 portable radio and related accessories. The BKR Series is envisioned as a comprehensive line of new products, which includes new models such as the BKR 9000, which achieved first sales in the third quarter of 2023. The timing of developing additional BKR Series products and bringing them to market could be impacted by various factors, including potential impacts on our supply chain as a result of various electronic component suppliers. We believe that the BKR Series products should increase our addressable market by expanding the number of federal and other public safety customers that may purchase our products. However, the timing and size of orders from agencies at all levels can be unpredictable and subject to budgets, priorities, and other factors. Accordingly, we cannot assure that sales will occur under particular contracts, or that our sales prospects will otherwise be realized. 
 
 While the potential impacts of the current inflationary environment and ongoing geopolitical conflict and related sanctions in coming months and quarters remain uncertain, such effects have the potential to adversely impact our customers and our supply chain. Such negative effects on our customers and suppliers could adversely affect our future sales, gross profit margins, operations, and financial results. 
 
 Cost of Products and Gross Profit Margin 
 
 Gross profit margins as a percentage of sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, were approximately 38.8 compared with 31.9 for the same quarter last year. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, gross profit margins were approximately 36.9 , compared with 28.6 for the same period last year. Our cost of products and gross profit margins are primarily derived from material, labor, and overhead costs, product mix, manufacturing volumes and pricing. Gross profit margins for the quarter and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, increased compared with the same period last year, primarily due to product sales mix and improvement in material costs, including electronic components and to a lesser degree, easing of escalated freight costs. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, worldwide shortages of materials, including semiconductors and integrated circuits resulted in limited supplies, which in turn, extended lead times and resulted in higher costs for certain components used in our products. While the progression and duration of these shortages is not known with certainty, we monitored a number of critical components for product cost improvement and have experienced improvement to pre-pandemic levels. We utilize a combination of internal manufacturing capabilities and contract manufacturing relationships for production efficiencies and to manage material and labor costs. We believe that our current manufacturing capabilities and contract relationships or comparable alternatives will continue to be available to us. However, we may encounter new product cost and competitive pricing pressures in the future and the extent of their impact on gross margins, if any, is uncertain.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 SG A expenses consist of marketing, sales, commissions, engineering, product development, management information systems, accounting, headquarters, and non-cash share-based employee compensation expenses. 
 
 SG A expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, totaled approximately 5.2 million (25.9 of sales), compared with approximately 5.8 million (29.0 of sales) for the same quarter last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A expenses decreased by 1.6 million, or 9.2 , to approximately 16.1 million (27.4 of sales), compared with approximately 17.7 million (30.6 of sales), for the nine-month period last year. 
 
 Engineering and product development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 totaled approximately 1.9 million (9.2 of sales), compared with approximately 2.5 million (12.5 of sales) for the same quarter last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, engineering and product development expenses totaled approximately 5.9 million (10.1 of sales), compared with approximately 7.5 million (13.0 of sales) for the nine-month period last year. The decrease in engineering expenses is attributed primarily to capitalization of BKR Mobile radio product design and development activities in 2024, and somewhat to development costs in 2023 for the BKR 9000 series radio introduced during the third quarter 2023. Most of these activities were being performed by our internal engineering team and were their primary focus, combined with sustaining engineering support for our existing products. The precise date for developing and introducing new products is uncertain and can be impacted by, among other things, supply chain shortages and certain component lead times in coming months and quarters. 
 
 Marketing and selling expenses for the third quarter of 2024 totaled approximately 1.4 million (7.2 of sales), compared with approximately 1.5 million (7.5 of sales) for the third quarter last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, marketing and selling expenses remained flat at approximately 4.6 million (7.9 of sales), compared with the same period last year. 
 
 Other general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 totaled approximately 1.9 million (9.4 of sales), compared with approximately 1.8 million (9.0 of sales) for the same period last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately 5.5 million (9.4 of sales), compared with approximately 5.6 million (9.7 of sales) for the nine-month period last year. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, is attributed primarily to the non-recurring nature of certain corporate expenses related to the At-the-Market (ATM) program and reverse stock split during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Operating Income (Loss) 
 
 Operating income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, totaled approximately 2.6 million (12.9 of sales), compared with operating income of approximately 0.6 million (3.0 of sales) for last year s third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating income totaled approximately 5.6 million (9.6 of sales), compared with an operating loss of approximately 1.2 million (2.0 of sales) for the nine-month period last year. The operating income improvement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods last year, is attributed to higher gross profit margins related to improved product sales mix and lower material costs due to cost reduction efforts and supply chain improvements. 
 
 Other (Expense) Income 
 
 We recorded net interest expense of approximately one thousand dollars for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared with approximately 0.1 million for the third quarter last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest expense totaled approximately 0.3 million, compared with net interest expense of approximately 0.4 million for the nine-month period last year. Net interest expense was primarily the result of our Alterna IPSA Line of Credit.

Table of Contents 

On January 25, 2024, the Company redeemed its Series B common membership interests (the Interests of FG Holdings LLC and withdrew from FG Holdings LLC. In exchange for its Interests, the Company received 52,000 shares of our Common Stock, with an approximate fair value of 0.7 million on the date of the transaction and recorded a realized loss of 0.1 million on the investment during the first quarter of 2024. The Company recorded an unrealized loss of 0.3 million and 0.8 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The shares received by the Company are held as treasury stock, increasing the total number of treasury shares held by the Company to 342,080. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 We recorded 0.2 million and 0.5 million tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recorded no tax expense or benefit for the same periods last year. 
 
 The Company's income tax provision is based on management s estimate of the effective tax rate for the full year. The tax provision (benefit) in any period will be affected by, among other things, permanent, as well as temporary, differences in the deductibility of certain items, in addition to changes in tax legislation. As a result, we may experience significant fluctuations in the effective book tax rate (that is, tax expense divided by pre-tax book income) from period to period. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our net deferred tax assets totaled approximately 4.1 million and were primarily derived from research and development tax credits, operating loss carryforwards, and deferred revenue. 
 
 In order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets, we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years. We analyze all positive and negative evidence to determine if, based on the weight of available evidence, we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets. The recognition of the net deferred tax assets and related tax benefits is based upon our conclusions regarding, among other considerations, estimates of future earnings based on information currently available and current and anticipated customers, contracts, and product introductions, as well as historical operating results and certain tax planning strategies. 
 
 Based on our analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, we have concluded that we do not have the ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the necessary period to utilize the entire benefit for the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we established a valuation allowance of 4.4 million and 4.4 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. We cannot presently estimate what, if any, changes to the valuation of our deferred tax assets may be deemed appropriate in the future. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately 8.2 million, compared with cash provided by operating activities of approximately 3.9 million for the same period last year. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily related to net income of 4.7 million and a 5.3 million reduction in inventory, somewhat offset by a 1.6 million increase in accounts receivable and a 3.9 million decrease in accounts payable. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily related to an increase in deferred revenues and a reduction in accounts receivable, which was partially offset by net loss due to supply chain issues and decrease in accounts payable. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, we had net income of approximately 4.7 million, compared with a net loss of approximately 2.5 million for the same period last year. Accounts receivable increased approximately 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a decrease of approximately 1.5 million for the same period last year, primarily due to increased sales in the first nine months of 2024. Inventories decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, by approximately 5.3 million compared with a decrease of approximately 0.6 million for the same period last year. Accounts payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased approximately 3.9 million, compared with a decrease of approximately 1.1 million for the first nine months last year. The decreases in inventories and accounts payable were attributed primarily to improvement of supply chain challenges from fiscal year 2022 and early fiscal 2023. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased during the first nine months of 2024 by approximately 0.8 million compared with an increase of 0.4 million for the same period last year. Depreciation and amortization totaled approximately 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with approximately 1.2 million for the same period last year. Depreciation and amortization are primarily related to manufacturing and engineering equipment. The realized loss on investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled approximately 0.1 million, compared with an unrealized loss of approximately 0.8 million for the same period last year. For additional information pertaining to our investments, refer to Note 1 and Note 7 (Investments) to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled approximately 0.9 million, compared with approximately 1.8 million for the same period last year. The cash used for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was attributed primarily to the development of the BKR mobile radio product, compared to cash used for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, attributed primarily to the purchase of engineering and manufacturing related equipment. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 6.6 million was used in financing activities, compared with cash provided by financing activities of approximately 0.1 million for the same period last year. During the first nine months of 2024, we received cash of approximately 46.4 million from our revolving credit facility and notes payable, net of repayments totaling approximately 53.0 million, while for the same period last year, we received proceeds of approximately 58.9 million from our revolving credit facility and notes payable offset by loan and revolving credit facility repayments of approximately 58.9 million. 
 
 Our cash and cash equivalents balance on September 30, 2024, was approximately 4.2 million. We believe these funds, combined with anticipated cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our Fifth Third Line of Credit, are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We may, depending on a variety of factors, including market conditions for capital raises, the trading price of our common stock and opportunities for uses of any proceeds, engage in public or private offerings of equity or debt securities to increase our capital resources. However, financial and economic conditions, which could be impacted by the current inflationary environment and current geopolitical tension, could limit our access to credit and impair our ability to raise capital, if needed, on acceptable terms or at all. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 In response to the SEC s financial reporting release, FR-60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, we have selected for disclosure our revenue recognition process and our accounting processes involving significant judgments, estimates and assumptions. These processes affect our reported revenues and current assets and are, therefore, critical in assessing our financial and operating status. We regularly evaluate these processes in preparing our financial statements. The processes for revenue recognition, allowance for collection of trade receivables, allowance for excess or obsolete inventory and income taxes involve certain assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable under present facts and circumstances. These estimates and assumptions, if incorrect, could adversely impact our operations and financial position. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company began development of the BKR series LMR multi-band mobile radio product. The Company accounts for the costs of LMR multi-band development in accordance with ASC Topic 350-30, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. Upon the general release of the LMR multi-band mobile radio product currently in development to customers, development costs for that product will be amortized over periods not exceeding ten years, based on future revenue of the product. 
 
 There were no other changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 
 As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 229.10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to include the disclosure under this Item.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who serves as our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (who serves as our principal financial and accounting officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including each of such officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 As of the date of this filing, except as set forth herein, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024. The Risk Factors set forth in the 2023 Form 10-K should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and in connection with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the risks described in the 2023 Form 10-K could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or future results and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made. These are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. 
 
 Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On December 21, 2021, the Company announced that the Board authorized a share repurchase program which permits the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of 5 million of its common shares. The program does not have an expiration date. Any repurchases would be funded using cash on hand and cash from operations. The actual timing, manner, and number of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management and the Board at their discretion and will depend on several factors, including the market price of the Company s common shares, general market and economic conditions, alternative investment opportunities, and other business considerations in accordance with applicable securities laws and exchange rules. The authorization of the share repurchase program does not require BK Technologies to acquire any particular number of shares and repurchases may be suspended or terminated at any time at the Company s discretion. The following table provides information about purchases made by us of our common stock for each month included in the third quarter of 2024:
