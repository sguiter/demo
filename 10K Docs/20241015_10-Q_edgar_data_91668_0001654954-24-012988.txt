Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Company has not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements. 18 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements . These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects and potential strategic transactions. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described under the caption "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2024, including those identified below. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Some of the factors that may impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects include: Loss of, or reduction of business from, substantial clients could hurt our business by reducing our revenues, profitability and cash flow. Our complex manufacturing processes may lower yields and reduce our revenues. The acquisition of MEI may not yield the results or benefits desired or anticipated. Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain qualified supplies of raw materials, parts and finished components on a timely basis and at a cost-effective price. We are dependent on government contracts, which are subject to termination, price renegotiations and regulatory compliance, which can increase the cost of doing business and negatively impact our revenues. Changes in government policy or economic conditions or technology or reduction in government spending to which our business relates could negatively impact our results. Our inventories may become obsolete and other assets may be subject to risks. Environmental regulations could require us to incur significant costs. Our business is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce gross profit margins and the value of an investment in our Company. Changes in Defense related programs and priorities could reduce the revenues and profitability of our business. Our operating results may decrease due to the decline of profitability in the semiconductor industry. Uncertainty of current economic conditions, domestically and globally, including the risk of a recession in the U.S. or elsewhere, could adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our business. We may not achieve the intended effects of our business strategy, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our inability to introduce new products could result in decreased revenues and loss of market share to competitors; new technologies could also reduce the demand for our products. The nature of our products exposes us to potentially significant product liability risk. We depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business. Provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult to acquire our Company and may reduce the market price of our stock. Natural disasters, like hurricanes, or occurrences of other natural disasters whether in the United States or internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our profitability. Failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to use certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete. We cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment. We may make substantial investments in property, plant and equipment that may become impaired. While we attempt to monitor the credit worthiness of our customers, we may be at risk due to the adverse financial condition of one or more customers. Our international operations expose us to material risks, including risks under U.S. export laws. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise the integrity of our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. The price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and may fluctuate widely in the future. We cannot guarantee that we will declare future cash dividend payments, nor repurchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Compliance with regulations regarding the use of "conflict minerals" could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products. Our failure to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or our identification of any other material weaknesses in the future may adversely affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK This item is not applicable as we are currently considered a smaller reporting company. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e), and 15d-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of August 31, 2024 due to the material weakness described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2024 under Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. However, giving full consideration to the material weakness and the remediation plan, the Company s management has concluded that the Company s financial statements included in this Quarterly Report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 20 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. As of August 31, 2024, we had no known material current, pending, or threatened litigation. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part 1, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.
