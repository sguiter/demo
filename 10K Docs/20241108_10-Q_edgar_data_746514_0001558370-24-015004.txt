The properties are located in Eastern Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire. to ownership interest in each subsidiary except for the limited liability companies (the Investment Properties or Joint Ventures in which the Partnership has a - ownership interest. The consolidated group is referred to as the Partnership . Minority interests are not recorded, since they are insignificant. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Partnership accounts for its investment in the above-mentioned Investment Properties using the equity method of consolidation. (See Note 15: Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.) The Partnership accounts for its investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Generally, the Partnership would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances) is reduced to and would not provide for additional losses unless the Partnership has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee. If the venture subsequently generates income, the Partnership only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses. In 2013 and beyond, the carrying values of some investments fell below zero. We intend to fund our share of the investments future operating deficits should the need arise. However, we have legal obligation to pay for any of the liabilities of such investments nor do we have any legal obligation to fund operating deficits. (See Note 15: Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.) The authoritative guidance on consolidation provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities or VIEs and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIE (the primary beneficiary ). Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that equity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the

 in arrears are charged against income. The commercial tenants are evaluated on a case by case basis. Certain leases of the commercial properties provide for increasing stepped minimum rents, which are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Revenue from commercial leases also include reimbursements and recoveries received from tenants for certain costs as provided in the lease agreement. The costs generally include real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance and recoverable costs. Rental concessions are also accounted for on the straight-line basis. Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the differences between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases . The capitalized above-market lease amounts are accounted for as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options of the respective leases. The Partnership evaluates the non-lease components (lease arrangements that include common area maintenance services) with related lease components (lease revenues). If both the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease component and related lease component, the lease component is the predominant component. The Partnership elected an allowed practical expedient. For (i) operating lease arrangements involving real estate that include common area maintenance services and (ii) all real estate arrangements that include real estate taxes and insurance costs, we present these amounts within lease revenues in our consolidated statements of income. We record amounts reimbursed by the lessee in the period in which the applicable expenses are incurred.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward Looking Statements Certain information contained herein includes forward looking statements, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Liquidation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act ). Forward looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in written form from time to time, reflect management s good faith belief when those statements are made, and are based on information currently available to management. Caution should be exercised in interpreting and relying on such forward looking statements, the realization of which may be impacted by known and unknown risks and uncertainties, events that may occur subsequent to the forward looking statements, and other factors which may be beyond the Partnership s control and which can materially affect the Partnership s actual results, performance or achievements for 2024 and beyond. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties mentioned below materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. For an additional discussion of factors that may affect the Partnership s business and results of operations, see Item1A-Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,2023. Over a period of time both in 2021 and 2022, the Partnership took advantage of the low interest rate environment and refinanced fifteen properties, increased their loan balances, and raised approximately 130,000,000. With interest rates rising, and a threat of an economic slowdown, the Partnership increased the debt level and built cash reserves to acquire additional properties when opportunities become available. Currently, 86,134,000 of these reserves are invested in short-term US Treasury bills maturing in 6 months or less with interest rates between 4.48 and 5.27 . Since the Partnership s long-term goals include the acquisition of additional properties, a portion of the proceeds from the refinancing and sale of properties is reserved for this purpose. If available acquisitions do not meet the Partnership s investment criteria, the Partnership may purchase additional depositary receipts. The Partnership will consider refinancing existing properties if the Partnership s cash reserves are insufficient to repay existing mortgages or if the Partnership needs additional funds for future acquisitions. On July 14, 2023, the Partnership purchased a mixed use property in the South End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts comprised of three buildings at 26-30 Rutland Street, 105-117 West Concord Street and 475 Shawmut Avenue, and approximately 3,400 square feet of commercial space for a purchase price of 27,500,000 with Partnership cash reserves. The vacancy rate for the Partnership s residential properties as of November 1, 2024 was 1.7 as compared with a vacancy rate of 0.9 as of November 1, 2023. The vacancy rate for the Joint Venture properties as of November 1, 2024 was 2.8 , as compared to 0.7 for the same period last year. Residential tenants generally have lease terms of 12 months. The majority of these leases will mature during the second and third quarters of the year. During the third quarter of 2024, rents increased an average of 5.4 for renewals and increased an average of 4.6 for new leases. For the balance of 2024, management expects a rental market with continued but moderating rent growth. For the third quarter of 2024, consolidated revenue increased by 6.6 , operating expenses decreased by 2.3 , and Income before Other Income (Expense) increased by 32.1 , as compared to the third quarter of 2023. On July 31, 2014, the Partnership entered into an agreement for a 25,000,000 revolving line of credit. The term of the line was for three years with a floating interest rate equal to a base rate of the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent per annum, or (c) the LIBOR Rate for a period of one month plus 1 per annum, plus the applicable margin of 2.5 . The agreement originally expired on July 31, 2017, and was extended until October 31, 2020. The costs associated with the line of credit extension were approximately 128,000. Prior to the 

 27 

Table of Contents 
 line s expiration in 2020, the Partnership exercised its option for a one-year extension until October 31, 2021. The Partnership paid an extension fee of approximately 37,500 in association with the extension. On October 29, 2021, t he Partnership closed on the modification of its existing line of credit. The agreement extends the credit line for three years until October 29, 2024. The commitment amount is for 25 million but is restricted to 17 million during the modification period. The modification period phased out as of December 31, 2022. During this period, the loan covenants were modified from a minimum consolidated debt service ratio of 1.60 to a ratio of 1.35 until September 30, 2022; from a minimum tangible net worth requirement of 200 million to a net worth of 175 million until September 30, 2022; from a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 65 to a ratio of 70 until September 30, 2022 and from a minimum debt yield of 9.5 to a yield of 8.5 until September 30, 2022 and a yield of 9.0 until December 31, 2022. Once the financial performance of the Partnership meets the original covenant tests for the trailing 12-month period, the commitment amount will return to 25 million. As of September 30, 2024, the portfolio s debt yield achieved the minimum of 9.5 , and the Partnership complied with all financial covenants. The line of credit expired on October 29,2024.The Partnership is currently in discussions with a lender for a replacement line of credit.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Partnership purchased a total of 17,590 Depositary Receipts. On February 24, 2019, Harold Brown, the owner of 75 of the outstanding voting securities of NewReal, Inc.

Moreover, 75 of the issued and outstanding Class B units of the Partnership are owned by HBC Holdings LLC, an entity of which Jameson Brown is the manager. The outstanding stock of The Hamilton Company, Inc. is controlled by Jameson Brown and Harley Brown. In addition to the Management Fee, the Partnership Agreement further provides for the employment of outside professionals to provide services to the Partnership and allows NewReal to charge the Partnership for the cost of employing professionals to assist with the administration of the Partnership s properties. Additionally, from time to time, the Partnership pays Hamilton for repairs and maintenance services, legal services, construction services and accounting services. The costs charged by Hamilton for these services are at the same hourly rate charged to all entities managed by Hamilton, and management believes such rates are competitive in the marketplace.

For more information on related party transactions, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires the Partnership to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Partnership regularly and continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties and its investments in and advances to joint ventures. The Partnership bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. The Partnership s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about such matters that are highly uncertain. Different estimates could have a material effect on the Partnership s financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Principles of Consolidation. Revenue Recognition: Rental income from residential and commercial properties is recognized over the term of the related lease. For residential tenants, amounts 60 days in arrears are charged against income. The commercial tenants are evaluated on a case by case basis. Certain leases of the commercial properties provide for increasing stepped minimum rents, which are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Revenue from commercial leases also include reimbursements and recoveries received from tenants for certain costs as provided in the lease agreement. The costs generally include real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance and recoverable costs. Rental concessions are also accounted for on the straight-line basis. Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the differences between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases . The capitalized above-market lease amounts are accounted for as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options of the respective leases. The Partnership evaluates the non-lease components (lease arrangements that include common area maintenance services) with related lease components (lease revenues). If both the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease component and related lease component, the lease component is the predominant component. The 

 29 

Table of Contents 
 Partnership elected an allowed practical expedient. For (i) operating lease arrangements involving real estate that include common area maintenance services and (ii) all real estate arrangements that include real estate taxes and insurance costs, we present these amounts within lease revenues in our consolidated statements of income. We record amounts reimbursed by the lessee in the period in which the applicable expenses are incurred. Rental Property Held f or Sale: When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Partnership discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs, of such assets. The Partnership generally considers assets to be held for sale when the transaction has received appropriate corporate authority, and there are no significant contingencies relating to the sale. If, in management s opinion, the estimated net sales price, net of selling costs, of the assets which have been identified as held for sale is less than the carrying value of the assets, a valuation allowance is established. If circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and, as a result, the Partnership decides not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale, the property is reclassified as held and used. A property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of (a) its carrying value before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation (amortization) expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used, or (b) the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell. Rental Properties: Rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; improvements and additions are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the asset and related accumulated depreciation is eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss on such disposition is included in income. Fully depreciated assets are removed from the accounts. Rental properties are depreciated by both straight-line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives. Upon acquisition of rental property, the Partnership estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed, generally consisting of the fair value of (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place leases and (iii) tenant relationships. The Partnership allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The Partnership records goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase (if any) if the net assets acquired/liabilities assumed exceed the purchase consideration of a transaction. In estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, the Partnership considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities, and utilizes various valuation methods, such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. Costs directly related to the acquisition, development and construction of rental properties are capitalized. Capitalized development and construction costs include pre-construction costs, development and construction costs, regulatory fees, interest, property taxes, insurance, construction oversight fees, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. The Partnership considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the substantial completion of improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. Intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values above and below market leases and tenant relationship values, which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the Partnership s overall relationship with the respective tenant. Factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in-place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, management considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the Partnership s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases. The value of tenant relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property may be impaired, an analysis of the value is prepared. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are compared to the asset s carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value is required. Impairment: On an annual basis management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Partnership s rental properties may be impaired. A property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the

Table of Contents 
 aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property. The Partnership s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and costs to operate each property. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions, the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be achieved. Investments in Treasury Bills: Investments in Treasury Bills are recorded at amortized cost and classified as held to maturity as the Partnership has the intent and the ability to hold them until they mature. The carrying value of the Treasury Bills are adjusted for accretion of discounts over the remaining life of the investment. Income related to the Treasury Bills is recognized in interest income in the Partnership s consolidated statement of income. Investments in Joint Ventures: The Partnership accounts for its 40 -50 ownership in the Investment Properties under the equity method of accounting, as it exercises significant influence over, but does not control these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for the Partnership s share in earnings, cash contributions and distributions. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the Partnership is included on the consolidated statements of income. Generally, the Partnership would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances) is reduced to zero and would not provide for additional losses unless the Partnership has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee. If the venture subsequently generates income, the Partnership only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses. We intend to fund our share of the investments future operating deficits should the need arise. However, we have no legal obligation to pay for any of the liabilities of such investments nor do we have any legal obligation to fund operating deficits. The authoritative guidance on consolidation provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities or VIEs and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIE (the primary beneficiary ). Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that equity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entity s performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and rights to receive the returns from VIE that would be significant to the VIE. With respect to investments in and advances to the Investment Properties, the Partnership looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties. An impairment charge is recorded if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. Legal Proceedings: The Partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business. These matters are frequently covered by insurance. If it is determined that a loss is likely to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements. Both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered likely can be difficult to determine.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Partnership s principal source of cash during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was the collection of rents. The Partnership s principal use of cash during the first nine months of 2024 was the construction of the Mill Street Development, improvements to rental properties, mortgage principal payments, purchases of U.S. Treasury bills, and distributions to partners. The Partnership s principal use of cash during the first nine months of 2023 was the purchase of Treasury Bills and the purchase of two properties: the commercial property at 653 Worcester Road for approximately 10,000,000, and the purchase of a mixed use property in the South End neighborhood of Boston, MA, for a purchase price of approximately 27,500,000. The majority of cash and cash equivalents of 15,069,693 at September 30, 2024 and 18,230,463 at December 31, 2023 were held in interest bearing accounts at creditworthy financial institutions. The decrease in cash of 3,160,770 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is summarized as follows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash provided by operating activities 19,965,878 13,231,030 Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (9,570,177) 4,068,468 Purchase of rental property (37,518,172) Principal payments of mortgage notes payable (2,098,252) (1,997,909) Repurchase of Depositary Receipts, Class B and General Partner Units (1,613,829) (2,657,477) Distributions paid (9,844,390) (8,545,265) Net (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (3,160,770) (33,419,325) The net increase in cash provided by operating activities is due to various factors, including a change in depreciation expense, a change in income and distribution from joint ventures, and other factors. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily for the improvement of rental properties, including the Mill Street Development project. Financing activities include mortgage principal payments and distributions to partners, and repurchase of depositary receipts. During 2024, the Partnership and its Subsidiary Partnerships have completed improvements to certain of the Properties at a total cost of approximately 15,369,000. These improvements were funded from cash reserves. Cash reserves have been adequate to fully fund improvements. Cash reserves used for the Mill Street Development Project were approximately 7,962,000. Beyond the Mill Street Development Project, the most significant improvements were made at Executive Apartments, 1144 Commonwealth, River Drive Apartments, Redwood Hills, Hamilton Oaks, and Westgate Woburn at a cost of approximately 1,339,000, 960,000, 871,000, 844,000, 656,000 and 322,000 respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Partnership received distributions of approximately 3,972,500, from the investment properties. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Partnership received 3,033,500 in distributions from the investment properties. Included in these net distributions is the amount from both Hamilton on Main of approximately 2,000,000 and 430,000 and Dexter Park of approximately 1,340,000 and 1,492,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 In March 2024, the Partnership approved a quarterly distribution of 12.00 per Unit 0.40 per Receipt), payable on March 28, 2024. In addition to the quarterly distribution, there was a special distribution of 48.00 per Class A unit 1.60 per Receipt) payable on March 28, 2024. In May 2024, the Partnership approved a quarterly distribution of 12.00 per Unit 0.40 per Receipt), payable on June 28, 2024. In August 2024, the Partnership approved a quarterly distribution of 12.00 per Unit 0.40 per Receipt), payable on September 28, 2024. The Partnership anticipates that cash from operations will be sufficient to fund its current operations, pay distributions, and make required debt payments. The Partnership anticipates that the Mill Street Development project will require approximately 30 million in spending over the next two years, with approximately 10 million to be spent in 2024 and approximately 20 million to be spent in 2025. Construction is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2025 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Venture Indebtedness As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership had a 40 -50 ownership interest in seven Joint Ventures, five of which have mortgage indebtedness. We do not have control of these partnerships and therefore we account for them using the equity method of consolidation. At September 30, 2024, our proportionate share of the non-recourse debt related to these investments was approximately 73,946,000. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations As of September 30, 2024, we are subject to debt obligations as described in the table below.

The project includes 72 residential units comprising approximately 93,000 square feet, and is estimated to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2025. Total investment to date is approximately 8.4 million, and the total investment upon completion is anticipated to be approximately 30 million . The partnership is using cash reserves to fund this construction, but will finance a portion of construction costs upon completion of the project. In connection with the Mill Street development project, the Partnership has entered into a contract with a general contractor with a current contract value of approximately 30 million . We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year. These contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. See Notes 5 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of mortgage notes payable. The Partnerships has no other material contractual obligations to be disclosed.

 Factors That May Affect Future Results Along with risks detailed in Item 1A of the Partnership s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2024 and from time to time in the Partnership s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, some factors that could cause the Partnership s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include but are not limited to the following: The Partnership depends on the real estate markets where its properties are located, primarily in Eastern Massachusetts, and these markets may be adversely affected by local economic market conditions, which are beyond the Partnership s control. The Partnership is subject to the general economic risks affecting the real estate industry, such as dependence on tenants financial condition, the need to enter into new leases or renew leases on terms favorable to tenants in order to generate rental revenues and our ability to collect rents from our tenants. The Partnership is also impacted by changing economic conditions making alternative housing arrangements more or less attractive to the Partnership s tenants, such as the interest rates on single family home mortgages and the availability and purchase price of single family homes in the Greater Boston metropolitan area. The Partnership is subject to significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property. Our actual costs to develop properties may exceed our budgeted costs. The Partnership is subject to increases in heating and utility costs that may arise as a result of economic and market conditions and fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions. Civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters may result in uninsured or underinsured losses. Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties. Financing or refinancing of Partnership properties may not be available to the extent necessary or desirable, or may not be available on favorable terms. The Partnership properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. This competition may affect the Partnership s ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents that can be charged. Given the nature of the real estate business, the Partnership is subject to potential environmental liabilities. These include environmental contamination in the soil at the Partnership s or neighboring real estate, whether caused by the Partnership, previous owners of the subject property or neighbors of the subject property, and the presence of hazardous materials in the Partnership s buildings, such as asbestos, lead, mold and radon gas. Management is not aware of any material environmental liabilities at this time. Insurance coverage for and relating to commercial properties is increasingly costly and difficult to obtain. In addition, insurance carriers have excluded certain specific items from standard insurance policies, which have resulted in increased risk exposure for the Partnership. These include insurance coverage for acts of terrorism and war, and coverage for mold and other environmental conditions. Coverage for these items is either unavailable or prohibitively expensive. Market interest rates could adversely affect market prices for Class A Partnership Units and Depositary Receipts as well as performance and cash flow.

 Changes in income tax laws and regulations may affect the income taxable to owners of the Partnership. These changes may affect the after-tax value of future distributions. The Partnership may fail to identify, acquire, construct or develop additional properties; may develop or acquire properties that do not produce a desired or expected yield on invested capital; may be unable to sell poorly-performing or otherwise undesirable properties quickly; or may fail to effectively integrate acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties. Risk associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments. Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties. Any weakness identified in the Partnership s internal controls as part of the evaluation being undertaken could have an adverse effect on the Partnership s business. Ongoing compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may require additional personnel or systems changes. 
 The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive or as an admission regarding the adequacy of disclosures made by the Partnership prior to the date hereof or the effectiveness of said Act. The Partnership expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices. In pursuing its business plan, the primary market risk to which the Partnership is exposed is interest rate risk. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between the Partnership s yield on invested assets and cost of funds and, in turn, its ability to make distributions or payments to its investors. As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership, its Subsidiary Partnerships and the Investment Properties collectively have approximately 582,234,000 in long-term debt, substantially all of which require payment of interest at fixed rates. Accordingly, the fair value of these debt instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. This long term debt matures through 2035. The Partnership, its Subsidiary Partnerships and the Investment Properties collectively have variable rate debt of 10,000,000 (without taking out unamortized deferred financing costs) as of September 30, 2024. Interest rates ranged from SOFR plus 170 basis points to SOFR plus 310 basis points. Assuming interest-rate caps are not in effect, if market rates of interest on the Partnership s variable rate debt increased or decreased by 100 basis points, then the increase or decrease in interest costs on the Partnership s variable rate debt would be approximately 50,000 annually and the increase or decrease in the fair value of the Partnership s fixed rate debt as of September 30, 2024 would be approximately 21,970,000. For information regarding the fair value and maturity dates of these debt obligations, See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Mortgage Notes Payable, Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Fair Value Measurements and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures .
