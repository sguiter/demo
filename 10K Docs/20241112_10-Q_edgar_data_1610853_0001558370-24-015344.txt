Warrants The Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of Common Stock 2022 Warrants in connection with the August 2022 Public Offering, as more fully described in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included our 2023 10-K. The 2022 Warrants did not meet the guidance for being classified as an equity instrument due to a potential price reset prompted by a change in an unrelated instrument s conversion rate or, in the event of a fundamental transaction, settlement rights that differ from those of the underlying common stockholders. Accordingly, the 2022 Warrants are being accounted for as a derivative liability instrument. As a result of the Company s Reverse Stock Split on August 16, 2023, refer to Note 1, the exercise price on the 2022 Warrants was reset to per share based on the volume-weighted average price VWAP for the five stock trading days immediately following the Reverse Stock Split. On May 9, 2024, in connection with the 2024 Public Offering, the exercise price of the 2022 Warrants was again reset to per share based on the VWAP for the five stock trading days immediately following the announcement of the 2024 Public Offering. The fair value of the 2022 Warrants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was determined using both a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of the occurrence of a price reset or a fundamental transaction and the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table includes the share price and the inputs used to estimate the fair value of the warrants: Warrant term (in years) Expected volatility Risk-free interest rate Dividend rate The fair value of the derivative liability associated with the 2022 Warrants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. The change in the fair value of the derivative liability was recognized as a component of nonoperating income (expense) in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 2022 Warrants were exercised to purchase of shares of Common Stock at per share for thousand in net proceeds and 2022 Warrants were cancelled during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Company Overview We are a neurotechnology company focused on neurological wellness. Our purpose is to develop, license or acquire non-implantable technologies targeted at reducing symptoms of neurological disease or trauma. Our product, known as the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator, or PoNS , is an innovative non-implantable medical device, inclusive of a controller and mouthpiece, which delivers mild electrical stimulation to the surface of the tongue to provide treatment of gait deficit and chronic balance deficit. PoNS Therapy is integral to the overall PoNS solution and is the physical therapy applied by patients during use of the PoNS device. PoNS has marketing clearance in the U.S. for use as a short-term treatment of gait deficit due to mild-to-moderate symptoms for multiple sclerosis MS and is to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program in patients 22 years of age and over by prescription only. We began accepting prescriptions for PoNS in the U.S. in March 2022, and commercial sales of PoNS commenced in April 2022. PoNS is authorized for sale in Canada for three indications: (i) as a short term treatment (14 weeks) of chronic balance deficit due to mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury and is to be used in conjunction with physical therapy; (ii) as a short term treatment (14 weeks) of gait deficit due to mild and moderate symptoms from MS and it is to be used in conjunction with physical therapy; and (iii) as a short term treatment (14 weeks) of gait deficit due to mild and moderate symptoms from stroke, to be used in conjunction with physical therapy. It has been commercially available in Canada since March 2019. PoNS is authorized for sale as a Class IIa medical device in Australia and we have been seeking a business partner to commercialize and distribute PoNS in Australia. Recent Developments Corporate Updates Presently, PoNS Therapy is not covered by CMS or reimbursed under contract by any third-party payers in the U.S. We are pursuing commercial insurance coverage and Medicare reimbursement for PoNS within the Durable Medical Equipment benefit category. On February 29, 2024, CMS assigned HCPCS Level II codes to the PoNS controller and PoNS mouthpiece, effective April 1, 2024. On May 2, 2024, CMS published a proposed fee schedule payment rates for the PoNS controller and PoNS mouthpiece to be discussed at CMS' bi-annual Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System HCPCS public meeting to be held on May 29, 2024. For the PoNS Controller (HCPCS Code A4593), CMS preliminarily set pricing by mapping reimbursement to existing code E0745, (Neuromuscular stimulator, electronic shock unit), resulting in a capped fee of 1,206.53. For the PoNS Mouthpiece (HCPCS code A4594), CMS based pricing on the previously offered, temporary, cash pay price of 4,500, resulting in a total capped payment of 3,075.53. The Company subsequently provided CMS additional information to support reimbursement economics and presented that information at the public meeting with CMS on May 29, 2024 for consideration by CMS for determination of the final reimbursement amount for each of the PoNS controller and mouthpiece. On October 7, 2024, CMS posted the final payment rate for the PoNS Mouthpiece (HCPCS code A4594) at 2,963.30, which will be effective January 1, 2025 and deferred final national determination of the payment rate for the PoNS Controller (HCPCS Code A4593) to the next payment cycle. The Company has requested to meet with CMS prior to PoNS Mouthpiece pricing taking effect on January 1, 2025 to request that they revisit the starting point for the gap filling process to more appropriately use the market pricing established through negotiation with the VA and an insurance carrier. On October 8, 2024, CMS published the preliminary rate for the PoNS Controller (HCPCS Code A4593) at the capped total payment of 519.80, based on its view that the product is comparable to devices reported with HCPCS code E0730 (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device, four or more leads, for multiple nerve stimulation) to be effective April 1, 2025. The Company is scheduled to discuss the preliminary decision regarding the PoNS Controller at the HCPCS public meeting on November 8, 2024 where it plans to present the differences between the PoNS Controller from TENS devices. The Company will request that CMS set pricing for the PoNS Controller using the gap filling methodology that works off the government contract and insurance. On August 9, 2024, we received written notice (the Notification Letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying us that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing 

 18 

Table of Contents 
 Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum closing bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company s Class A common stock Common Stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the Notification Letter, the Company did not meet the minimum closing bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company s Common Stock must be at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time prior to February 5, 2025. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and other Nasdaq listing criteria. If we fail to meet the applicable continued listing requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market, Nasdaq may delist our Common Stock. If such delisting should occur, it would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair an investor s ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when desired. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our Common Stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our Common Stock, prevent our Common Stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements. Additionally, Nasdaq rules allow an expedited delisting of securities of companies that have had one or more reverse stock splits with a cumulative ratio of one for 250 or more shares over the prior two-year period. Under these rules, if a company falls out of compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price after completing reverse stock splits over the immediately preceding two years that cumulatively result in a ratio one for 250 shares, the company will not be able to avail itself of any compliance periods and Nasdaq will instead require the issuance of a Staff delisting determination, which is appealable to a hearings panel. Our ability to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market may be negatively impacted by this Nasdaq rule. As discussed further in Note 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, in May 2024, the Company closed on a registered public offering of its Common Stock and warrants and received net proceeds of approximately 5.5 million. On April 4, 2024, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq stating that the Company no longer complied with the minimum stockholders equity requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC because the Company s stockholders' equity, as reported in our 2023 10-K, had fallen below 2.5 million. The notice also indicated that the Company did not meet the alternative compliance standards. Under applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company had 45 calendar days from the date of the notice, or until May 20, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance. On May 31, 2024, the Company received formal notification from Nasdaq confirming that, following the consummation of a registered public offering on May 9, 2024, the Company regained compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement, and that the Company satisfied all other applicable criteria for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company received the first third-party reimbursement from a major insurance carrier at a 7 rebate, which results in pricing of 23,900 for the PoNS device, comprised of 16,554 for the PoNS controller and 7,347 for the PoNS mouthpiece, exclusive of rounding. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company partnered with Lovell Government Services, an SBA-certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, to make the PoNS device available to federal healthcare systems. In May 2024, PoNS became available on the Veteran Affairs Federal Supply Schedule and General Services Administration Advantage Contracts at 23,843.72 for the PoNS device and 7,344.97 for the PoNS mouthpiece. In July 2024, PoNS became available to the Department of Defense and U.S. Military facilities on the Distribution and Pricing Agreement at 23,724.50 for the PoNS device and 7,308.25 for the PoNS mouthpiece. In June 2024, the Company began establishing sales representative agreements with organizations and individuals to sell PoNS devices to Veterans Affairs VA facilities in the U.S. The Company has since established agreements with representatives covering facilities in Texas and east of the Mississippi with plans to expand west. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company reached alignment with the FDA on a registrational program to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of PoNS on gait and balance deficits in chronic stroke subjects that consists of a randomized controlled study and an open label study, targeting to enroll 60 and 30 subjects respectively, supported by additional data from an 

 19 

Table of Contents 
 investigator initiated clinical IIT trial in collaboration with Medical University of South Carolina MUSC ), aiming to enroll 60 subjects at two U.S. sites, including MUSC and Brooks Rehabilitation in Jacksonville, FL. To sustain the US registration for stroke, Helius has started, in the summer of 2024, the company-sponsored pivotal randomized controlled study HMI-RCT on the efficacy and safety of PoNS Therapy in people with chronic stroke at five to six Canadian and US centers of excellence for stroke rehabilitation. Sites have started enrollment in July are expected to complete target enrollment by the end of 2024. The company-sponsored open label study HMI-OLS ), which started early in 2024 and is currently ongoing at five U.S. sites, has completed the target enrollment of 30 participants on Sep 30, 2024. The results from the HMI- RCT and HMI-OLS will constitute the primary data package submission, which will be also supported by the results from the IIT, to obtain FDA authorization for stroke in the United States. Enrollment for the registrational program is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 with a submission to FDA targeted for mid-to-late 2025. An outcome research program to assess the effect of on-label PoNS Therapy on the risk of falling in subjects with gait and balance deficit due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis is ongoing at three sites in Canada with results expected by the end of 2024. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company began implementing the transition of the manufacturing of PoNS device controllers and mouthpieces to Minnetronix, Inc. from its previous contract manufacturer, Key Tronic Corporation. The Company expects the transition to be substantially completed by the end of 2024. We will continue to monitor the development of CMS s new pathway for coverage of innovative new devices, Transitional Coverage of Emerging Technology TCET ), which is replacing the repealed Medicare Coverage of Innovative Technologies rule. CMS is expected to provide additional information about TCET to the public for comments in 2024. As we follow the evolution of TCET, we will continue to assess our evidence generation strategy to reach the greatest potential to gain CMS reimbursement benefits as a result of our breakthrough designation in MS. We also intend to provide broad access and reimbursement for the PoNS Therapy over time through commercial insurers. Prior to the initiation of CMS or broad commercial payer coverage, we anticipate the primary source of sales will be self-pay and VA patients. We expect to support the cost of the PoNS Therapy by working with advocacy groups and charitable organizations to help self-pay patients access our technology. In general, we anticipate that it will take at least 24 months to obtain broad coverage and reimbursement among government and private payers from the date that the HCPCS codes became effective. Material Trends and Uncertainties Global Economic Conditions Generally, worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain, in part due to supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, global conflicts and increased inflation. The general economic and capital market conditions both in the U.S. and worldwide, have been volatile in recent years and at times have adversely affected our access to capital and have increased the cost of capital. The capital and credit markets may not be available to support future capital raising activity on favorable terms. If economic conditions continue to remain volatile or decline, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected. Our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in the overall macroeconomic environment and other economic factors. Changes in economic conditions, supply chain constraints, logistics challenges, labor shortages, global conflicts such as the conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East, and steps taken by governments and central banks as well as other stimulus and spending programs, have led to higher inflation, which has led to an increase in costs and has caused changes in fiscal and monetary policy, including increased interest rates. Although we may take measures to mitigate these impacts, if these measures are not effective, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.

 Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Revenue: Product sales, net: United States 7 60 (53) Canada 33 72 (39) Total product sales, net 40 132 (92) Other revenue 11 11 Total revenue 51 143 (92) Cost of revenue 187 187 Gross loss (136) (44) (92) Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,850 2,196 654 Research and development expenses 1,077 722 355 Amortization expense 7 32 (25) Fixed asset impairment 159 (159) Total operating expenses 3,934 3,109 825 Loss from operations (4,070) (3,153) (917) Nonoperating income (expense) Interest income (expense), net (1) 68 (69) Change in fair value of derivative liability 152 (393) 545 Foreign exchange gain (loss) 178 (192) 370 Other income, net 55 7 48 Nonoperating income (expense), net 384 (510) 894 Loss before provision for income taxes (3,686) (3,663) (23) Provision for income taxes Net loss (3,686) (3,663) (23) Revenue The decrease in net product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily attributable to a decrease in U.S. sales of PoNS systems after the termination of our Patient Therapy Access Program PTAP on June 30, 2023 as well as the termination of the previously offered temporary cash pay pricing in May 2024.

 Cost of Revenue The cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects adjustments to excess inventory reserves resulting from advanced purchases relating to our third-party contract manufacturer transition and in part from adjustments to the production forecast based upon the continued delay by CMS in establish reimbursement pricing for the PoNS Mouthpiece and Controller. Gross Loss Gross loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 136 thousand compared to 44 thousand for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily a result of lower sales compared to the same period in the prior year and the impact of the inventory adjustment in cost of revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expense The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in prior year resulted primarily from a 0.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in costs relating to the transfer of third-party manufacturing as well as a 0.2 million in asset impairment expense in the prior year period. Research and Development Expense The increase in research and development expenses was driven primarily by an increase in clinical trial activities for stroke and risk of fall programs. Amortization Expense Amortization expense was primarily comprised of the amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets. The change in amortization expense period over period is primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. Fixed Asset Impairment During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an impairment of 159 thousand for certain machinery used in the production of our inventory. Nonoperating income (expense) Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net interest income in the prior year period resulted from lower cash balances earning interest income year to year, respectively, offset by interest expense related to lease commitments. Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability As discussed in more detail in Note 6 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the warrants issued in connection with the public offering completed on August 9, 2022 are being accounted for as a derivative liability instrument. The gain on change in fair value of derivative liability for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.2 million was primarily due to a decrease in our stock price.

 Foreign Exchange Loss The change in foreign exchange (loss) gain was primarily due to fluctuations in the Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rates. Other Income, Net Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to dividend income earned on investments of excess cash in money market mutual funds. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

 Cost of Revenue The cost of revenue decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower sales and inventory adjustments compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross Profit (loss) Gross loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 60 thousand compared to gross profit of 17 thousand for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily a result of lower sales compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by lower inventory adjustment. Selling, General and Administrative Expense The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in prior year was primarily attributable to a 0.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an absence of 0.2 million in asset impairment and a 0.3 million decrease in professional fees. Research and Development Expense The increase in research and development expenses year-to-year was primarily comprised of clinical trial activities for stroke and risk of fall programs. Amortization Expense Amortization expense was primarily comprised of the amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets. The change in amortization expense period over period is primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. Fixed Asset Impairment During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an impairment of 159 thousand for certain machinery used in the production of our inventory.

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability As discussed in more detail in Note 6 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the warrants issued in connection with the public offering completed on August 9, 2022 are being accounted for as a derivative liability instrument. The gain on change in fair value of derivative liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 3.0 million was primarily due to a decrease in our stock price.

 Foreign Exchange Loss The change in foreign exchange gain (loss) was primarily due to fluctuations in the Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rates. Other Income, Net Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to dividend income earned on investments of excess cash in money market mutual funds. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and working capital as of the end of the periods indicated in the table below (in thousands): 

September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 3,468 5,182 Working capital 3,910 5,559 Our available capital resources have been primarily used to expand our U.S. commercialization efforts, fund manufacturing activities for the PoNS device, conduct clinical trials and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents have been proceeds from public and private offerings of our Common Stock, which included 16.3 million in net proceeds we received from a public offering of our Common Stock and warrants completed in August 2022 as discussed in more detail in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included our 2023 10-K. As discussed in more detail in Note 6 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company entered into a sales agreement related to our at-the-market offering program ATM under which we may offer and sell shares having gross proceeds up to 2.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company issued and sold shares with gross proceeds of 1.4 million under the ATM. As discussed in more detail in Note 6, the Company received gross proceeds of 0.2 million from the issuance of shares upon the exercise of warrants and a 5.5 million net proceeds from the 2024 Public Offering in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Statement of Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash used in operating activities (8,663) (8,382) (281) Net cash used in investing activities (5) (26) 21 Net cash provided by financing activities 6,954 455 6,499 Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (1,714) (7,953) 6,239 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities The higher level of cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared with the same period in the prior year. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Our investing activities are primarily related to the purchases of property and equipment.

Table of Contents 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds of 5.5 million from the issuance of Common Stock and warrants under the 2024 Public Offering, and 1.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance and sale of shares under the ATM. In addition, we received 0.2 million in net proceeds from the exercise of warrants. Cash Requirements Our ability to generate product revenues sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful commercialization of PoNS Therapy in the U.S. Our net loss was 7.8 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 167.8 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. These and other factors indicate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Refer to Note 1 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion about our going concern uncertainty. We intend to use our available capital resources primarily to expand our U.S. commercialization efforts, fund manufacturing activities for the PoNS device, conduct clinical trials and for working capital and general corporate purposes. We believe that our existing capital resources, as well as the 5.5 million net proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock and warrants in May 2024 will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2025, but we will be required to seek additional funding through the sale of equity or debt financing to continue to fund our operations thereafter. We will need additional funding for our planned clinical trial for stroke. The amount required to fund operations thereafter will depend on various factors, including timing of approval of clinical trials, duration and result of clinical trials and other factors that affect the cost of the clinical trial, manufacturing costs of product, development of our product for new indications and demand for our authorized products in the market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital or that such capital, if available, will be on terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital, we may be compelled to reduce the scope of our operations and planned capital expenditure or sell certain assets, including intellectual property, and we may be forced to cease or wind down operations, seek protection under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or liquidate and dissolve our company. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates of our 2023 10-K. There have been no changes in critical accounting policies in the current year from those described in our 2023 10-K. ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Not applicable. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures 

 26 

Table of Contents 
 were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our management has concluded that the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our risk factors have not changed materially from those risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 10-K except as set forth below. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 10-K. The risks described in our 2023 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Nasdaq may delist our Common Stock from its exchange which could limit your ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. On August 9, 2024, we received a Notification Letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of Nasdaq notifying us that because the closing bid price of our Common Stock was below 1.00 per share for the prior 30 consecutive business days, we are not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). In accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a period of 180 calendar days from August 9, 2024, or until February 5, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If at any time before February 5, 2025, the closing bid price of our Common Stock closes at or above 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days (which number days may be extended by Nasdaq), Nasdaq will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and the matter would be resolved. The Notification Letter also disclosed that in the event we do not regain compliance with the Rule by February 5, 2025, we may be eligible for additional time. To qualify for additional time, we would be required to meet the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable standards for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and would need to provide written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. If we meet these requirements, Nasdaq will inform us that it has been granted an additional 180 calendar days. However, if it appears to the Staff that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are otherwise not eligible, Nasdaq will provide notice that our securities will be subject to delisting. We intend to continue actively monitor the closing bid price for our Common Stock between now and February 5, 2025, and will consider available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If we do not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period, including any extensions that may be

Table of Contents 
 granted by Nasdaq, Nasdaq will provide notice that our Common Stock will be subject to delisting. We would then be entitled to appeal that determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. There can be no assurance that we will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement during the 180-day compliance period, secure a second period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance, or maintain compliance with the other Nasdaq listing requirements. If our Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq, our ability to raise capital through public offerings of our securities and to finance our operations could be adversely affected. We also believe that delisting would likely result in decreased liquidity and/or increased volatility in our Common Stock and could harm our business and future prospects. In addition, we believe that, if our Common Stock is delisted, our stockholders would likely find it more difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of the Common Stock and it may be more difficult for stockholders to buy or sell our Common Stock at competitive market prices, or at all. If CMS does not change its position on the reimbursement rates of the PoNS Controller and Mouthpiece, the use of our products may decline and our ability to generate revenue may be decreased. In the U.S., the commercial success of our existing and any future products largely depends on the extent to which governmental payers at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our products. The existence of coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products by government and private payers is critical to market acceptance of our existing and future products. Suppliers are not likely to furnish our existing and any future products if they do not receive adequate reimbursement for our products. Many private payers currently base their reimbursement policies on the coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by CMS, which administers the Medicare program. On October 7, 2024, CMS posted the final payment rate for the PoNS Mouthpiece at 2,963.30 to be effective January 1, 2025 and deferred final national determination of the payment rate for the PoNS Controller to the next payment cycle. On October 8, 2024, CMS published the preliminary rate for the PoNS Controller at the capped total payment of 519.80 to be effective April 1, 2025. We have requested to meet with CMS prior to the PoNS Mouthpiece pricing taking effect on January 1, 2025 to request that CMS considers increasing this rate by revisiting the starting point for the gap filling process to more appropriately use the market pricing established through our prior negotiation with the VA and an insurance carrier. In addition, we are scheduled to discuss the preliminary decision regarding the PoNS Controller at the HCPCS public meeting on November 8, 2024. At this meeting, we plan to request that CMS consider increasing the PoNS Controller reimbursement rate by presenting the differences between the PoNS Controller from TENS devices as CMS has based the current preliminary rate on its view that the PoNS Controller is comparable to devices reported with HCPCS code E0730 (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device, four or more leads, for multiple nerve stimulation). At this meeting, we will also request that CMS set pricing for the PoNS Controller using the gap filling methodology that works off the government contract and insurance. If CMS is unwilling to change its positions with regards to the PoNS Controller and Mouthpiece reimbursement rates, we may not be able to sell our product profitably, and it could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and negatively affect our financial performance. We are currently in the process of transitioning our manufacturing functions to a new contract manufacturer and any delays in the manufacturing process as a result of this transition could harm our business. We have depended on our third-party contract manufacturing partner, Key Tronic Corporation, to manufacture and supply our PoNS device for clinical and commercial purposes. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company began implementing the transition of the manufacturing of PoNS systems and mouthpieces to Minnetronix, Inc. While the Company expects this transition to be substantially completed by the end of 2024, it is possible that the transition could create delays or disruptions in the manufacturing process. Any delays or disruptions in the manufacturing of our PoNS device during this transition could negatively impact our business. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None.
