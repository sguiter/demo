 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDIN G FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 PSLRA ), Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations, beliefs or intentions regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described below and in Item 1A-Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and described from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable law. We intend that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance. 
 Risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business, include the following: 
 changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence in the United States; 

our ability to successfully develop, implement, and achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transformation Plan (as defined below), including the planned conversion of certain retail stores within our retail segment to dealer sites within our wholesale segment, which may not occur on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; 

significant changes in the current consumption of, and related regulations and litigation related to, cigarettes and other tobacco products; 

changes in the wholesale prices of motor fuel; 

significant changes in demand for fuel-based modes of transportation; 

the highly competitive fragmented industry in which we operate, characterized by many similar competing products and services; 

our ability to make acquisitions and divestitures on economically acceptable terms; 

our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations or otherwise realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions; 

negative events or developments associated with branded motor fuel suppliers; 

we depend on several principal suppliers for our fuel purchases and one principal supplier for merchandise; 

a portion of our revenue is generated under fuel supply agreements with dealers that must be renegotiated or replaced periodically; 

the retail sale, distribution, transportation and storage of motor fuels is subject to environmental protection and operational safety laws and regulations that may expose us or our customers to significant costs and liabilities; 

failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; 

the loss of key senior management personnel or the failure to recruit or retain qualified personnel; 

unfavorable weather conditions; 

payment-related risks that may result in higher operating costs or the inability to process payments; 

significant disruptions of information technology systems, breaches of data security or compromised data; 

evolving laws, regulations, standards, and contractual obligations related to data privacy and security regulations, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations; 

our failure to adequately secure, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights and third-party claims of infringement upon their intellectual property rights; 

our dependence on third-party transportation providers for the transportation of most of our motor fuel; 

3 

Table of Contents 

 our operations present risks which may not be fully covered by insurance; 

our variable rate debt; 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various restrictions and financial covenants; 

the majority of our common stock is held by a limited number of stockholders and management and their interests may conflict with yours; 

our corporate structure includes Israeli subsidiaries that may have adverse tax consequences and expose us to additional tax liabilities; 

we may not be able to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud; 

the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile and could decline significantly; and 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the prices of our common stock to decline.

The Company s operations are primarily performed by its wholly owned subsidiary, GPM Investments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company GPM ). Formed in 2002, GPM is primarily engaged directly and through fully owned and controlled subsidiaries in retail activity, which includes the operations of a chain of convenience stores, most of which include adjacent gas stations. GPM is also engaged in wholesale activity, which includes the supply of fuel to gas stations operated by third-parties and, in fleet fueling, which includes the operation of proprietary and third-party cardlock locations (unstaffed fueling locations) and issuance of proprietary fuel cards that provide customers access to a nationwide network of fueling sites. As of September 30, 2024, GPM s activity included the operation of retail convenience stores, the supply of fuel to gas stations operated by dealers and the operation of cardlock locations, in the District of Columbia and throughout more than states in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwestern, Northeastern, Southeastern and Southwestern United States U.S. ). The Company has four reportable segments: retail, wholesale, fleet fueling, and GPMP. Refer to Note 12 below for further information with respect to the segments.

 or less. The Company evaluates if it is a principal or an agent in a transaction to determine whether revenue should be recorded on a gross or a net basis. In performing this analysis, the Company considers first whether it controls the goods before they are transferred to the customers and if it has the ability to direct the use of the goods or obtain benefits from them. The Company also considers the following indicators: (1) the primary obligor, (2) the latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, and (3) the inventory risk borne by the Company before and after the goods have been transferred to the customer. When the Company acts as principal, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. When the Company acts as agent, revenue is recorded on a net basis. Refer to Note 12 for disclosure of the revenue disaggregated by segment and product line, as well as a description of the reportable segment operations. 

of the limited partnership interests in the Company s subsidiary, GPM Petroleum LP GPMP and all of the rights in the general partner of GPMP. A non-controlling interest had been recorded for the interests owned in GPMP by the seller in the Company s 2019 acquisition of 64 sites from a third-party (the Riiser Seller and was classified in the consolidated statements of changes in equity as Non-controlling interests. At December 31, 2023, the Riiser Seller owed GPM approximately million with respect to a post-closing adjustment, in addition to other amounts, including interest and expenses. The Riiser Seller satisfied million of such adjustment by tendering all of its limited partnership units in GPMP to GPM in January 2024. As a result, GPM, directly and through certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries, holds of the limited partnership interests in GPMP.

 convenience stores and gas stations, (ii) fuel supply rights to dealer locations, (iii) a commercial, government, and industrial business, including certain bulk plants, and (iv) certain distribution and transportation assets, all in the southeastern United States (the TEG Acquisition ). The purchase price for the TEG Acquisition was, as of closing, approximately million, plus the value of inventory at the closing, of which million was to be deferred and payable in two annual payments of million (the Installment Payments ), which the Company was entitled to elect to pay in either cash or, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, shares of common stock (the Installment Shares ), on the first and second anniversaries of the closing. Pursuant to the TEG Purchase Agreement, at closing, ARKO and TEG entered into a registration rights agreement, pursuant to which ARKO agreed to prepare and file a registration statement with the SEC, registering the Installment Shares, if any, for resale by TEG. Pursuant to the TEG Purchase Agreement, on March 1, 2024, the Company issued Installment Shares to TEG in respect of the first installment payment (the First Installment Shares at a price per share of , which was based on the 10-day volume weighted average price calculation contained in the TEG Purchase Agreement. As a result, the Company recorded a gain of approximately million as a component of interest and other financial income in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On March 26, 2024, the Company and TEG entered into a second amendment to the TEG Purchase Agreement (the TEG Purchase Agreement Amendment ), pursuant to which, in full satisfaction of all Installment Payments, (i) the Company repurchased the First Installment Shares from TEG for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash, or per share, and (ii) the Company paid to TEG an additional amount in cash equal to approximately million in satisfaction of the second Installment Payment, which would have otherwise been due on March 1, 2025. The million was financed with the Capital One Line of Credit (refer to Note 5 below). The TEG Purchase Agreement Amendment additionally terminated the registration rights agreement, terminated TEG s indemnity obligations under the TEG Purchase Agreement and extended the transition services agreement entered into between the Company and TEG. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a net gain of approximately million, out of which approximately million was recorded as a component of interest and other financial income in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. WTG Fuels Holdings, LLC On , pursuant to an asset purchase agreement entered on December 6, 2022, certain of the Company s subsidiaries completed the acquisition of certain assets from WTG Fuels Holdings, LLC and certain other sellers party thereto (collectively, WTG ), including (i) Uncle s convenience stores located across Western Texas, and (ii) proprietary GASCARD-branded cardlock sites and private cardlock sites for fleet fueling operations located in Western Texas and Southeastern New Mexico (the WTG Acquisition ). In the second quarter of 2024, the Company updated the initial accounting treatment of the WTG Acquisition, including the valuation of some of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and the goodwill resulting from the acquisition. As a result, the Company primarily reduced property and equipment by approximately million and intangible assets by million, and increased the deferred tax asset by million. The adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in an increase in goodwill of approximately million, which was allocated to the GPMP segment attributable to the opportunity to add significant volume to the GPMP segment. These adjustments resulted in a net increase in depreciation and amortization expenses recorded, approximately million and million of that related to amounts recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. SpeedyQ Acquisition On April 9, 2024, the Company acquired certain assets from a third-party, including SpeedyQ Markets convenience stores and additional landbank sites located in Michigan (the SpeedyQ Acquisition ), pursuant to a purchase agreement entered into on (the SpeedyQ Purchase Agreement ). The consideration at closing was approximately million as adjusted in accordance with terms of the SpeedyQ Purchase Agreement, plus the value of cash and inventory in the stores on the closing date, of which million was financed with the Capital One Line of Credit and approximately million was paid for fee simple ownership in of the properties by Blue Owl Real Estate Fund VI OP LP (f/k/a Oak Street Real Estate Capital Fund VI OP, LP) and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Blue Owl under the standby real estate purchase, designation and lease program agreement (the Program Agreement (as further described in Note 13). At the closing, pursuant to the Program Agreement, the Company entered into a master lease with Blue Owl for the sites Blue Owl acquired under customary lease terms. The Company leases one site from the seller, for which the seller received a put right to require the Company to purchase the site and the Company received a call right to require the seller to sell the site, both for a purchase price of million, subject to terms set forth in the SpeedyQ Purchase Agreement.

The Company included identifiable tangible assets and identifiable liabilities in these interim financial statements at their respective fair values based on the information available to the Company s management on the SpeedyQ Acquisition closing date, including, among other things, a valuation performed by external consultants for this purpose. The useful life of the trade name was estimated at five years.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and were recorded as other current and non-current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Asset Retirement Obligation As part of the fuel operations at its retail convenience stores and proprietary cardlock locations, at most of the other owned and leased locations leased to dealers, certain other dealer locations and private cardlock locations, there are aboveground and underground storage tanks for which the Company is responsible. The future cost to remove a storage tank is recognized over the estimated remaining useful life of the storage tank or the termination of the applicable lease. A liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long-lived asset is recorded at the time a storage tank is installed. The estimated liability is based upon historical experience in removing storage tanks, estimated tank useful lives, external estimates as to the cost to remove the tanks in the future and current and anticipated federal and state regulatory requirements governing the removal of tanks, and discounted. The Company has recorded an asset retirement obligation of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The current portion of the asset retirement obligation is included in other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Program Agreement On September 30, 2024, GPM, together with Blue Owl, entered into a sixth amendment to the Program Agreement, which, among other things, (i) extended the term of the Program Agreement and the exclusivity period thereunder through September 30, 2025, subject to certain early termination events and (ii) provides for up to billion of capacity under the Program Agreement from May 2, 2023 through September 30, 2025, subject to reduction for any amounts Blue Owl funds to GPM in connection with certain other projects that may be entered into between Blue Owl and GPM. The other material terms of the Program Agreement remained substantially unchanged. Potential Wage and Hour Class Action A law firm representing store managers in multiple states sent the Company a letter, alleging that the Company violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and state laws by classifying certain store managers as exempt from overtime. The Company has entered into a tolling agreement with opposing counsel to provide the Company with sufficient time to investigate the allegations. The letter did not quantify any alleged damages but stated that the store managers may seek collective and/or class certification. Given the uncertainty of the result of any litigation and the undetermined nature of the number of putative collective and/or class members, the subset of store managers who would fall into such putative collective and/or class, the number of putative collective members who would participate if a collective was certified, the states for which class certification would be sought and the number of employees at issue in each such alleged class, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result from this action; therefore, no accrual has been made related to this matter. Other Legal Matters The Company is a party to various legal actions, as both plaintiff and defendant, in the ordinary course of business. The Company s management believes, based on estimations with support from legal counsel for these matters, that these legal actions are routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the Company s business and that it is not reasonably probable that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse impact on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Overview 
 ARKO Corp. was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on August 26, 2020. Our shares of common stock, 0.0001 par value per share common stock ), and publicly-traded warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq and trade under the symbols ARKO and ARKOW, respectively. Our wholly owned subsidiary, GPM Investments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on June 12, 2002, which we refer to as GPM, is our primary operating entity. 
 Based in Richmond, VA, we are a leading independent convenience store operator and, as of September 30, 2024, we were the sixth largest convenience store chain in the United States U.S. ranked by store count, operating 1,491 retail convenience stores. As of September 30, 2024, we operated the stores under more than 25 regional store brands including 1-Stop, Admiral, Apple Market , BreadBox, Corner Mart, Dixie Mart, ExpressStop, E-Z Mart , fas mart , fastmarket , Flash Market, Handy Mart, Jetz, Jiffi Stop , Jiffy Stop, Li l Cricket, Market Express, Next Door Store , Pride, Roadrunner Markets, Rose Mart, Rstore, Scotchman , shore stop , Speedy s, SpeedyQ, Town Star, Uncle s, Village Pantry and Young s. As of September 30, 2024, we also supplied fuel to 1,832 dealer locations and operated 281 cardlock locations (unstaffed fueling locations). We are well diversified geographically and as of September 30, 2024, operated in the District of Columbia and more than 30 states in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwestern, Northeastern, Southeastern and Southwestern U.S. 
 Our primary business is the operation of convenience stores, and we generate a significant portion of our revenue from the retail sale of products and fuel at our stores. Consequently, our retail stores generate a large proportion of our profitability. We focus our marketing and merchandising initiatives at our retail stores on offering our customers an assortment of products with an attractive value proposition. Our retail offering includes a wide array of cold and hot foodservice, beverages, cigarettes and other tobacco products, candy, salty snacks, grocery, beer and general merchandise. We have foodservice offerings at approximately 1,190 stores, which include hot and fresh grab-n-go foods, deli, fried chicken, bakery, pizza, roller grill items and other prepared foods. In the first quarter of 2024, we launched an extensive new pizza program that offers private label pizza, at an attractive value of 4.99 for enrolled loyalty members. We currently offer our private label pizza at approximately 1,160 stores as take-and-bake from the freezer, and as fresh and hot pizza either whole or by the slice at approximately 235 stores. We supplement our foodservice offering with approximately 120 quick service major national brand restaurants. Relevant and delicious food offerings are a key strategic priority for us, and we expect to maintain a high degree of focus on frozen grab-n-go and enhanced hot food capabilities. Additionally, we provide a number of traditional convenience store services, including lottery, prepaid products, gift cards, money orders, ATMs, gaming, and other ancillary product and service offerings. We also generate revenues from car washes at approximately 85 of our locations. 
 We had approximately 2.23 million enrolled members in our fas REWARDS loyalty program at the end of the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of approximately 21 from the end of the third quarter of 2023. Our fas REWARDS loyalty program is available in the majority of our stores and offers enrolled loyalty members in store exclusive promotional pricing, in-app member only deals not available without the app, as well as the ability to earn points that can be redeemed for either fuel or merchandise savings. Other in-app features include order and delivery, age verified offers on tobacco and alcohol, and a store locator with current gas prices at GPM stores nearby to members. 
 We also generate revenue from our wholesale distribution of fuel and the sale of fuel at cardlock locations, and we earn commissions from the sales of fuel using proprietary fuel cards that provide customers access to a nationwide network of fueling sites. We believe these revenues provide stable, ratable cash flows that, together with free cash flow from our retail segment, can be deployed to pursue accretive acquisitions and investments in our retail stores. The wholesale segment adds significant fuel volumes to our robust retail fuel sales, which we believe enhances our purchasing power for our entire platform, including our retail segment, and improves our competitiveness as an acquirer of choice. 
 Our reportable segments are described below.

Table of Contents 

 Retail Segment 
 Our retail segment includes the operation of a chain of retail stores, which includes convenience stores selling fuel products and other merchandise to retail customers. At our convenience stores, we own the merchandise and fuel inventory and employ personnel to manage the store. 
 Wholesale Segment 
 Our wholesale segment supplies fuel to dealers, on either a consignment or cost plus basis. For consignment arrangements, we retain ownership of the fuel inventory at the site, are responsible for the pricing of the fuel to the end consumer and share a portion of the gross profit earned from the sale of fuel with the consignment dealers. For cost plus arrangements, we sell fuel to dealers and bulk and spot purchasers on a fixed-fee basis. The sales price is determined according to the terms of the relevant agreement, which typically reflects our total fuel costs plus the cost of transportation and a margin, with us generally retaining the prompt pay discounts and rebates. 
 Fleet Fueling Segment 
 Our fleet fueling segment includes the operation of proprietary and third-party cardlock locations (unstaffed fueling locations), and issuance of proprietary fuel cards that provide customers access to a nationwide network of fueling sites. 
 GPMP Segment 
 Our GPMP segment engages in the wholesale distribution of fuel to substantially all of our sites that sell fuel in the retail and wholesale segments, as well as to a limited number of third-party dealers. GPM Petroleum LP GPMP sells fuel at GPMP s cost of fuel (including taxes and transportation) plus a fixed margin and charges a fixed fee primarily to sites in the fleet fueling segment which are not supplied by GPMP.

Multi-Year Transformation Plan 
 As part of our focus on accelerating organic growth, we are continuing to develop our multi-year transformation plan (the Transformation Plan ), which is expected to include the following elements, among others: 
 (i) Leveraging our unique, multi-segment operating model through more active conversion of retail stores within our retail segment to dealer sites within our wholesale segment. Following our review of our retail store portfolio, we have identified and expect to convert a meaningful number of retail locations to dealer sites, which we expect will yield greater profitability. Conversions of certain retail stores benefit both our dealers and us. Dealers are able to leverage their own scale by taking additional sites, while we realize higher profit from ongoing fuel supply agreements and rental income than from continuing to operate these stores in our retail segment. These conversions also will allow us to focus and better prioritize future investments in our remaining retail stores. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we converted 51 retail stores to dealer sites, and we expect to convert another approximately 100 retail stores by the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. 

(ii) Additional targeted capital allocation toward strategic sub-segments of our retail stores, with a goal of increasing traffic and improving profitability. These investments will be guided by a pilot program currently in development, designed to enhance the customer experience and strengthen our value proposition, potentially including an expanded and refined offering across a larger store network, with a focus on food and an enhanced in-store experience. The pilot will focus on seven stores within one of our regions, with plans for a region-wide rollout before, ultimately, the expansion of this program across our retail footprint. The Company anticipates beginning permitting to implement the new design in the pilot stores in the fourth quarter of 2024, with remodeling activity to commence in early 2025. 

(iii) Increased focused on both our pricing and procurement strategies across our retail stores to support ongoing merchandise margin rate growth. 

As we proceed with this Transformation Plan, we may incur associated non-recurring expenses, including personnel costs, divestiture costs, professional services fees, and losses on disposal of assets and impairment charges. 
 Trends Impacting Our Business 
 We achieved strong store growth over the last decade, driven primarily by a highly successful acquisition strategy, inclusive of 26 completed acquisitions from 2013 through September 30, 2024. On March 1, 2023, we acquired 135 convenience stores and gas stations, 181 dealer locations, a commercial, government, and industrial business, and certain distribution and transportation assets from Transit Energy Group, LLC (the TEG Acquisition ). On June 6, 2023, we completed our acquisition of 24 Uncle s convenience stores located across Western Texas, 68 proprietary GASCARD-branded cardlock sites and 43 private cardlock sites for fleet fueling operations located in Western Texas and Southeastern New Mexico from WTG Fuels Holdings, LLC (the WTG Acquisition ). On August 15, 2023, we acquired seven Speedy s convenience stores located in Arkansas and Oklahoma, which were previously locations operated by a dealer to which we supplied fuel (the Speedy s Acquisition and, together with the TEG Acquisition and the WTG Acquisition, the 2023 Acquisitions ). On April 9, 2024, we completed our acquisition of 21 SpeedyQ Markets convenience stores located in Michigan (the SpeedyQ Acquisition and, together with the Speedy s Acquisition, the Speedy s and SpeedyQ Acquisitions ). Our strategic acquisitions have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our reported results and can make period to period comparisons of results difficult. We believe our significant size and scale aids our efforts to successfully deploy our organic growth strategies in our acquired assets, which we anticipate will result in value accretion. 
 We have expanded our pipeline to eight NTI (new to industry) stores, including two Dunkin locations. During the third quarter of 2024, we opened a NTI Handy Mart store in Newport, North Carolina. We expect to open three more NTI stores later this year, with the balance over the course of 2025. 
 In recent years, the convenience store industry has focused on increasing and improving in-store foodservice offerings, including fresh foods, quick service restaurants and proprietary food offerings. We believe consumers may be more likely to patronize convenience stores that include new and improved food offerings, which may also lead to increased inside merchandise sales or fuel sales. Our current foodservice offering, which varies by store, primarily consists of hot and fresh grab-n-go foods, deli, fried chicken, 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 bakery, pizza, roller grill items and other prepared foods. We have historically relied upon a limited number of franchised quick service restaurants and in-store delis to drive customer traffic. As a result, we believe that our under-penetration of foodservice presents an opportunity to expand foodservice offerings and margin in response to changing consumer behavior. In the first quarter of 2024, we launched an extensive new pizza program, as described above under Overview, and we are working on expansion of our food offering as part of the Transformation Plan described above. 
 Our results of operation are significantly impacted by the retail fuel margins we earn on gallons sold. These fuel margins can change rapidly because they are influenced by many factors including: the wholesale cost of fuel; interruptions in supply caused by severe weather; supply chain disruptions; refinery mechanical failures; and competition in the local markets in which we operate. 
 The cost of our main products, gasoline and diesel fuel, is greatly impacted by the wholesale cost of fuel in the United States. We attempt to pass on wholesale fuel cost changes to our customers through retail price changes; however, we are not always able to do so. Competitive conditions primarily affect the timing of any related increase or decrease in retail prices. As a result, we tend to experience lower fuel margins when the cost of fuel is increasing gradually over a longer period and higher fuel margins when the cost of fuel is declining or more volatile over a shorter period of time. Depending on future market and geopolitical conditions, the supply of fuel, including diesel fuel in particular, may become constrained. Accordingly, we maintain terminal storage of diesel fuel for short-term supply needs for our fleet fueling sites. 
 Additionally, the significant increase in the rate of inflation in the U.S. in recent years and the effect of higher prevailing interest rates has increased merchandise costs and reduced consumer purchasing power. We have mitigated a portion of these higher costs with retail price increases. The persistence of, or increase in, inflation or high interest rates could negatively impact the demand for our products and services, including due to consumers reducing travel, which could reduce sales volumes. Additionally, because of current labor market conditions and the prevailing wage rates in the markets in which we operate, we have increased wages, which has increased our costs associated with recruiting and retaining qualified personnel. 
 We also operate in a highly competitive retail convenience market that includes businesses with operations and services that are similar to those that we provide. We believe that convenience stores managed by individual operators who offer branded or non-branded fuel are also significant competitors in the local markets in which we operate. Often, operators of both chains and individual stores compete by selling unbranded fuel at lower retail prices relative to the market. The convenience store industry is also experiencing competition from other retail sectors including grocery stores, large warehouse retail stores, dollar stores and pharmacies. 
 Seasonality 
 Our business is seasonal, and our operating income in the second and third quarters has historically been significantly greater than in the first and fourth quarters as a result of the generally favorable climate and seasonal buying patterns of our customers. Inclement weather, especially in the Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S. during the winter months, can negatively impact our financial results. 
 Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations contained in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation have been prepared using our condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Financial Statements ). The following discussion should be read in conjunction with such condensed interim consolidated financial statements and related notes. All figures for fuel contribution and fuel margin per gallon exclude the estimated fixed margin or fixed fee paid to GPMP for the cost of fuel (intercompany charges by GPMP). 
 Consolidated Results 
 The table below shows our consolidated results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, together with certain key metrics.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, fuel revenue decreased by 302.5 million, or 14.5 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in fuel revenue was attributable primarily to fewer same store gallons sold in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease in the average price of fuel compared to the third quarter of 2023, which was partially offset by incremental gallons sold related to the Speedy s and SpeedyQ Acquisitions.

 Segment Results 
 Disclosure of Incremental Contributions From Acquisitions 
 In the discussion of our segment results, we disclose certain information with respect to our acquisitions on an incremental basis. For example, incremental fuel gallons sold with respect to recent acquisitions. Incremental amounts or gallons related to such acquisitions reflect only the change (i.e. increase) in the contribution of the acquisitions between the referenced periods. For example, if an acquisition was made in 2023, the amounts attributed to 2023 for that acquisition for the period owned were deducted from such acquisition s 2024 results as presented in the tables below in order to disclose only the change period over period from such acquisition. Because we discuss incremental change in the narratives below, such change may differ from the applicable aggregate information contained in the tables below. 
 When analyzing the incremental impact of the 2023 Acquisitions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, the TEG Acquisition s results for the second and third quarters of 2024 and 2023 and the WTG Acquisition s results for the

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Retail Revenues 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, fuel revenue decreased by 156.6 million, or 14.4 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in fuel revenue was attributable to a decrease in gallons sold at same stores of approximately 6.6 , or 19.2 million gallons, reflecting the challenging macro-economic environment, as well as a 0.33 per gallon decrease in the average retail price of fuel in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to market factors. Partially offsetting this decrease was an incremental 5.0 million gallons sold, or 16.0 million in combined fuel revenue, contributed by the stores acquired in the Speedy s and SpeedyQ Acquisitions. Underperforming retail stores, which we closed or converted to dealers over the last 12 months in order to optimize profitability, also negatively impacted gallons sold during the third quarter of 2024. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, merchandise revenue decreased by 36.8 million, or 7.3 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The Speedy s and SpeedyQ Acquisitions contributed approximately 8.8 million of incremental merchandise revenue. Same store merchandise sales decreased 37.4 million, or 7.7 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily caused by a decline in customer transactions reflecting the challenging macro-economic environment. About half the decline in same store merchandise revenue was caused by lower contribution from cigarettes. In addition, there was a decrease in merchandise revenue from underperforming retail stores that we closed or converted to dealers. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other revenues, net decreased by 3.7 million, or 18.6 , compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily related to the regulatory state-wide elimination of Virginia skill gaming machine income. 
 Retail Operating Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, fuel contribution decreased 4.2 million, or 3.4 , compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in same store fuel contribution of 5.1 million, which was partially offset by incremental fuel contribution from the Speedy s and SpeedyQ Acquisitions of approximately 2.2 million. Same store fuel margin per gallon for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 41.4 cents per gallon from 40.4 cents per gallon for the third quarter of 2023. In addition, a decrease in fuel contribution related to underperforming retail stores that we closed or converted to dealers reduced fuel contribution compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, merchandise contribution decreased 6.7 million, or 4.2 , compared to the same period in 2023, and merchandise margin increased to 32.8 compared to 31.7 in the prior period. The merchandise

 contribution decrease was primarily due to a decrease in same store merchandise contribution of approximately 7.5 million, which was partially offset by 2.7 million in incremental merchandise contribution from the Speedy s and SpeedyQ Acquisitions. Same store merchandise contribution decreased in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower same store sales, which were partially offset by an increase in same store merchandise margin to 32.8 in the third quarter of 2024 from 31.8 in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, a decrease in merchandise contribution related to underperforming retail stores that we closed or converted to dealers reduced merchandise contribution compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, site operating expenses decreased 3.1 million, or 1.5 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in same store operating expenses of 2.8 million, or 1.4 , primarily related to lower personnel costs and lower credit card fees. The decrease in site operating expenses also resulted from underperforming retail stores that were closed or converted to dealers. These decreases were partially offset by 3.8 million of incremental expenses related to the Speedy s and SpeedyQ Acquisitions. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Retail Revenues 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, fuel revenue decreased by 214.7 million, or 7.3 , compared to the first three quarters of 2024. The decrease in fuel revenue was attributable to a 0.17 per gallon decrease in the average retail price of fuel in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the first three quarters of 2023, primarily due to market factors, as well as a decrease in same store gallons sold of approximately 6.6 , or 54.1 million gallons. Partially offsetting this decrease was an incremental 37.6 million gallons sold, or 121.5 million in fuel revenue contributed by the 2023 Acquisitions and the SpeedyQ Acquisition. Underperforming retail stores, which we closed or converted to dealers over the last 12 months in order to optimize profitability, also negatively impacted gallons sold during the first three quarters of 2024. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, merchandise revenue decreased by 32.8 million, or 2.4 , compared to the first three quarters of 2023. The 2023 Acquisitions and the SpeedyQ Acquisition contributed approximately 58.1 million of incremental merchandise revenue. Same store merchandise sales decreased 77.1 million, or 5.7 , for the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the first three quarters of 2023. About half the decline in same store merchandise revenue was caused by lower revenue from cigarettes. In addition, there was a decrease in merchandise revenue from underperforming retail stores that we closed or converted to dealers. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other revenues, net decreased by 7.8 million, or 13.6 , compared to the first three quarters of 2023, primarily related to the regulatory state-wide elimination of Virginia skill gaming machine income, partially offset by additional income from the 2023 Acquisitions and the SpeedyQ Acquisition. 
 Retail Operating Income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, fuel contribution increased 2.0 million, or 0.6 , compared to the same period in 2023. Incremental fuel contribution from the 2023 Acquisitions and the SpeedyQ Acquisition of approximately 15.0 million was partially offset by a decrease in same store fuel contribution of 11.2 million. Same store fuel margin per gallon for the first three quarters of 2024 increased to 40.0 cents per gallon from 38.7 cents per gallon for the first three quarters of 2023. In addition, a decrease in fuel contribution related to underperforming retail stores that we closed or converted to dealers decreased fuel contribution compared to the first three quarters of 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, merchandise contribution increased 6.3 million, or 1.4 , compared to the same period in 2023, and merchandise margin increased to 32.7 compared to 31.5 in the prior period. The increase was due to 19.7 million in incremental merchandise contribution from the 2023 Acquisitions and the SpeedyQ Acquisition which was partially offset by a decrease in same store merchandise contribution of approximately 10.8 million. Same store merchandise contribution decreased in the first three quarters of 2024 primarily due to lower contribution from several core destination categories and cigarettes, partially offset by higher contribution from other tobacco products. Same store merchandise margin was 32.6 in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to 31.6 in the first three quarters of 2023. In addition, a decrease in merchandise contribution related to underperforming retail stores that we closed or converted to dealers decreased merchandise contribution compared to the first three quarters of 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, site operating expenses increased 24.2 million, or 4.2 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 29.7 million of incremental expenses related to the 2023 Acquisitions and the SpeedyQ Acquisition. Same store operating expenses increased 1.8 million, or 0.3 , with the increase related to accelerated repairs and maintenance and elevated workers compensation claims related to first quarter 2024 events, offset by lower credit card fees. The increase in site operating expenses was partially offset by underperforming retail stores that we closed or converted to dealers.

 Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
 We disclose certain measures on a same store basis, which is a non-GAAP measure. Information disclosed on a same store basis excludes the results of any store that is not a same store for the applicable period. A store is considered a same store beginning in the first quarter in which the store had a full quarter of activity in the prior year. We believe that this information provides greater comparability regarding our ongoing operating performance. Neither this measure nor those described below should be considered an alternative to measurements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). 
 We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by excluding the gain or loss on disposal of assets, impairment charges, acquisition and divestiture costs, share-based compensation expense, other non-cash items, and other unusual or non-recurring charges. Both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. 
 We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for operational and financial decision-making and believe these measures are useful in evaluating our performance because they eliminate certain items that we do not consider indicators of our operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used by many of our investors, securities analysts, and other interested parties in evaluating our operational and financial performance across reporting periods. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors by allowing an understanding of key measures that we use internally for operational decision-making, budgeting, evaluating acquisition targets, and assessing our operating performance. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income or any other financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 
 Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, same store measures, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. It therefore may not be possible to compare our use of these non-GAAP financial measures with those used by other companies. 
 The following table contains a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

(f) Eliminates fair value adjustments to the contingent consideration owed to the seller for the 2020 Empire acquisition. 

(g) Eliminates other unusual or non-recurring items that we do not consider to be meaningful in assessing operating performance. 

(h) Non-cash rent expense reflects the extent to which our GAAP rent expense recognized exceeded (or was less than) our cash rent payments. GAAP rent expense varies depending on the terms of our lease portfolio. For newer leases, our rent expense recognized typically exceeds our cash rent payments, whereas, for more mature leases, rent expense recognized is typically less than our cash rent payments. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, availability under our credit facilities and our cash balances. Our principal liquidity requirements are the financing of current operations, funding capital expenditures (including acquisitions), and servicing debt. We finance our inventory purchases primarily from customary trade credit aided by relatively rapid inventory turnover, as well as cash generated from operations. Rapid inventory turnover allows us to conduct operations without the need for large amounts of cash and working capital. We largely rely on internally generated cash flows and borrowings for operations, which we believe are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. 
 Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, as well as the cost of acquisitions, will depend on our future operating performance which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. As a normal part of our business, we will from time to time consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance our indebtedness, depending on market conditions. Changes in our operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions, or other events may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods. Additional debt financing could impose increased cash payment obligations, as well as covenants that may restrict our operations. There can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 49 of our debt bore interest at variable rates, an increase from approximately 46 as of December 31, 2023, which has increased our interest rate risk and may require that we use more of our cash flow for the payment of interest if prevailing interest rates increase or we incur additional indebtedness under our variable rate facilities or otherwise. See also Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in a strong liquidity position of approximately 869 million, consisting of approximately 292 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately 577 million of availability under our lines of credit available for certain purposes. This liquidity position currently provides us with adequate funding to satisfy our contractual and other obligations from our existing cash balances. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 140.0 million PNC Line of Credit (as defined below), 27.1 million of unused availability under the M T equipment line of credit, described below, and 418.7 million of unused availability under our 800 million Capital One Line of Credit (as defined below), which we may elect to increase up to 1.0 billion, subject to obtaining additional financing commitments from current lenders or other banks, and subject to certain other terms.

 The Board declared, and the Company paid, dividends of 0.03 per share of common stock on each of March 21, 2024, May 31, 2024 and August 30, 2024, totaling approximately 10.5 million. Additionally, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of 0.03 per share of common stock to be paid on December 3, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 19, 2024. The amount and timing of dividends payable on our common stock are within the sole discretion of our Board, which will evaluate dividend payments within the context of our overall capital allocation strategy on an ongoing basis, giving consideration to our current and forecast earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends or the amounts of such dividends. 
 In May 2024, the Board increased the size of our share repurchase program for up to an aggregate of 125.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, from an aggregate of 100.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, inclusive of the repurchase of the First Installment Shares from TEG, we repurchased approximately 4.8 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for approximately 28.3 million, or an average share price of 5.89. The share repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date. Whether and the extent to which we repurchase shares depends on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors management may deem relevant. The timing, volume, and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws, and other factors, and the program may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases, including pursuant to a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)of the Exchange Act, privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to accelerated share repurchase agreements entered into with one or more counterparties, or otherwise. 
 To date, we have funded capital expenditures primarily through funds generated from operations, funds received from vendors, sale-leaseback transactions, the issuance of debt and existing cash. Future capital required to finance operations, acquisitions, and raze-and-rebuild, functionally remodel and fully remodel and update stores is expected to come from cash on hand, cash generated by operations, availability under lines of credit, and additional long-term debt and equipment leases, as circumstances may dictate. In the short- to medium-term, we currently expect that our capital spending program will be primarily focused on remodeling and updating stores, including as part of our Transformation Plan, and maintaining our properties and equipment. In the medium- to long-term, we currently expect that our capital spending program will align with our Transformation Plan. We do not expect such capital needs to adversely affect liquidity. We are always opportunistic on expansion of our store base thorough acquisitions and will evaluate such opportunities in concert with our capital spending program.

Operating Activities 
 Cash flows provided by operations are our main source of liquidity. We have historically relied primarily on cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as necessary from time to time by borrowings on our credit facilities and other debt or equity transactions to finance our operations and to fund our capital expenditures. Cash flow provided by operating activities is primarily impacted by our net income and changes in working capital. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flows provided by operating activities were 199.1 million compared to 78.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of approximately 25.0 million of lower net tax payments, approximately 18.0 million of deposits received from dealers related to retail stores that were or will be converted, incremental vendor incentives received and changes in working capital as a result of the day of the week on which the third quarter of 2024 ended, which were partially offset by approximately 8.9 million of higher net interest payments and a decrease in

Table of Contents 

 Adjusted EBITDA of 22.5 million. In addition, cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflected the impact of a delay in receiving approximately 12.7 million from a vendor. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect capital expenditures for acquisitions and replacing and maintaining existing facilities and equipment used in the business. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities decreased by 182.5 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we utilized 77.8 million for capital expenditures, including the purchase of certain fee properties, upgrades to fuel dispensers and other investments in our stores. We paid 9.5 million in net consideration for the SpeedyQ Acquisition, reflecting 54.5 million in aggregate purchase consideration, offset by 45.0 million paid by an affiliate of Blue Owl Real Estate Fund VI OP LP under the Company s standby real estate purchase, designation and lease program agreement. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by the purchase consideration for the TEG Acquisition and the WTG Acquisition. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash flows from financing activities primarily consist of increases and decreases in the principal amount of our lines of credit and debt, issuance of common stock and preferred stock, net of dividends paid and common stock repurchases. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities consisted primarily of net receipts of 27.0 million for long-term debt, repayments of 3.6 million for financing leases, 10.5 million for dividend payments on common stock, 4.3 million for dividend payments on the Series A redeemable preferred stock and 32.0 million for common stock repurchases, including the repurchase of the First Installment Shares originally issued to pay deferred consideration in the TEG Acquisition. We also made an early payment of 17.2 million, as payment in full and as a discount to the 25.0 million deferred consideration in the TEG Acquisition which would have been due on March 1, 2025. See Note 4 to our Quarterly Financial Statements. 
 Credit Facilities and Senior Notes 
 Senior Notes 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding 450 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.125 Senior Notes due 2029 (the Senior Notes ). Issued in October 2021, the Senior Notes are guaranteed, on an unsecured senior basis, by certain of the Company s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (the Guarantors ). The indenture governing the Senior Notes contains customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, generally limit the ability of the Company and substantially all of its subsidiaries to (i) create liens, (ii) pay dividends, acquire shares of capital stock and make payments on subordinated debt, (iii) place limitations on distributions from certain subsidiaries, (iv) issue or sell the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, (v) sell assets, (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates, (vii) effect mergers and (viii) incur indebtedness. The Senior Notes and the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company s and the Guarantors respective existing and future senior unsubordinated indebtedness and are effectively subordinated to all of the Company s and the Guarantors existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness; and are structurally subordinated to any existing and future obligations of subsidiaries of the Company that are not Guarantors. 
 Financing Agreement with PNC 
 GPM and certain subsidiaries have a financing arrangement (as amended, the PNC Credit Agreement with PNC Bank National Association PNC to provide a line of credit with an aggregate principal amount of up to 140 million for purposes of financing working capital (the PNC Line of Credit ). 
 The PNC Line of Credit bears interest, as elected by GPM at: (a) SOFR Adjusted plus Term SOFR (as defined in the PNC Credit Agreement) plus a margin of 1.25 to 1.75 or (b) a rate per annum equal to the alternate base rate (as defined in the PNC Credit Agreement) plus a margin of 0 to 0.50 . Every quarter, the SOFR margin rate and the alternate base rate margin rate are updated based on the quarterly average undrawn availability of the line of credit. The calculation of the availability under the PNC Line of Credit is determined monthly subject to terms and limitations as set forth in the PNC Credit Agreement, taking into account the balances of receivables, inventory and letters of credit, among other things. As of September 30, 2024, 8.2 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the PNC Credit Agreement. 
 Financing Agreements with M T Bank 
 As of September 30, 2024, GPM has a financing arrangement with M T Bank that provides a line of credit for up to 45.0 million to purchase equipment on or before September 2026, which may be borrowed in tranches, as well as an aggregate original 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 principal amount of 49.5 million of real estate loans (the M T Term Loans ). As of September 30, 2024, approximately 27.1 million remained available under the equipment line of credit. 
 Each additional equipment loan tranche under such financing agreement will have a term of up to five years from the date it is advanced, payable in equal monthly payments of principal plus interest of SOFR (as defined in the agreement) plus 2.75 . The M T Term Loans bear interest at SOFR Adjusted (as defined in the agreement) plus 2.75 to 3.00 (depending on the loan), mature in June 2026 or November 2028 (depending on the loan) and are payable in monthly installments based on a fifteen-year amortization schedule, with the balance of each loan payable at maturity. 
 Financing Agreement with a Syndicate of Banks Led by Capital One, National Association Capital One 
 GPMP has a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Capital One, National Association, in an aggregate principal amount of up to 800 million (the Capital One Line of Credit ). At GPMP s request, the Capital One Line of Credit can be increased up to 1.0 billion, subject to obtaining additional financing commitments from current lenders or from other banks, and subject to certain terms as detailed in the Capital One Line of Credit. The Capital One Line of Credit is available for general GPMP purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions. 
 On March 26, 2024, GPMP, Capital One and the guarantors and lenders party thereto entered into an amendment to the Capital One Line of Credit, to facilitate the borrowing and use of up to 36.5 million of the Capital One Line of Credit for the settlement of the Installment Payments as provided for in the TEG Purchase Agreement Amendment. The other material terms of the Capital One Line of Credit remained unchanged. The Capital One Line of Credit matures on May 5, 2028. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 380.8 million was drawn on the Capital One Line of Credit, 0.5 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Capital One Line of Credit and approximately 418.7 million was available thereunder. 
 The Capital One Line of Credit bears interest, as elected by GPMP at: (a) Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the agreement) plus a margin of 2.25 to 3.25 or (b) a rate per annum equal to the alternate base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus a margin of 1.25 to 2.25 . The margin is determined according to a formula in the Capital One Line of Credit that depends on GPMP s leverage. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We have limited exposure to commodity price risk as a result of the payment and volume-related discounts in certain of our fuel supply contracts with our fuel suppliers, which are based on the market price of motor fuel. Significant increases in fuel prices could result in significant increases in the retail price of fuel and in lower sales to consumers and dealers. When fuel prices rise, some of our dealers may have insufficient credit to purchase fuel from us at their historical volumes. In addition, significant and persistent increases in the retail price of fuel could also diminish consumer demand, which could subsequently diminish the volume of fuel we distribute. A significant percentage of our sales are made with the use of credit cards. Because the interchange fees we pay when credit cards are used to make purchases are based on transaction amounts, higher fuel prices at the pump and higher gallon movements result in higher credit card expenses. These additional fees increase operating expenses. We make use of derivative commodity instruments to manage risks associated with an immaterial number of gallons designed to offset changes in the price of fuel that are directly tied to firm commitments to purchase diesel fuel. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We may be subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing, and cash management activities. The Senior Notes bear a fixed interest rate, therefore, an increase or decrease in prevailing interest rates has no impact on our debt service for the Senior Notes. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on our Capital One Line of Credit was 8.1 , the interest rate on our M T Term Loans was 8.3 and the interest rate on the variable portion of our M T equipment loan was 8.1 (approximately 13.7 million of the total loan). As of September 30, 2023, the interest rate on our Capital One Line of Credit was 7.9 , the interest rate on our M T Term Loan was 8.4 and the interest rate on the variable portion of our M T equipment loan was 8.1 . As of September 30, 2024, approximately 49 of our debt bore interest at variable rates. Based on the 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024, if our applicable interest rates increase by 1 , then our debt service on an annual basis would increase by approximately 4.4 million. Interest rates on commercial bank borrowings and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. Although this could limit our ability to raise funds in the debt capital markets, we expect to remain competitive with respect to acquisitions and capital projects, as our competitors would likely face similar circumstances. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes to the Company s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the calendar quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
