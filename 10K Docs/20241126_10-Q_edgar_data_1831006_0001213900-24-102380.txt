. The Company
was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination ). 

The
Company, defined below, is an emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging
growth companies. 

The
Company has one subsidiary, BLUA Merger Sub LLC, (collectively the Company a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the SPAC
incorporated in Texas on July 17, 2023. As of and for the year ended September 30, 2024, the subsidiary has had no activity. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from October 19, 2020 (inception) through
September 30, 2024 relates to the Company s formation, the initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, searching for a business combination. The Company will not generate any
operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating
income in the form of interest income on its cash and investments held in the trust account from the proceeds of its Initial Public Offering. 

The
Company s sponsor is BlueRiver Ventures, LLC, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the Sponsor ). The registration statement
for the Company s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on January 28, 2021. On February 2, 2021, the Company consummated
its Initial Public Offering of units (each, a Unit and collectively, the Units and, with respect
to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ), including additional
Units to cover over-allotments (the Over-Allotment Units ), at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of million,
and incurring offering costs of approximately million, inclusive of approximately million in deferred underwriting commissions
(Note 5). 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement Private Placement of 
units (each, a Private Placement Unit and collectively, the Private Placement Units ), at a price of 
per Private Placement Unit with the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of approximately million (Notes 4 and 6). 

Upon
the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, million per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial
Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account Trust Account with
Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in United States government securities 
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ),
having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i)
the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. On March 28, 2023, the Company
initiated the process of converting all of the assets held in the Trust Account into cash, which was deposited in a non-interest bearing
account. As of May 4, 2023, the Company deposited the assets held in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account
at a bank. Interest on such deposit account is expected to be approximately per annum, but such deposit account carries a variable
rate and the Company cannot provide assurances that such rate will not decrease or increase significantly. 

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering
and the sale of Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating
a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company
must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least of the net assets held
in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount) at the time of the signing of the agreement to enter
into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company
owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target business or otherwise acquires a controlling interest
in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the
funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay income taxes). The per-share amount to be distributed
to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay
to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5). These Public Shares will be classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial
Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business
Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, only
if a majority of the ordinary shares, represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voted at a shareholder meeting
are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements
and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to the amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association which the Company will adopt upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering (the
 Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules
of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a
Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder
approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to
the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares
irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in
connection with a Business Combination, the initial shareholders (as defined below) agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined below
in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination or to not vote
at all. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company will adopt an insider trading policy which will require
insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public
information and (ii) to clear all trades with the Company s legal counsel prior to execution. In addition, the initial shareholders
agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, private placement shares (the Private Placement
Shares underlying the Private Placement Units and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of its Business Combination and does not conduct redemptions in connection with
its Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association will provide
that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in
concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of of the Class A ordinary shares
sold in the Initial Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The
Company s Sponsor, officers and directors (the initial shareholders agreed not to propose an amendment to the Amended
and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association that would (a) modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to
provide holders of its Public Shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 
of the Company s Public Shares if the Company does not complete its Business Combination within months (including 6 month extensions
approved on January 31, 2023, August 2, 2023 and February 2, 2024) from the closing of this offering, or up to months if extended
6 times by an additional month each month after the closing of this offering, by resolution of the Board, or during any Extension Period
(as such period may be extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles
of Association, the Combination Period or (b) with respect to any other material provision relating to the rights of Public
Shareholders, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in conjunction
with any such amendment.

of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will
completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions,
if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders
and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to the Company s obligations
under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption
rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to
consummate a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 

The
initial shareholders agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Private Placement Shares held by
them if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the initial shareholders acquire
Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with
respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters
agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company
does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other
funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution,
it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only
 per share initially held in the Trust Account or potentially less. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account,
the Sponsor agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold
to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the
amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held
in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than per Public Share due to reductions in
the value of the trust assets. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any
right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Company s
indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable
against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will
seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to
have all vendors, service providers (excluding the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target
businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest
or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

On
July 3, 2024, the NYSE American suspended trading in the redeemable warrants (NYSE: BLUA.U) of the Company (the Public Warrants from NYSE American. On July 15, 2024, the NYSE American suspended trading in the Class A ordinary shares (NYSE American: BLUA) and units
(NYSE American: BLUA.U) of the Company on NYSE American. 

The
NYSE American had previously announced on February 2, 2024 an NYSE Regulation determination to delist all of the Company s listed
securities. On July 12, 2024, the Company withdrew its appeal from the NYSE American and on July 15, 2024, NYSE American filed a Form
25 delisting the Company s securities. 

As
a result of the NYSE American delisting the Company s securities from trading on its exchange, the Company s securities may
be quoted on an over-the-counter market. However, the Company has not made any application to list the Company s units, Class A
ordinary shares or Public Warrants on the over-the-counter markets. Accordingly, the Company could face significant material adverse
consequences, including: (i) a limited availability of market quotations for the Company s units, Class A ordinary shares and Public
Warrants, (ii) reduced liquidity for the Company s units, Class A ordinary shares and Public Warrants, (iii) a determination that
the Company s Public Shares are penny stocks which will require brokers trading in the Company s Public Shares
to adhere to more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities Act, and possibly
result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for the Company s units, Class A ordinary shares
and Public Warrants, (iv) a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future, and (v) a
less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business in connection with an initial business combination. The National Securities
Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities,
which are referred to as covered securities. If the Company is no longer listed on NYSE American, the Company s units,
Class A ordinary shares and Public Warrants would not qualify as covered securities under such statute and we may be subject to regulation
in each state in which we offer our securities.

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain
of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined in

Management
has determined that the Company does not have sufficient funds and may need to borrow from its Sponsor to fund the working capital needs
of the Company until the consummation of an initial Business Combination. 

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern
considerations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about
an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the liquidity condition, mandatory liquidation
and subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have
been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after August 2, 2025. The unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern. The Company intends to complete a Business Combination before the mandatory liquidation date.

Transfers
to/from Levels 1, 2, and 3 are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period. The estimated fair value of the Public Warrants transferred
from a Level 3 measurement to a Level 1 fair value measurement in March 2021 when the Public Warrants were separately listed and traded.
The estimated fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was transferred from a Level 3 measurement to a Level 2 fair value measurement
at the same time as Public Warrants, as the transfer of Private Placement Warrants to anyone who is not a permitted transferee would
result in the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants. The estimated fair value of Public
Warrants was transferred from a Level 1 measurement to a Level 2 measurement due to lack of trading activity as of June 30, 2022. The
Public Warrants were still held at Level 2 as of September 30, 2024. There were no other transfers to/from Levels 1, 2, and 3 during
the period ended September 30, 2024.

contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking

Exchange Commission (the SEC filings. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on October 19, 2020. We were formed for the purpose of effecting
a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses
(the Business Combination ). We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated
with emerging growth companies. 

Our
sponsor is BlueRiver Ventures, LLC, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the Sponsor ). The registration statement for our
initial public offering was declared effective on January 28, 2021 (the Initial Public Offering ). On February 2, 2021,
we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 28,750,000 units (each, a Unit and collectively, the Units 
and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ), including 3,750,000
additional Units to cover over-allotments (the Over-Allotment Units ), at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of
 287.5 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately 16.4 million, inclusive of approximately 10.1 million in deferred underwriting
commissions (Note 5). 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement Private Placement of 800,000 units
(each, a Private Placement Unit and collectively, the Private Placement Units ), at a price of 10.00 per
Private Placement Unit with the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of approximately 8.0 million (Note 4). 

Upon
the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, 287.5 million 10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial
Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account Trust Account ), located
in the United States at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be
invested only in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the
Trust Account as described below. 

Our
management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale
of Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a
Business Combination. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. We must complete one
or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the net assets held in the Trust Account
(excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount) at the time of the signing of the agreement to enter into the initial Business
Combination. However, we will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the
outstanding voting securities of the target business or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for
it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

26 

If
we are unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined in Note 1), we will (i) cease all operations
except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem
the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including
interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to
 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will
completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions,
if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders
and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Cayman Islands
law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating
distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate a Business Combination within the Combination
Period. 

Extension
of Combination Period and Trust Account Redemptions 

On
January 31, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the General Meeting to consider and
vote upon a proposal to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to: (i) extend from February
2, 2023 to August 2, 2023, the date (the Termination Date by which, if the Company has not consummated a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company, with one or more businesses
or entities (a Business Combination ), the Company must (a) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (b)
as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Class A ordinary shares sold in the Company s
initial public offering (the Public Shares and (c) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject
to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to its
obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable
law. In connection with the General Meeting and vote to extend the Termination Date, shareholders elected to redeem 26,738,255 Public
Shares. Following such redemptions, approximately 20,989,598 million remained in the Trust Account and 2,811,745 Public Shares remain
issued and outstanding. 

On
August 2, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the Second General Meeting to consider
and vote upon a proposal to amend BlueRiver s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the Termination
Date from August 2, 2023 to February 2, 2024. In connection with the Second General Meeting and vote to extend the Termination Date,
shareholders elected to redeem 138,816 Public Shares. Following such redemptions, approximately 19,849,725 million remained in the Trust
Account and 1,872,928 Public Shares remain issued and outstanding. 

On
February 2, 2024, BlueRiver held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the Third General Meeting to consider
and vote upon a proposal to amend BlueRiver s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the Termination
Date from February 2, 2024, up to 6 times by an additional 1 month each month after the Original Termination Date, by resolution of our
board of directors, upon deposit of 0.025 into the Company s Trust Account for each Public Share that was not redeemed in connection
with the Third General Meeting until August 2, 2024. In connection with the Third General Meeting and vote to extend the Termination
Date, shareholders elected to redeem 305,218 Public Shares. Following such redemptions, approximately 16,958,072 remained in the Trust
Account and 1,567,710 Public Shares remained outstanding. 

On August 2, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting
of its shareholders. At the Meeting, the Company s shareholders approved the Extension proposal that extends the date to consummate
the Business Combination for up to August 2, 2025 which is 4 times by an additional 3 months each time (Note 10). In connection with such
vote, on August 2, 2024, the holders of an aggregate of 1,475,947 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for an aggregate
of 16,629,41 in cash held in the Trust Account. Following such redemptions, approximately 1,033,888 remained in the Trust Account and
91,673 Public Shares remained outstanding. 

Proposed
Business Combination 

On
July 21, 2023, the Company (including the successor after the Domestication (as defined below), entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the Merger Agreement with BLUA Merger Sub LLC, a Texas limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company Merger Sub ), and Spinal Stabilization Technologies, LLC, a Texas limited liability company SST ).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) the Company will domesticate from a Cayman Islands exempted company to a Delaware corporation (the
 Domestication and (ii) on the Closing Date, following the Domestication, Merger Sub will merge with and into SST (the
 Merger and together with the Domestication and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Business
Combination with SST continuing as the surviving entity of the Merger and a subsidiary of the Company. 

On
October 10, 2023, the Company filed a Registration Statement on form S-4 in relation to the agreement and plan of merger with the Merger
Sub, and SST, which Registration Statement has been subsequently amended but has not yet become effective. 

On
June 28, 2024, SST delivered a termination notice to BlueRiver a copy of which provides for the termination of the Merger Agreement (as
amended by the Amendment). No termination fee or other payment is due to any party to the Merger Agreement from any of the other parties
as a result of the termination. The Sponsor Support Agreement, dated as of July 21, 2023, among the Company, Merger Sub and SST and BlueRiver
Ventures, LLC automatically terminated in accordance with its terms upon termination of the Merger Agreement. No termination fee or other
payment is due to any party to the Sponsor Support Agreement from any of the other parties as a result of the termination.

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 6,035 in cash and a working capital
deficit of approximately 8.0 million. 

Our
liquidity needs to date have been satisfied through a contribution of 25,000 from Sponsor to cover for certain expenses in exchange
for the issuance of the Founder Shares (as defined below in Note 4), the loan of approximately 79,000 from the Sponsor under the Note
(as defined above in Note 4), and the proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account. We repaid
the Note in full on February 5, 2021. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the
Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide us Working Capital
Loans (as defined above in Note 4). On November 9, 2022, we entered into a promissory note agreement Sponsor Note with
our Sponsor, providing us the ability to borrow up to 1.5 million. On November 17, 2022, we drew down 100,000 under the Sponsor Note
agreement. At various dates during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company drew down an additional 722,500 under the Sponsor Note
agreement. At various dates during the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company drew down an additional 677,500 under the Sponsor
Note agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was 1,500,000 and 822,500, respectively, outstanding under Working
Capital Loans. 

Management
has determined that we do not have sufficient funds and may need to borrow from our Sponsor to fund our working capital needs until the
consummation of an initial Business Combination. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the liquidity condition, and mandatory liquidation and
subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the our ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to
the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after August 2, 2025. The unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. We intend
to complete a Business Combination before the mandatory liquidation date. 

Results
of Operations 

Our
entire activity since inception up to September 30, 2024 was in preparation for our formation and the Initial Public Offering, and since
the Initial Public Offering, our search for a prospective target for our Business Combination. We will not be generating any operating
revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of approximately 110,000, which consisted of approximately 195,000 in general
and administrative expenses and 150,000 in general and administrative expenses to related party, partially offset by approximately 136,000
from investment income on the Trust Account and approximately 99,000 change in fair value of derivative liabilities. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net loss of approximately 3,200,000, which consisted of approximately 3,600,000 in
general and administrative expenses and 150,000 in general and administrative expenses to related party and 197,000 change in fair
value of derivative liabilities, offset by approximately 244,000 from investment income on the Trust Account and gain from extinguishment
of deferred underwriting commissions of approximately 362,000. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of approximately 1.5 million, which consisted of approximately 2 million
in general and administrative expenses and 450,000 in general and administrative expenses to related party, partially offset by approximately
 550,000 from investment income on the Trust Account and approximately 394,000 change in fair value of derivative liabilities. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net loss of approximately 4.5 million, which consisted of approximately 296,000 change
in fair value of derivative liabilities, approximately 6.4 million in general and administrative expenses and 450,000 in general and
administrative expenses to related party, partially offset by approximately 800 of change in fair value of working capital loan - related
party, approximately 1.8 million from investment income on the Trust Account and gain from extinguishment of deferred underwriting commissions
of approximately 362,000. 

Contractual
Obligations 

Registration
Rights 

The
holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Units, Private Placement Shares, (as defined above in Note 1) Private Placement Warrants
(as defined above in Note 4), Class A ordinary shares underlying the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon
conversion of working capital loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and
warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Founder Shares and upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans), were entitled to registration
rights pursuant to a registration and shareholder rights agreement signed upon consummation of the Initial Public Offering. The holders
of these securities were entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition,
the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our
completion of its Business Combination. However, the registration and shareholder rights agreement provides that we will not permit any
registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period, which occurs
(i) in the case of the Founder Shares, in accordance with the letter agreement our initial shareholders entered into and (ii) in the
case of the Private Placement Warrants and the respective Class A ordinary shares underlying such warrants, 30 days after the completion
of our Business Combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 

28 

Underwriting
Agreement 

We
granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the final prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 3,750,000
additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions.
The underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option on February 2, 2021. 

The
underwriters were entitled to an underwriting discount of 0.20 per Unit, or approximately 5.8 million in the aggregate, paid upon the
closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, 0.35 per unit, or approximately 10.1 million in the aggregate will be payable
to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts
held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

On
September 21, 2023, Goldman Sachs Co. LLC waived its entitlement to the payment of 10,062,500 deferred underwriting fee in connection
with its role as underwriter in the Company s Initial Public Offering, in respect to any Business Combination. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements,
and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified
the following as our critical accounting estimates: 

Derivative
Warrant Liabilities 

We
do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial
instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify
as embedded derivatives, pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and FASB ASC Subtopic 815-15
 Derivatives and Hedging - Embedded Derivatives ASC 815 ). The classification of derivative instruments, including
whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. 

The
warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants
(as defined in Note 4) (collectively, the warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40.
Accordingly, the Company recognizes the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the carrying value of the instruments
to fair value at each reporting period until they are exercised. The initial fair value of the Public Warrants and the fair value of
the Private Placement Warrants has been estimated using a binomial lattice model in a risk-neutral framework. As the transfer of Private
Placement Warrants to anyone who is not a permitted transferee would result in the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the
same terms as the Public Warrants, the Company determined that the fair value of each Private Placement Warrant is equivalent to that
of each Public Warrant. The fair value of the warrants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is based on observable listed prices
for such warrants. The determination of the fair value of the warrant liability may be subject to change as more current information
becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly. Derivative warrant liabilities are classified as non-current
liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities. 

Convertible
Instruments 

We
accounted for the Working Capital Loans, as described in Note 4, analyzing the conversion options embedded in convertible notes in accordance
with ASC 815. ASC 815 generally requires companies to bifurcate conversion options embedded in convertible notes from their host instruments
and to account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments. 

We
review the terms of convertible debt issued to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, including embedded conversion
options, which are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments. In circumstances where
the host instrument contains more than one embedded derivative instrument, including the conversion option, that is required to be bifurcated,
the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument. 

29 

Bifurcated
embedded derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value
reported as non-operating income or expense. When the equity or convertible debt instruments contain embedded derivative instruments
that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds received are first allocated to the fair value of all
the bifurcated derivative instruments. The remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the host instruments themselves, usually
resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face value. The discount from the face value of the convertible
debt, together with the stated interest on the instrument, is amortized over the life of the instrument through periodic charges to interest
expense. 

It
was determined that the conversion option was de minimis, as such we have recorded the Working Capital Loans at par value. 

Non-redemption
Agreement 

On
January 25, 2023, the Sponsor entered into Non-Redemption Agreements with various shareholders of the Company pursuant to which these
shareholders have committed not to redeem their BLUA shares in connection with the Special Meeting held on January 31, 2023, but still
retained their right to redeem in connection with the closing of the Business Combination. The commitment to not redeem was accepted
by holders of 1,932,000 shares of Class A ordinary shares. In consideration of this agreement, the Sponsor agreed to transfer a portion
of its Class B ordinary shares to the Non-Redeeming Shareholders at the closing of the Business Combination. Each Shareholder committed
to maintain at least 9.9 of the identified stock and in return will obtain 50,000 of the identified shares as Class B ordinary shares.
The Company estimated the aggregate fair value of the 483,000 founders shares attributable to the Non-Redeeming Shareholders to be 1,842,346
or 3.81 per share. Each Non-Redeeming Shareholder acquired from the Sponsor an indirect economic interest in the founder shares. The
excess of the fair value of the founder shares was determined to be an offering cost in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic
5A. Accordingly, in substance, it was recognized by the Company as a capital contribution by the Sponsor to induce these holders of the
Class A shares not to redeem, with a corresponding charge to additional paid-in capital to recognize the fair value of the shares transferred
as an offering cost. 

On July 25, 2023, the Company and the Sponsor, entered into a non-redemption
agreement Non-Redemption Agreement with one or more unaffiliated third party or parties in exchange for such third party
or third parties agreeing not to redeem an aggregate of 200,000 shares of the Company sold in its initial public offering Non-Redeemed
Shares at the special meeting called by the Company (the Second Special Meeting to approve an extension of time
for the Company to consummate an initial business combination (the Second Extension Proposal from August 2, 2023 to February

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

ASU
2024-01, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards ASU
2024-01 introduces updates to accounting standards related to the classification and measurement of financial instruments under
ASC 320. The update primarily focuses on clarifying guidance for equity securities, debt instruments, and other financial assets, particularly
in the areas of fair value measurement and impairment recognition. It aims to improve consistency and comparability in the reporting
of financial instruments by refining the criteria for classifying securities and enhancing the methodology for recognizing and measuring
impairments. ASU 2024- 01 also mandates additional disclosures to provide greater transparency around the valuation techniques and assumptions
used in determining the fair value of financial instruments. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024,
with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements and disclosures. 

Our
management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards updates if currently adopted
would have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

JOBS
Act 

The
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain
reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act
are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies.
We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised
accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result,
the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting
pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

Additionally,
we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions
we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over
financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth
public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted
by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about
the audit and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive
compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive
Officer s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion
of our Initial Public Offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. 

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period ended
September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

PART II
- OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.
Legal Proceedings 

None. 

Item 1A.
Risk Factors 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors
disclosed in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material
changes with respect to those risk factors previously disclosed in our Registration Statement filed with the SEC. We may disclose changes
to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

The
current economic downturn may lead to increased difficulty in completing our initial business combination. 

Our
ability to consummate our initial business combination may depend, in part, on worldwide economic conditions. In recent months, we have
observed increased economic uncertainty in the United States and abroad. Impacts of such economic weakness include: 

falling overall
 demand for goods and services, leading to reduced profitability; 

reduced credit availability; 

higher borrowing costs; 

reduced liquidity; 

volatility in credit, equity
 and foreign exchange markets; and 

bankruptcies. 

These
developments could lead to inflation, higher interest rates, and uncertainty about business continuity, which may adversely affect the
business of our potential target businesses and create difficulties in obtaining debt or equity financing for our initial business combination,
as well as leading to an increase in the number of public stockholders exercising redemption rights in connection therewith. 

Recent
volatility in capital markets and lower market prices for our securities may affect our ability to obtaining financing for our initial
business combination through sales of shares of our common stock or issuance of indebtedness. 

With
uncertainty in the capital markets and other factors, financing for our initial business combination may not be available on terms favorable
to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders
could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to
those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our
capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may limit the operations and growth of the surviving company
of our initial business combination. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, we could
face significant limitations on our ability to complete our initial business combination. 

32 

Changes
to laws or regulations or in how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws, regulations,
interpretations or applications, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business
combination. 

We
are subject to the laws and regulations, and interpretations and applications of such laws and regulations, of national, regional, state
and local governments and non-U.S. jurisdictions. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and potentially other legal
and regulatory requirements, and our consummation of an initial business combination may be contingent upon our ability to comply with
certain laws, regulations, interpretations and applications and any post-business combination company may be subject to additional laws,
regulations, interpretations and applications. Compliance with, and monitoring of, the foregoing may be difficult, time consuming and
costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time, and those changes could
have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete an initial business combination. A failure
to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including
our ability to negotiate and complete an initial business combination. 

On
March 30, 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules (the SPAC Rule Proposals relating, among other items, to disclosures in
SEC filings in connection with business combination transactions involving special purpose acquisition companies SPACs and private operating companies; the financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; the use of
projections in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions; the potential liability of certain participants
in proposed business combination transactions; and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment
Company Act, including a proposed rule that would provide SPACs a safe harbor from treatment as an investment company if they satisfy
certain conditions that limit a SPAC s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities. Certain of the procedures
that we, a potential Business Combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with the SPAC Rule Proposals, as
proposed or as adopted, or pursuant to the SEC s views expressed in the SPAC Rule Proposals, may increase the costs and time of
negotiating and completing an initial business combination, and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial
business combination. 

How
are the funds in the Trust Account currently being held? 

The
funds in the Trust Account were, after our IPO, held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less
or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act. However, on March 28, 2023, the Company initiated the process of converting all of the assets held in the
Trust Account into cash, which was deposited in a non-interest bearing account. As of May 4, 2023. the Company deposited the assets held
in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank. Interest on such deposit account is expected to be approximately
4.6 per annum, but such deposit account carries a variable rate and the Company cannot provide assurances that such rate will not decrease
or increase significantly.. 

Our
cash position could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash are unable to meet their obligations. 

Our
working capital account is currently at First Republic Bank. First Republic Bank has been negatively affected by the recent turmoil in
the banking sector, which included the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC being appointed as receiver of Silicon
Valley Bank on March 10, 2023 and Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. on March 12, 2023. On May 1, 2023, First Republic Bank
became insolvent. Federal regulators seized the assets of the bank and negotiated a sale of its assets to JP Morgan Chase. While as a
result of the sale of the assets to JP Morgan Chase, the Company believes its insured and uninsured deposits are not at risk, there can
be no assurance as to the outcome of the current turmoil in the banking sector. There is no guarantee that the Treasury, FDIC and Federal
Reserve Board will provide access to uninsured funds in the future in the event of the closure or receivership of other banks or financial
institutions, or that they would do so in a timely fashion. We may open a working capital account at a different financial institution
and move the cash balance held at First Republic Bank to such new account, but we cannot guarantee that such a transfer will occur or
that such financial institution would be insulated from the effect of the recent turmoil in the banking sector.

Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

Initial
Public Offering 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the Private Placement of 800,000 units at a price of 10.00 per Private
Placement Unit with the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of approximately 8.0 million (Note 4). 

In
connection with the Initial Public Offering, our sponsor had agreed to loan us an aggregate of up to 300,000 pursuant to the Note. This
loan is non-interest bearing and payable on the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. As of March 31, 2022, the loan balance was
 0. 

Of
the gross proceeds received from the Initial Public Offering and the full exercise of the option to purchase additional Shares, 287,500,000
was placed in the Trust Account. The net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain proceeds from the Private Placement are
invested in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less and in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. 

We
paid a total of approximately 6.1 million in underwriting discounts and commissions related to the Initial Public Offering. In addition,
the underwriters agreed to defer 10.1 million in underwriting discounts and commissions. 

On
September 21, 2023, Goldman Sachs Co. LLC waived its entitlement to the payment of such 10.1 million deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions in respect to any business combination. 

Third
Special Meeting 

In
connection with the Third Special Meeting held on February 2, 2024, the holders of an aggregate of 305,218 Public Shares exercised their
