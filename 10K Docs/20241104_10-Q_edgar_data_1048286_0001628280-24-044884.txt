 million restricted stock units RSUs during the 2024 first three quarters to certain officers and employees, and those units vest generally over in equal annual installments commencing after the grant date. We also granted million performance-based RSUs PSUs in the 2024 first three quarters to certain executives, which are earned subject to continued employment and the satisfaction of certain performance and market conditions based on the degree of achievement of pre-established targets for 2026 adjusted EBITDA performance and relative total stockholder return over the 2024 to 2026 performance period. RSUs, including PSUs, granted in the 2024 first three quarters had a weighted average grant-date fair value of per unit. 
 We recorded stock-based compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs of million in the 2024 third quarter, million in the 2023 third quarter, million in the 2024 first three quarters, and million in the 2023 first three quarters. Deferred compensation costs for unvested awards for RSUs and PSUs totaled million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023.

 Contingent Purchase Obligation 
 Sheraton Grand Chicago . In 2017, we granted the owner a one-time right to require us to purchase the leasehold interest in the land and the hotel for million in cash (the put option ). In the 2021 third quarter, we entered into an amendment with the owner to move the exercise period of the put option from the 2022 first half to the 2024 first half. In January 2024, the owner exercised the put option, and we exercised our option to purchase, at the same time the put transaction closes, the fee simple interest in the underlying land for an additional million in cash, resulting in an expected total cash payment of approximately million. The closing is expected to occur in the 2024 fourth quarter. We account for the put option as a guarantee, and our recorded liability (reflected in the Accrued expenses and other caption of our Balance Sheets) was million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

lawsuits were filed by consumers and others against us in U.S. federal, U.S. state and Canadian courts related to the incident. The plaintiffs in the cases that remain pending, who generally purport to represent various classes of consumers, generally claim to have been harmed by alleged actions and/or omissions by the Company in connection with the Data Security Incident and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys fees, and other related relief. The active U.S. cases are consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (the District Court ), pursuant to orders of the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the MDL ). The District Court granted in part and denied in part class certification of various U.S. groups of consumers. In August 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (the Fourth Circuit vacated the District Court s class certification decision because the District Court failed to first consider the effect of a class-action waiver signed by all putative class members. On remand, after briefing, the District Court issued an order reinstating the same classes that had previously been certified. We promptly petitioned the Fourth Circuit, seeking leave to appeal that ruling. The Fourth Circuit granted that petition on January 18, 2024, oral argument was held on November 1, 2024, and we await a decision. A case brought by the City of Chicago (which is consolidated in the MDL proceeding) also remains pending. The Canadian cases have effectively been consolidated into a single case in the province of Ontario. We dispute the allegations in these lawsuits and are vigorously defending against such claims. 
 In addition, various U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign governmental authorities made inquiries, opened investigations, or requested information and/or documents related to the Data Security Incident and related matters. Most of these matters have been resolved or no longer appear to be active. In October 2024, we reached final resolutions with the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General offices from 49 states and the District of Columbia (the AG Offices ). Among other terms, the resolution with the AG Offices includes a million monetary payment, which we have fully accrued for as of September 30, 2024, and which is not material to our Financial Statements. We do not expect the terms of these resolutions to have a material impact on our current or ongoing operations. 
 While we believe it is reasonably possible that we may incur losses in excess of the amounts recorded associated with the above described MDL proceedings and unresolved regulatory investigations related to the Data Security Incident, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount of such losses or range of loss in excess of the amounts recorded that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other resolution of these proceedings and investigations based on: (1) in the case of the above described MDL proceedings, the current stage of these proceedings, the absence of specificity as to alleged damages, the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class, and the lack of resolution of significant factual and legal issues, and (2) uncertainty regarding unresolved inquiries, investigations, or requests for information and/or documents. 
 Other Legal Proceedings 
 During the 2024 third quarter, we recorded certain expenses related to settled and ongoing claims brought against the Company regarding the use of copyrighted music. These amounts are not material to our Financial Statements. While we believe it is reasonably possible that we may incur losses in excess of the amounts already recorded for the unresolved claims, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the amount of losses or range of

 We are party to a billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Facility ). Available borrowings under the Credit Facility support our commercial paper program and general corporate needs. U.S. dollar borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a spread based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. We classify outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and outstanding commercial paper borrowings (which generally have short-term maturities of 45 days or less) as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis. The Credit Facility expires on December 14, 2027.

We revised the prior period amounts shown in the tables below to conform to our current presentation. 
 We evaluate the performance of our operating segments using segment profits, which is based largely on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, income taxes, indirect general, administrative, and other expenses, or certain restructuring and merger-related charges. We assign gains and losses, equity in earnings or losses, and direct general, administrative, and other expenses to each of our segments. Unallocated corporate and other includes a portion of our revenues (such as fees we receive from our credit card programs and vacation ownership licensing agreements), revenues and expenses for our Loyalty Program, general, administrative, and other expenses, certain restructuring and merger-related charges, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that we do not allocate to our segments, as well as results of our CALA operating segment. 
 Our CODM monitors assets for the consolidated Company but does not use assets by operating segment when assessing performance or making operating segment resource allocations.

 Cautionary Statement 
 All statements in this report are made as of the date this Form 10-Q is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We make forward-looking statements in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information available to us through the date this Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements include information related to our development pipeline; our expectations regarding rooms growth; our expectations regarding our ability to meet our liquidity requirements; our capital expenditures and other investment spending and reimbursement expectations; our expectations regarding future dividends and share repurchases; our expectations regarding certain claims, legal proceedings, settlements or resolutions; our comprehensive initiative to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency across the Company, including related plans and goals, anticipated charges and cost reductions, and other expected or potential benefits and outcomes; and other statements that are preceded by, followed by, or include the words believes, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, estimates, foresees, or similar expressions; and similar statements concerning anticipated future events and expectations that are not historical facts. 
 We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to numerous evolving risks and uncertainties that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the risks and uncertainties we describe in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ), Part II, Item 1A of this report, and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC. 
 
 BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW 
 Overview 
 We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, timeshare, and other lodging properties under more than 30 brand names. Under our asset-light business model, we typically manage or franchise 
 15 

Table of Contents 

hotels, rather than own them . We discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments: (1) U.S. Canada, (2) Europe, Middle East Africa EMEA ), (3) Greater China, and (4) Asia Pacific excluding China APEC ). Our Caribbean Latin America CALA operating segment does not meet the applicable criteria for separate disclosure as a reportable business segment, and as such, we include its results in Unallocated corporate and other. 
 Terms of our management agreements vary, but our management fees generally consist of base management fees and incentive management fees. Base management fees are typically calculated as a percentage of property-level revenue. Incentive management fees are typically calculated as a percentage of a hotel profitability measure, and, in many cases (particularly in our U.S. Canada, Europe, and CALA regions), are subject to a specified owner return. Under our franchise and license agreements for most properties, franchise fees are calculated as a percentage of property-level revenue or a portion thereof. Additionally, we earn franchise fees for the use of our intellectual property, including primarily co-branded credit card fees, as well as timeshare and yacht fees, residential branding fees, franchise application and relicensing fees, and certain other non-hotel licensing fees. 
 Performance Measures 
 We believe Revenue per Available Room RevPAR ), which we calculate by dividing property level room revenue by total rooms available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues, and should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate ADR ), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing total rooms sold by total rooms available for the period, measures the utilization of a property s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property level room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels. RevPAR, occupancy, and ADR statistics are on a systemwide basis for comparable properties, unless otherwise stated. Unless otherwise stated, all changes refer to year-over-year changes for the comparable period. Comparisons to prior periods are on a constant U.S. dollar basis, which we calculate by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period. We believe constant dollar analysis provides valuable information regarding our properties performance as it removes currency fluctuations from the presentation of such results. 
 We define our comparable properties as our properties that were open and operating under one of our hotel brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since January 1, 2023 for the current period) and have not, in either the current or previous year: (1) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (2) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (3) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. Our comparable properties also exclude MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy, Design Hotels, The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, and timeshare properties. 
 
 Business Trends 
 We saw solid global RevPAR growth during the 2024 third quarter and 2024 first three quarters compared to the same periods in 2023. For the 2024 third quarter, worldwide RevPAR increased 3.0 percent, reflecting ADR growth of 2.5 percent and occupancy improvement of 0.3 percentage points. For the 2024 first three quarters, worldwide RevPAR increased 4.0 percent, reflecting ADR growth of 2.7 percent and occupancy improvement of 0.9 percentage points. The increase in RevPAR in the 2024 third quarter and 2024 first three quarters was primarily driven by strong year-over-year demand growth in nearly all of our regions. 
 In the U.S. Canada, where demand has normalized, RevPAR increased 2.6 percent in the 2024 first three quarters, led by strong group business. 
 In EMEA, RevPAR growth of 9.4 percent in the 2024 first three quarters was driven by strong demand across the region, strengthened by the 2024 Paris Olympics and other special events. In APEC, RevPAR increased 13.3 percent in the 2024 first three quarters, driven by strong growth in ADR and occupancy, including an increase in inbound demand into the region. In CALA, RevPAR increased 9.3 percent in the 2024 first three quarters, driven by strong demand throughout the region. In Greater China, RevPAR declined 2.7 percent in the 2024 first three

quarters and 7.9 percent in the 2024 third quarter due to lower domestic demand as a result of macro-economic conditions, severe weather, and an increase in outbound travel. 
 
 Earlier this year, we launched a comprehensive initiative to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency across the Company. At this point in the process, we expect this initiative to yield 80 million to 90 million of annual general and administrative cost reductions beginning in 2025. These efforts are also anticipated to deliver cost savings to our owners and franchisees. 
 As part of these efforts, we implemented a voluntary retirement program for certain above-property associates in the 2024 third quarter, and we also expect that some above-property roles in the organization will be eliminated or redefined going forward. We anticipate charges for employee termination benefits related to the above efforts primarily in the 2024 fourth quarter and expect to substantially complete this initiative by the end of the 2025 first quarter. 
 
 Starwood Data Security Incident 
 On November 30, 2018, we announced a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the Starwood reservations database (the Data Security Incident ). We are currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of total possible financial impact to the Company from the Data Security Incident in excess of the expenses already recorded; however, we do not believe this incident will impact our long-term financial health. See Note 5 for additional information related to legal proceedings and governmental investigations related to the Data Security Incident. 
 
 System Growth and Pipeline 
 At the end of the 2024 third quarter, our system had 9,068 properties (1,674,600 rooms), compared to 8,785 properties (1,597,380 rooms) at year-end 2023 and 8,675 properties (1,581,002 rooms) at the end of the 2023 third quarter. In the 2024 first three quarters, we added over 77,200 net rooms, including the addition of approximately 37,000 rooms from our exclusive, long-term strategic licensing agreement with MGM Resorts International. 
 At the end of the 2024 third quarter, we had approximately 3,800 hotels and 585,000 rooms in our development pipeline, which includes roughly 34,000 rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. More than 220,000 rooms in the pipeline, or 38 percent, including rooms from our long-term licensing agreement with Sonder Holdings Inc. that we announced in August 2024, were under construction at the end of the 2024 third quarter. Fifty-six percent of the rooms in our development pipeline are located outside U.S. Canada. 
 We currently expect full year 2024 net rooms growth to be around 6.5 percent.

 Cost reimbursements, net (cost reimbursement revenue, net of reimbursed expenses) varies due to timing differences between the costs we incur for centralized programs and services and the related rei mbursemen ts we receive from property owners and franchisees. Over the long term, our centralized programs and services are not designed to impact our economics, either positively or negatively. 
 The decrease in cost reimbursements, net in the 2024 third quarter and 2024 first three quarters primarily reflected lower revenues, net of expenses, for our other programs and services, higher Loyalty Program expenses, and higher expenses related to our insurance program.

 In the 2024 third quarter and 2024 first three quarters, net fee revenue grew in U.S. Canada, EMEA, and APEC, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily reflecting higher RevPAR and unit growth (see the Lodging Statistics and Properties and Rooms tables above for more information), as well as higher profits at managed hotels. In Greater China, net fee revenue decreased in the 2024 third quarter and 2024 first three quarters, primarily due to lower demand. 
 Additionally, U.S. Canada segment profits in the 2024 third quarter and 2024 first three quarters compared to the same periods in 2023 reflected lower cost reimbursement revenue, net of reimbursed expenses 129 million and 159 million, respectively) as well as higher general, administrative, and other expenses, primarily due to higher guarantee reserves 21 million and 26 million, respectively). 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our long-term financial objectives include maintaining diversified financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. At the end of the 2024 third quarter, our long-term debt had a weighted average interest rate of 4.5 percent and a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.4 years. The ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.9 to 1.0 at the end of the 2024 third quarter. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our Credit Facility 
 We are party to a 4.5 billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Facility ). Available borrowings under the Credit Facility support our commercial paper program and general corporate needs. U.S. dollar borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a spread based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 public debt rating. We classify outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and outstanding commercial paper borrowings (which generally have short-term maturities of 45 days or less) as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis. The Credit Facility expires on December 14, 2027. 
 The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4.5 to 1.0. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and liquidity needs. 
 We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to fund our liquidity needs. We believe the Credit Facility, and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our liquidity requirements. 
 Commercial Paper 
 We issue commercial paper in the U.S. Because we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. We do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and access to capital markets. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled 416 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 50 million from year-end 2023, primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities 2,431 million), Senior Notes issuances, net of repayments 2,398 million), and issuances of common stock for our employee stock purchase plan 73 million), partially offset by share repurchases 3,176 million), net commercial paper repayments 648 million), dividends paid 506 million), capital and technology expenditures 408 million), and financing outflows for employee stock-based compensation withholding taxes 127 million). 
 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.4 to 1.0 at the end of the 2024 third quarter. We have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital. 
 Capital Expenditures and Other Investments 
 We made capital and technology expenditures of 408 million in the 2024 first three quarters and 318 million in the 2023 first three quarters. We expect capital expenditures and other investments will total approximately 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion for the 2024 full year, including capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities (including approximately 160 million for maintenance capital spending). Our anticipated capital and technology expenditures include 200 million of spending related to our option to purchase the land underlying the Sheraton Grand Chicago, which we discuss in Note 5. Capital and technology expenditures in 2024 include higher than typical spending on our worldwide technology systems transformation, which is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. 
 
 Share Repurchases and Dividends 
 We repurchased 4.5 million shares of our common stock for 1.0 billion in the 2024 third quarter. Year-to-date through October 31, 2024, we repurchased 14.2 million shares for 3.4 billion. For additional information, see Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 2. 
 
 Our Board of Directors declared the following quarterly cash dividends in 2024 to date: (1) 0.52 per share declared on February 8, 2024 and paid on March 29, 2024 to stockholders of record on February 22, 2024; (2) 0.63 per share declared on May 10, 2024 and paid on June 28, 2024 to stockholders of record on May 24, 2024; and (3)

Table of Contents 

 0.63 per share declared on August 2, 2024 and paid on September 30, 2024 to stockholders of record on August 16, 2024. 
 We expect to continue to return cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 As of the end of the 2024 third quarter, there have been no material changes to our cash requirements as disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. See Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our 2023 Form 10-K for more information about our cash requirements. Also, see Note 6 for information on our long-term debt. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, projected Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax payments under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act totaled 135 million, which is payable within the next 12 months from September 30, 2024. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. We have discussed those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application in our 2023 Form 10-K. We have made no material changes to our critical accounting policies or the methodologies or assumptions that we apply under them. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk has not materially changed since December 31, 2023. See Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on our exposure to market risk. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of those controls and procedures, which by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance about management s control objectives. You should note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that we record, process, summarize, and report the information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to provide reasonable assurance that we accumulate and communicate such information to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions about required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We made no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the 2024 third quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 See the information under the Litigation, Claims, and Government Investigations caption in Note 5, which we incorporate here by reference. Within this section, we use a threshold of 1 million in disclosing material environmental proceedings involving a governmental authority, if any. 
 From time to time, we are also subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including adjustments proposed during governmental examinations of the various tax returns we file. While management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these other proceedings, individually and in aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, cash flows, or overall trends in results of operations, legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and unfavorable rulings could, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We are subject to various risks that make an investment in our securities risky. You should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our 2023 Form 10-K. There are no material changes to the risk factors discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 26 

shall limit Licensor s right to modify the Licensed Marks in accordance with Section 13.2.(B)(3). Otherwise, such usage shall be in strict accordance with the Brand Standards related to the Licensed Marks, which shall be subject to modification in Licensor s sole discretion. Licensor shall make available to Licensee the Brand Standards related to the Licensed Marks as well as any modifications thereto. Licensee shall have a reasonable period of time determined by Licensor to implement any modifications made by Licensor to the Brand Standards related to the Licensed Marks, such as being permitted to exhaust current supplies of collateral, taking into consideration Licensee s contractual commitments and the applicable Specified Licensed Brand Hotel implementation schedule with respect to such modifications. 
 C. Licensor shall have the right to review (on a periodic basis) Marketing Content and other communications using Licensed Marks and to review significant changes in such programs implemented throughout the Licensed Business and significant changes in templates that are widely-used in the Licensed Business, all of which must be in compliance with the Brand Standards at all times.

 A. Licensor and Licensee recognize that they are each leaders in the Lodging Business and the Destination Club and Whole Ownership Residential Businesses, respectively, and that the Brand Standards should reflect the parties expertise in their respective businesses. 
 B. (i) Licensor expressly reserves the right to modify the Brand Standards to make appropriate changes consistent with changes to Licensor s brand standards for the Upscale Brand Segment, Upper-Upscale Brand Segment and or Luxury Brand Segment of Licensor Lodging Facilities, but only to the extent applicable to the Licensed Business and with appropriate modifications to reflect appropriate differences between hotel service levels and service levels applicable to the Licensed Destination Club Business and the Licensed Whole Ownership Residential Business. Licensor shall provide notice to Licensee of any such modifications proposed by Licensor. 
 (ii) Prior to any such modifications to the Brand Standards taking effect, such modifications shall be subject to Licensee s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld provided, however, that Licensee shall have no right to consent to modifications (1) in fire and life safety components of the Brand Standards (although Licensee may request that Licensor s life safety committee consider such exceptions as Licensee may propose) (2) to Brand Standards related to food safety, and global safety and security (3) in the Electronic Systems Standards, subject, however, to Section 10.1.B (provided that such modifications do not conflict with Data Protection Laws that apply to the Licensed Business, and if such conflicts would result from the modification, the parties will seek to resolve such conflict, and Licensee will comply with a standard that does not conflict with Licensee s obligations under Data Protections Laws that most closely addresses the requirements of the modified 
 27

Licensor agrees that if Licensor changes the cross-sell standards or protocol, Licensor will do so only if there is a bona fide commercial basis for such change that is consistent with Licensor s reasonable business judgment as set forth in Section 21.1 and is not motivated by a desire to reallocate or shift business away from Licensee, even though such effect might result from such change. For the avoidance of doubt, if Licensor or its Affiliates acquires or develops a Licensor Lodging Facility brand or changes the segment or brand positioning of an existing Licensor Lodging Facility brand, Licensor may place such new, or existing but repositioned, Licensor Lodging Facility brand in a higher priority in the cross-sell protocol than it is as of the Original Effective Date relative to the positioning of the Projects. 
 (iii) With respect to modifications for which Licensee s prior written consent is not required pursuant to Section 7.2.B(ii), such modifications shall take effect within a reasonable period of time after Licensee s receipt of Licensor s notice pursuant to section 7.2.B(i), taking into account applicable factors and circumstances, such as the importance of the modifications to safety and security, whether such modifications are required or restricted by Applicable Law, the need to obtain approval and or funding from Property Owners Associations, the sequencing of such modifications into the renovation and refurbishment schedules of existing Projects, and the applicable Specified Licensed Brand Hotel implementation schedule with respect to such modifications.

If the parties cannot agree to a timeline for implementation of the modification within thirty (30) days following receipt of Licensor s notice pursuant to Section 7.2.B(i), then Licensee may object to the proposed modification on that basis. If Licensee does not consent or object to such proposed modifications to the Brand Standards within thirty (30) days following receipt of Licensor s notice pursuant to Section 7.2.B(i), such proposed modifications shall be deemed consented to by Licensee and will take effect as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. 
 C. Licensee may from time to time propose modifications to the Brand Standards with respect to any aspect of the Licensed Business. Licensee shall provide notice to Licensor of any such modifications proposed by Licensee. Prior to any such modifications to the Brand Standards taking effect, such modifications shall be subject to Licensor s prior written consent, which (i) in the case of modifications to the Brand Standards described in Section 7.2.B(ii)(1) through (6), may be granted or withheld in Licensor s sole discretion and (ii) in the case of modifications to all other Brand Standards, including those that are part of the Operational Brand Standards, the Design Brand Standards, the Brand Style and Communication Standards (except if the proposed change conflicts with the Brand Standards related to the Licensed Marks that Licensor may modify without Licensee s consent in accordance with

Section 7.2.B(ii)(5)), and the Quality Assurance Program (including the Customer Satisfaction System and the Quality Assurance Audit System), shall not be unreasonably withheld. Licensor shall notify Licensee within thirty (30) days of receipt of Licensee s notice pursuant to this Section 7.2.C of Licensor s consent or objection to any such modifications. With respect to modifications for which Licensor has provided its written consent, such modifications shall take effect within a reasonable period of time agreed to by the parties after Licensor has provided its written consent, taking into account applicable factors and circumstances, such as whether such modifications are required or restricted by Applicable Law, the need to obtain approval and or funding from Property Owners Associations and the sequencing of such modifications into the renovation and refurbishment schedules of existing Projects. If the parties cannot agree to a timeline for implementation of the modification within thirty (30) days following receipt of Licensee s notice pursuant to this Section 7.2.C, then Licensor may object to the proposed modification on that basis. If Licensor does not consent or object to such proposed modifications to the Brand Standards within thirty (30) days following receipt of Licensee s notice pursuant to this Section 7.2.C, such proposed modifications shall be deemed consented to by Licensor and will take effect as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. 
 D. Except as provided in Section 7.2.E, in the event of a dispute regarding proposed modifications to any aspect of the Brand Standards with respect to which either party has consent rights under Section 7.2.B or 7.2.C (other than consents that may be granted or withheld in Licensor s sole discretion), either party may refer the matter to an Expert for resolution pursuant to Section 22.5. 
 (i) For modifications regarding physical aspects of the Brand Standards proposed by Licensor, the Expert will determine whether Licensor s proposed modifications are consistent with changes to the applicable lodging brand segment(s) and otherwise applicable to, and appropriate for, the Licensed Business. 
 (ii) For modifications proposed by Licensee, the Expert will determine whether Licensor s objection to Licensee s proposed modifications is reasonable, taking into account Licensor s brand standards for the Upscale Brand Segment, Upper-Upscale Brand Segment and or Luxury Brand Segment, as applicable, of Licensor Lodging Facilities, the applicability of such standards to Licensed Destination Club Projects and Licensed Residential Projects, the appropriate differences between hotel service levels and service levels applicable to the Licensed Destination Club Business and the Licensed Whole Ownership Residential Business, and whether the failure to implement such modifications will or may adversely affect the Upscale Brand Segment and Upper-Upscale Brand Segment of Licensor Lodging Facilities that bear the Marriott, Sheraton or Westin name or the Luxury Brand Segment of Licensor Lodging Facilities that bear the St. Regis or Luxury Collection name. 
 If the Expert determines that any such proposed modifications are appropriate, such modifications shall take effect within a reasonable period of time after the Expert s determination, taking into account applicable factors and circumstances, such as whether such modifications are required or restricted by Applicable Law, the need to obtain approval and or funding from Property Owners Associations, the sequencing of such modifications into the renovation and refurbishment schedules of existing Projects, and the applicable Specified Licensed Brand Hotel implementation schedule with respect to such modifications. If the Expert determines that such proposed modifications are not appropriate, then the Brand Standards will not be modified to reflect such modifications with respect to the Licensed Business. 
 E. In the event that Licensee does not consent to modifications to any service aspect of the Brand Standards proposed by Licensor with respect to which Licensee has consent rights under 
 29 

Section 7.2.B, and customer satisfaction levels at the Projects decrease greater than five (5) percentage points during the twelve (12) month period immediately following the date on which such change was to have been implemented, the parties shall investigate the reason(s) for the decrease. If the failure to implement one or more proposed modifications to any service aspect of the Brand Standards is determined to be a material reason for any such decrease, then Licensee shall promptly implement such modifications, taking into account applicable factors and circumstances, such as whether such modifications are required or restricted by Applicable Law, the need to obtain approval and or funding from Property Owners Associations, the sequencing of such modifications into the renovation and refurbishment schedules of existing Projects, and the applicable Specified Licensed Brand Hotel implementation schedule with respect to such modifications. 
 F. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall limit in any manner Licensor s or its Affiliates ability to modify or change any standards applicable to Licensor s Lodging Business or Whole Ownership Residential Business, or any other business or activity in which Licensor or its Affiliates may engage from time to time, other than the Licensed Destination Club Business or the Licensed Whole Ownership Residential Business.

 A. Licensor shall provide or make available to Licensee for use in the operation of each Specified Fractional Project those programs and services that it provides or makes available on a centralized basis to substantially all of the Licensor Lodging Facilities operating under the same brand or to a category thereof in which the relevant Specified Fractional Project would be included if it was a Licensor Lodging Facility in the same region (the Centralized Services ).

Licensor may (i) change the structure, scope, delivery and terms of any Centralized Service, (ii) add a new, or discontinue all or part of an existing, Centralized Service or (iii) make a mandatory Centralized Service optional, or an optional Centralized Service mandatory, in each case as Licensor deems advisable from time to time provided that such changes are applicable to the Licensor Lodging Facilities operating under the same brand. 
 B. Unless Licensor agrees in writing to an exception with respect thereto (including due to differences between the Specified Fractional Projects and the Licensor Lodging Facilities operating under the same brand), each Specified Fractional Project shall participate in all Centralized Services that Licensor designates as mandatory and may participate in any of the Centralized Services made available to Licensee that Licensor designates as optional provided that, in each case, the relevant Specified Fractional Project is treated in a manner consistent with the manner in which the Licensor Lodging Facilities operating under the same brand are treated, or a category thereof in which the affected Specified Fractional Project would be included if it was a Licensor Lodging Facility. The Centralized Services may not benefit all participants proportionately. Licensee shall comply with all Brand Standards applicable to the Centralized Services in which a Specified Fractional Project participates, including executing any related documents.

The Centralized Services Charges may include amounts reasonably calculated to cover Licensor s or its Affiliates overheads and other costs incurred in providing (or arranging for the provision of) the Centralized Services, including costs of personnel and equipment and developing, promoting, operating, maintaining and upgrading the Centralized Services and associated Electronic Systems. The Centralized Services Charges also may include fees and costs from third-party providers of Centralized Services, or if Licensor or its Affiliates pay such fees or costs directly, Licensee shall reimburse such amounts. Licensor may increase or decrease any Centralized Services Charges from time to time provided that such changes are applicable to substantially all of the Licensor Lodging Facilities operating under the same brand or to a category thereof in which the Specified Fractional Project would be included if it was a Licensor Lodging Facility, subject to any appropriate modifications agreed to in writing by Licensor to reflect appropriate differences between the applicable Licensor Lodging Facilities and such Specified Fractional Project. The Centralized Services Charges might not benefit all participants proportionately and Licensor and its Affiliates shall determine in their sole discretion how and when the Centralized Services Charges, including but not limited to funds collected for sales and marketing, are spent and allocated on behalf of a region, locality or subset of participants. The Centralized Services do not create any trust and Licensor and its Affiliates do not act as trustee or in any other fiduciary capacity with respect to the Centralized Services Charges.

In any given year the amount of Centralized Services Charges collected might differ from the cost of delivering Centralized Services and Licensor may use any surplus to fund the deficit from a previous year or the delivery of Centralized Services in a future year. Any such surplus, and any interest earned on the Centralized Services Charges retained by Licensor, shall not be deemed a profit. Licensor and its Affiliates may accept marketing or promotional funds from manufacturers and suppliers of goods or services made available through a Centralized Service. Such funds shall be used for programs intended to benefit the brands covered by the Licensed Marks and or other Licensor brands and in accordance with any manufacturer or supplier requirements. 
 E. The Centralized Services Charges for optional Centralized Services may include a mark-up that results in a profit for Licensor or its Affiliates. Licensor and its Affiliates may use the systems, resources and assets related to the Centralized Services to deliver products, services and programs to third parties for a profit by way of a trademark license fee, price mark up, administrative fee, commission, sale-leaseback arrangement, contribution for marketing or promotions and other forms of compensation.

 B. With respect to Existing Projects at which Licensee has not engaged in transient rental and for which Licensee has not notified Licensor prior to the Effective Date of Licensee s intention to engage in transient rentals (each of which is identified in Exhibit H ), prior to engaging in any transient rental activity, Licensee shall give notice of Licensee s intent to engage in transient rental activity to Licensor. If Licensor determines that any transient rental activity would violate any then-existing Permitted Territorial Restriction, then Licensor shall so notify Licensee, and Licensee shall not be permitted to engage in such transient rental activity to the extent such transient rental activity would violate such Permitted Territorial Restriction and for so long as such Permitted Territorial Restriction remains in effect. 
 C. With respect to New Projects, Licensor will evaluate the territorial or other contractual or legal restrictions applicable to Licensor or its Affiliates in connection with the New Project Application process described in Section 5.2. If Licensor determines that any transient rental activity at a New Project would violate any then-existing Permitted Territorial Restriction, then Licensor shall so notify Licensee, and Licensee shall not be permitted to engage in such transient rental activity to the 
 37 

extent such transient rental activity would violate such Permitted Territorial Restriction and for so long as such Permitted Territorial Restriction remains in effect. 
 9.3 No Affiliation with Other Brands Businesses. 
 A. Licensee shall not affiliate with or use the Licensor Intellectual Property in conjunction, or association, with any brand, trademark, product, service, or business other than the Licensed Business which is the subject of this Agreement, or use the Licensor Intellectual Property in a way that could reasonably be interpreted as endorsing, or suggesting affiliation with, any other brand, mark, product, service or business, other than marketing alliances and exchange affiliations that are consistent with the practice of Licensee and its Affiliates during the period from January 1, 2005 until the Original Effective Date, as reasonably demonstrated by Licensee, and other marketing alliances, exchange affiliations and similar arrangements permitted under Section 9.5. 
 B. (i) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent Licensee or its Affiliates from creating, developing, operating, licensing, or managing its own brand or system for (1) Destination Club Projects or Destination Club Products or (2) a Lodging Business provided, however, that as set forth in this Agreement, Licensee shall not use Licensor Confidential Information, the Branded Elements, or the Licensed Business Customer Information in connection with any business other than the Licensed Business, and nothing in this Agreement will require Licensor to license or franchise any lodging project to Licensee if Licensee creates, develops, operates, licenses, or manages a brand or system for a Lodging Business (a Licensee Competitive Lodging Brand ), unless Licensor and Licensee have agreed on a separation plan pursuant to which Licensee agrees to restrictions to ensure appropriate separation of the Licensee Competitive Lodging Brand from Licensee s Lodging Business related to Licensor Lodging Facilities (the Separation Plan ). Licensor and Licensee have agreed on a Separation Plan with respect to a Licensee Competitive Lodging Brand as of the Effective Date. 
 (ii) A Separation Plan for an additional Licensee Competitive Lodging Brand would be substantially similar to the existing Separation Plan. The goal of a Separation Plan is to prevent Licensee from using, sharing or discussing confidential information, pricing and other sensitive information with or for the benefit of the Licensee Competitive Lodging Brand and to maintain the confidentiality of such information, whether this is accomplished by physical separation or by Licensor not providing such information. For purposes of clarification, the foregoing is not intended to affect access by Licensee and its Affiliates to information with respect to the Licensed Business pursuant to this Agreement. 
 C. Licensee shall not establish or operate a Sales Facility at any hotel or resort owned, operated, or franchised by a Lodging Competitor without Licensor s prior written consent.

Licensee s failure to comply with subsections 9.4(i) through (iii) shall be a default under this Agreement and will result in Licensee failing to have met the conditions precedent to converting the Project to another brand. 
 9.5 Services and Products Made Available to Members and Marketing and Exchange Arrangements. 
 A. Licensee may only enter into marketing arrangements with respect to the Licensed Business with third parties, and may only make available to Members those products and services (including Exchange Programs), (i) that are consistent with the brand positioning of the Licensed Business and, with respect to such marketing arrangements, are in compliance with the Brand Standards or (ii) that were in place as of the Original Effective Date or that are consistent with Licensee s practice during the period from January 1, 2005 until the Original Effective Date, as reasonably demonstrated by Licensee.

Licensor will notify Licensee of such objection, and the parties will engage in discussions and attempt to agree on modifications to such practice(s) so that such practice(s) will be in compliance with the Brand Standards. For local marketing alliances, the positioning of the Project in the local market shall be the governing standard. 
 B. Licensee shall have the right to seek prior written confirmation from Licensor on a confidential basis that any proposed program or arrangement is consistent with applicable Brand Standards and will not result in a breach of Licensee s obligations under this Agreement.

 39 

determines that such New Licensee Program is not consistent with the Brand Standards, then Licensor may refer the matter for Expert resolution pursuant to Section 22.5. In either case, if the Expert finds in favor of Licensor, then Licensor s prior written consent shall be required for each New Licensee Program that is implemented on a system-wide or region-wide (e.g., throughout the United States of America, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, Asia Pacific or a substantial portion thereof) basis for the twenty-four (24) month period following any such determination. 
 C. Licensee shall not allow its Members of any Project to exchange their right to use and occupy Licensed Destination Club Units or Licensed Unbranded Destination Club Units for stays (or other benefits) at luxury or upscale hotels other than those operated or franchised by Licensor or its Affiliates, except through general Exchange Programs or through tour operator arrangements that are in compliance with Licensor s Brand Standards related to approved distribution channels provided that Licensee shall be permitted to include hotels that are neither Licensor Lodging Facilities nor a part of a Lodging Competitor s hotel system in its Explorer, Club Connections, or similar program in locations where a Licensor Lodging Facility of the same brand segment and of a suitable experience type (e.g., resort) is not available. Licensor will not object to the Exchange Program and tour operator arrangements that Licensee has in place as of the Effective Date as not being in compliance with Brand Standards, and Licensee may continue such arrangements after the Effective Date with respect to the Projects covered thereby provided, however, that Licensee shall not enter into any new or additional such arrangements that do not meet the Brand Standards, and Licensor does not waive any claims related to misuses of the Licensed Marks. Licensee and its Affiliates shall have the right to operate their own Exchange Programs. Licensee may use the Licensed Marks as part of a branded Exchange Program name approved in writing by Licensor.

At Licensor s request, use of the Licensed Marks as part of a branded Exchange Program name shall be discontinued if (i) at any time the aggregate number of Licensed Destination Club Units that participate in such branded Exchange Program is less than one-half (1 2) of the total number of all Destination Club Units that participate in such branded Exchange Program or (ii) Licensee permits Destination Club Units operated under any Hilton Brand to participate in such Exchange Program, provided that if clause (ii) is implicated, Licensee shall, in no event, be required to discontinue such use until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date.

 F. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent Licensee s Affiliate, Interval International, LLC, or any of its Affiliates, from continuing to use the Licensed Marks to the extent necessary to designate individual properties made available to participants in Exchange Programs administered by such Affiliate. 
 40 

9.6 Changes in Programs, Services or Benefits. 
 Prior to making any significant systemic changes in the Licensed Destination Club Business or the Licensed Whole Ownership Residential Business (for example, conversion to a points program), Licensee shall have the right to seek prior written confirmation from Licensor, on a confidential basis, that any such change is consistent with the Brand Standards and will not result in a breach of Licensee s obligations under this Agreement. In the event of a dispute regarding whether any such change is inconsistent with the Brand Standards or would result in a breach (whether or not Licensee sought prior confirmation that the proposed change is consistent with the Brand Standards), the dispute will be referred for Expert resolution pursuant to Section 22.5. 
 10. ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 
 10.1 Systems Installation. 
 A. Licensee will, as a cost of the Licensed Business, arrange for the purchase or lease, installation, maintenance, and use at the Projects of all Electronic Systems that Licensor reasonably requires or that Licensee chooses to use in connection with the Licensed Business, in accordance with the Brand Standards and specifications provided by or on behalf of Licensor and may not use such Electronic Systems for anything not specifically related to the Projects and the Licensed Business.

 A. Licensor will make the Reservation System available to Licensee in connection with the Licensed Business, including for reservations relating to Member usage, marketing usage, transient rental usage, and other usages of Licensed Destination Club Units, Licensed Unbranded Destination Club Units and Licensed Residential Units. All Licensed Destination Club Units, Licensed Unbranded Destination Club Units (other than Licensed Unbranded Destination Club Units at the Harborside Resort at Atlantis, which are not currently listed in the Reservation System but will be added to the Reservation System if the parties find a reasonably practicable technology solution for facilitating such listing) and Licensed Residential Units inventory made available by Licensee for transient rental stays of thirty (30) days or less must be listed in the Reservation System, but such inventory shall not be included in Lodging Competitors distribution channels, provided that for the purposes hereof, any distribution channels included within Licensor s channel standards or otherwise approved by Licensor shall not be deemed Lodging Competitors distribution channels. Licensee will comply with all Brand Standards applicable to the Licensed Business related to participation in the Reservation System, including the prohibitions on the inclusion of transient rental inventory other than inventory in Licensor Lodging Facilities or in Projects in elements of the Reservation System visible by customers, travel agents, and other members of the public. For purposes of the foregoing, Licensor and Licensee acknowledge that the seasonal nature of the Licensed Destination Club Business and Member use patterns (including increased Member use in high demand seasons) and leisure-based use patterns (including higher weekend occupancy and lower weekday occupancy) create transient rental inventory availability patterns that may differ from those for Licensor Lodging Facilities. As such, certain Brand Standards relating to participation in the Reservation System may not be suitable for the Licensed Destination Club 
 41 

Business (such as minimum room availability requirements for Brand Loyalty Program redemptions or the 50 Off Associate Rate winter offer). 
 B. If Licensee is in material breach of this Agreement and does not cure the breach as required by Licensor s notice of breach, Licensor may, in addition to any other remedies it may have and in accordance with Section 18.4, suspend Licensee s right to use the Reservation System at one (1) or more of the Projects (or a part of any Project) with respect to transient rentals of Licensed Destination Club Units, Licensed Unbranded Destination Club Units and or Licensed Residential Units until the breach is cured. In the event such breach relates to one (1) or more Projects, Licensor may exercise its right to suspend Licensee from the Reservation System under this Section 10.2.B with respect to the applicable Project(s). In the event such breach relates to the Licensed Business apart from specific individual Projects or to all or substantially all of the Projects, Licensor may suspend the entire Licensed Business and all of the Projects from the Reservation System under this Section 10.2.B. Licensee covenants not to bring any damages claims against Licensor and its Affiliates arising from Licensee s suspension from the Reservation System under Section 18.4, other than claims that Licensee is not in breach of this Agreement. 
 C. Licensee will have the right to make proposals regarding the Reservation System to Licensor s Reservation Users Group. The parties will agree on a reasonable process for keeping Licensee apprised of initiatives of Licensor s Reservation Users Group that will affect the Licensed Business. 
 10.3 Electronic Systems Provided Under License. 
 A. The Electronic Systems not purchased by Licensee will remain the sole property of Licensor or any third party vendors, as applicable.

 C. Licensee will have the right to make proposals regarding the Electronic Systems to the appropriate group within Licensor s organization that is responsible for strategic initiatives related to Electronic Systems. The parties will agree on a reasonable process for keeping Licensee apprised of initiatives regarding the Electronic Systems that will affect the Licensed Business. 
 10.4 Proposed Enhancements. 
 Licensor will reasonably consider changes to the Electronic Systems proposed by Licensee which address issues specifically relevant to the Licensed Business (including any enhancements to the Electronic Systems needed to implement such changes). Licensor shall respond to such requests within one hundred twenty (120) days following Licensor s receipt of the written request. Licensor may condition its consent to changes to the Electronic Systems suggested by Licensee based on factors such as Licensee s payment of the costs related to such implementation, including incremental internal or out-of-pocket design costs and operating costs (and the allocation thereof on a fair and commercially reasonable basis to other users of the applicable Electronic Systems who benefit from the change) the difficulties of designing or administering such changes the impact of such changes on the Electronic 
 42 

Systems generally third party consent requirements the prioritization of other Electronic Systems projects the general feasibility of implementing and maintaining such changes over time and considerations relating to owners and franchisees associated with Licensor Lodging Facilities.

The parties acknowledge and agree that future changes in and or replacements of Licensor and its Affiliates and or Licensee s and its Affiliates technologies, systems, business processes, programs and or business partners over the Term of this Agreement Business Changes ), including changes required by Applicable Law or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could make it more difficult, costly, commercially impractical, or even impossible to continue to provide one or more services provided by Licensor or its Affiliates or Licensee or its Affiliates hereunder (the Affected Services ), or could otherwise necessitate changes to the Affected Services. In the event of such a Business Change, Licensee and Licensor agree to discuss, in good faith, making commercially reasonable changes to the Affected Services, including changes to the manner, method, scope, delivery, timing and cost of the Affected Services, or substitution of a similar service that accomplishes the principal underlying purpose or function of the Affected Service, in order to permit the Affected Services to continue on a commercially reasonable basis (such changes, Service Modifications ). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event Licensor contemplates modifying or replacing any of the Key Applications (as defined in the Services Manual) (or successor applications thereto), Licensor will give Licensee commercially reasonable advance notice thereof, allow Licensee to identify its requirements with respect thereto, and work with Licensee to ensure that the planning, architecture, design and development activities for such modification or replacement are undertaken with adequate consideration given to Licensee s requirements, and that Licensee is afforded ongoing access to the capabilities (or substantially similar replacement capabilities) provided by such applications to the extent such capabilities are feasible and can be reasonably accommodated by such modified or replacement application. The parties understand and agree that the party receiving an Affected Service shall bear the reasonable incremental expense of any Service Modification, including any increased costs required for the providing party to continue to provide the Affected Service as so modified. The determination of amounts charged to Licensee will be consistent with the manner in which such charges are made with respect to participating Licensor Lodging Facilities, taking into account the manner and extent to which such systems are used in connection with the Licensed Business, as further described in Section 3.3. If the parties cannot agree upon commercially reasonable Service Modifications, taking into consideration any offer made by the party receiving such service to pay the incremental costs of any Service Modification, then the provider of the Affected Service shall no longer be obligated to provide the Affected Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Licensor or its Affiliates generally discontinue any Affected Service that Licensor or its Affiliates had previously offered or provided in connection with Licensor s and its Affiliates Lodging Business, to Licensor Lodging Facility franchisees or to other third parties, Licensor and its Affiliates shall no longer be required to provide that Affected Service to Licensee or its Affiliates, and in such case Licensor or its Affiliates shall, at Licensee s request, cooperate with Licensee and its 
 44 

Affiliates to transition any such Affected Service to another service provider or to Licensee or its Affiliates, such transition costs to be at Licensee s expense.

Licensee or its Affiliates must fund the cost of all repairs and alterations at the Projects (or, as applicable, request that Property Owners Associations fund such costs). Any significant alterations, renewals, replacements, or additions to any Project, including those that affect the design, character, appearance or fire and life safety elements of any Project, will be carried out in accordance with the process set forth in the Design Review Addendum. However, repairs and maintenance that are conducted in the ordinary course of business shall not be subject to process set forth in the Design Review Addendum.

In connection with replacements in the immediately preceding sentence, the replacement of all Soft Goods or all Case Goods, as the case may be, will be done at the same time for each phase of a Project rather than being done in a piecemeal fashion.

 45 

Non-Controlled Property Owners Associations) to upgrade the rest of the particular phase of the Project to conform to the building d cor, trade dress, and FF&E required under then-current Brand Standards for Projects of similar age.

 C. Licensor represents with respect to the Licensed Marks that 
 (1) Licensor or its Affiliates own the trademark registrations and applications for (or have the right to use and sublicense) the Licensed Marks for the Licensed Services in the jurisdictions all as identified on the list described in Section 13.1.A. 
 (2) Licensor has the right to grant the license contemplated hereunder, subject to the following (a) neither Licensor nor its Affiliates own trademark registrations or applications for the Licensed Marks for some or all of the Licensed Services in every country or jurisdiction of the Territory and some countries or jurisdictions do not permit registration of service marks

 (3) To the best of Licensor s actual knowledge, there are no agreements, claims, litigation, or proceedings completed, pending or threatened in writing, that might affect its right to grant the license.

 (2) (i) If Licensee has a commercially reasonable expectation that it will render Licensed Services under the Licensed Marks in any particular Unregistered Area or in a jurisdiction of which Licensor has notified Licensee may have Vulnerable Registrations under Section 13.1.C(2) Subject Jurisdictions ), Licensee will provide notice to Licensor of the Subject Jurisdiction(s) at least ninety (90) days prior to rendering any Licensed Services under the Licensed Marks or entering into any sublicense agreement under Sections 5.1.C, 5.2.D, or 5.8.B, in any Subject Jurisdiction. Upon receipt of such notice(s), Licensor or its Affiliate will file and prosecute new trademark application(s), or continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to prosecute any then-pending trademark applications, at Licensor s expense, subject to any prior or superior third-party rights in that country or jurisdiction and the laws and regulations of that country or jurisdiction.

Licensor agrees to consult with Licensee upon learning of third-party rights that may conflict with Licensor s ability to obtain a registration in the Subject Jurisdiction provided, however, that such consultation shall not, and is not intended to, modify the provision above that Licensor has no obligation to file or obtain such trademarks and that Licensor may make such determination in its sole and final discretion. Licensee shall have no claim against Licensor or its Affiliates with respect to, and neither Licensor nor its Affiliates shall be liable for, any failure by Licensor or its Affiliates to obtain registration of the Licensed Marks in any Unregistered Area or to obtain any protection of the Licensed Marks in jurisdictions with Vulnerable Registrations. Licensee shall have no right to use, sublicense, or otherwise permit or consent to the use of, any of the Licensed Marks for any purpose in any Unregistered Areas or any jurisdictions of which Licensor has notified Licensee may have Vulnerable Registrations until 
 47 

Licensor has notified Licensee in writing that Licensee is authorized to use the Licensed Marks in such jurisdiction(s).

Until such time that Licensor has authorized Licensee s or its Affiliate s use of the Licensed Marks in the Subject Jurisdiction, if Licensee or its Affiliate elects to proceed with the use of the Licensed Marks prior to receiving such notice, (x) such use shall be at Licensee s or its Affiliates sole risk and Licensee shall indemnify Licensor as if such use were an unauthorized use pursuant to Section 16.1.A(i), and (y) notwithstanding anything in Section 16.1.B to the contrary, Licensor will have no obligation to indemnify Licensee or its Affiliates for such use. If Licensor determines, and notifies Licensee, that a Licensed Mark in a Subject Jurisdiction cannot be registered or cannot be used due to prior or superior third party rights, Licensee and its Affiliates shall cease any use that it commenced with respect to the applicable Licensed Mark under this Section 13.1.D(2)(ii) promptly following receipt of such notice.

Additionally, if any Affiliate of Licensee that is using a Permitted Licensee Affiliate Name affiliates with a Lodging Competitor Brand, Licensor may terminate the right to use the Permitted Licensee Affiliate Name as to that Affiliate, in which event, the use of the Permitted Licensee Affiliate Name of such Affiliate shall be immediately discontinued and such corporate name shall be promptly changed to a name that does not use the word Marriott or any of Licensor s or its Affiliates other trademarks or trade names or any similar trademarks or trade names. 
 (iv) In the event that it is impossible for any Permitted Licensee Affiliate Name to be changed to a corporate name that does not use of the word Marriott or any of Licensor s or its Affiliates other trademarks or trade names or any similar trademarks or trade names pursuant to (iii) above, the license to use the Permitted Licensee Affiliate Name will remain in place for so long during the Term as it remains impossible to change the name provided, however, the parties will discuss and agree on a solution whereby there are no further consumer-facing uses of the Permitted Licensee Affiliate Name, which may include the adoption of a doing business as (DBA) name that does not use the word Marriott or any of Licensor s or its Affiliates other trademarks or trade names or any similar trademarks or trade names. 
 (v) Licensee shall not, at any time, include any brand name in its corporate name (other than the name Marriott in the Permitted Corporate Name and Marriott , Sheraton , Westin and St. Regis in the Permitted Licensee Affiliate Names), other than a new brand name developed by Licensee that does not contain any of the Licensor Intellectual Property or any similar marks or names, provided, that Licensee and its Affiliates may at any time use the words Vacation , Vacations , Worldwide , and or Corporation in an entity name that does not contain any of the Licensor Intellectual Property or any similar marks or names.

 (4) Notwithstanding Section 13.2.A(3) or any fair use rights that Licensee or its Affiliates may have with respect to the Permitted Corporate Name or the Permitted Licensee Affiliate Names, Licensee and its Affiliates are expressly prohibited from using, and Licensee hereby agrees not to use and agrees to cause its Affiliates not to use, the Permitted Corporate Name or the Permitted Licensee Affiliate Names (or any variation thereof) as part of, or in any way associated with, the name of any property that is not part of the Licensed Business without Licensor s prior written consent in its sole discretion. For illustrative purposes only, Licensee and its Affiliates would be prohibited from using the following name Napa Valley Destination Club operated by Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation . However, if a jurisdiction recognizes nominative fair use rights and a Member makes nominative fair use of a Licensed Mark in connection with a sale of its interests in a Project in such jurisdiction, then this section is not intended to limit or modify such fair use rights. If Licensee or its Affiliates use the Permitted Corporate Name, the Permitted Licensee Affiliate Names, or any variation thereof in violation of this Section 13.2.A(4), then, in addition to any damages that Licensor or its Affiliates may be entitled to hereunder or under Applicable Law, Licensor will have the right to require Licensee or its Affiliates, as applicable, to pay Royalties for each property with respect to which Licensee or its Affiliates are using the Permitted Corporate Name, the Permitted Licensee Affiliate Names, or a variation thereof, in violation of this Section 13.2.A(4).

If Licensee requests that Licensor file an application for a new trademark that includes any Proprietary Mark which is related to a new program or initiative under the Licensed Business and Licensor approves such request (such approval to be granted if the request is commercially reasonable), Licensor will file such application at Licensor s expense. If Licensee wishes to modify an existing Licensed Mark and requests that Licensor file an application for such modified Licensed Mark, and Licensor approves such request to modify, Licensor will file such application, but Licensee must reimburse Licensor for all costs and expenses related to such application (including the costs for conducting a trademark search, filing and prosecuting an application through to registration, maintenance of any resulting registrations (unless such resulting registration replaces an existing registration that is not maintained), and any related appeals, proceedings, disputes, oppositions and litigation). 
 (8) If Licensee or any of its Affiliates registers or has registered or directly or indirectly controls any domain name, social media name or handle that is determined by Licensor to be similar to a domain name, social media name or handle owned by Licensor or its Affiliates as described in Section 13.2.B(1) below or that incorporate any of the Proprietary Marks (or any variation thereof), 
 50 

Licensee or its Affiliates, as applicable, must unconditionally assign such domain name, social media name or handle to Licensor or its Affiliate.

Licensor shall have sole responsibility for enforcing the Licensor Intellectual Property at its sole discretion and cost and is entitled to all settlements, damages, costs, attorneys fees or other amounts received from such enforcement efforts. If any such settlement amount or damage award received by Licensor is solely based on damage to or impact on the exclusively licensed aspects of the Licensed Business, then after applying such amount or award toward Licensor s attorneys fees and other costs related to the matter, Licensor will share any remaining portion of the settlement amount or damage award with Licensee in an equitable manner as determined by Licensor based on the relative interests of the parties. 
 B. Licensee agrees that 
 (1) Licensor and or its Affiliates are the owners or licensees of all right, title, and interest in and to the System (other than Electronic Systems provided by or licensed by third parties), the goodwill associated with and symbolized by the Proprietary Marks, and the domain names www.marriottvacationclub.com , www.marriottvacationsworldwide.com , www.grandresidenceclub.com , and www.marriott.com , and other domain names owned by Licensor or its Affiliates

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee will not 
 51 

be required to discontinue using or change any Licensed Mark that is used solely in connection with the Licensed Business and is not the same as or similar to any mark owned by Licensor or its Affiliates for use in connection with Licensor Lodging Facilities or other businesses and activities of Licensor and its Affiliates and 
 (b) Licensor may require that Licensee bear the costs related to such replacement, addition, deletion, or other modification in respect of the Licensed Business provided, however, that Licensor shall treat Licensee in the same way that Licensor treats franchisees or licensees of Licensor Lodging Facilities with respect to such costs, or the economic equivalent thereof.

 (5) Licensee has no Ownership Interest in the System or the Licensor Intellectual Property (including any modifications, derivatives or additions thereto proposed by or on behalf of Licensee or its Affiliates (for purposes hereof, collectively, modifications )), and Licensee s use of the System and the Licensor Intellectual Property in connection with the operation of the Licensed Business and the Projects will not give Licensee any Ownership Interest therein. Licensee hereby assigns (and will cause each of its employees or independent contractors who contributed to such modifications to assign) to Licensor, in perpetuity throughout the world, all rights, title and interest (including the entire copyright and all renewals, reversions and extensions thereof) in and to all modifications to the Licensor Intellectual Property and other aspects of the System proposed or created by or on behalf of Licensee or its Affiliates. Licensee waives (and will cause each of its employees or independent contractors who contributed to such modifications to waive) all rights of droit moral or moral rights of authors or any similar rights that Licensee (or its employees or independent contractors) may now or hereafter have in such modifications, and Licensee disclaims any interest in such modifications by virtue of a constructive trust.

16.4 Obligation to Maintain Insurance. 
 Licensee s obligation to maintain the insurance hereunder will not relieve Licensee of its obligations under Sections 16.1. As required by Licensor on similar projects, Licensor reserves the right to review the insurance coverages and limits from time to time and require increases or amendments to the insurance outlined in 16.2 and 16.3 based on competitive terms and conditions in the jurisdiction where the applicable Project is located. Such requirements shall be mutually agreed by Licensor and Licensee, but in no event shall the changes be less than those required by Licensor on similar projects.

 16.5 Contribution. 
 A.

The amount contributed by the indemnifying party will be in such proportion as reflects the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnitee in connection with the actions or omissions resulting in the liability and any other relevant equitable considerations. 
 B. The parties agree that any method of allocation of contribution under this Section 16.5 will take into account the equitable considerations referred to in Section 16.5.A.

No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act of 1933) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 
 17. TRANSFERABILITY OF INTERESTS 
 17.1 Transfers by Licensee. 
 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Licensee may not assign this Agreement or assign or sublicense any of its rights hereunder, or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement, or sell, transfer or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets relating to the Licensed Business, or merge or consolidate with any other entity in which Licensee is not the surviving entity, or engage in a transaction or series of related transactions that result in a Change in Control without Licensor s prior written consent which it may grant or withhold in its sole discretion. Any such Transfer will be a material default under this Agreement, and Licensor shall be entitled to enjoin or obtain a court order prohibiting such Transfer without posting a bond. Licensee shall not make any Transfer to a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person provided, however, that so long as the Ownership Interests in Licensee are publicly-traded on a U.S., nationally-recognized securities exchange, the purchase of publicly-traded Ownership Interests in Licensee by a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person shall not be deemed to be a violation of this sentence. If a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person acquires a Controlling Interest in Licensee, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to Licensee. 
 67 

17.2 Transfers by Licensor. 
 A. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Licensor may not assign this Agreement or assign any of its rights hereunder, or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement provided, however, that Licensor may Transfer this Agreement to any Person without prior notice to, or consent of, Licensee, provided such Person (a) assumes Licensor s obligations to Licensee under this Agreement and (b) (i) is an Affiliate of Licensor that has the legal, financial, and operational ability to perform the obligations of Licensor under this Agreement or (ii) acquires all or substantially all of Licensor s rights in respect of (a) the System, (b) Specified Licensed Brand Hotels, and (c) the Branded Elements. This Agreement will be binding on and inure to the benefit of Licensor and the successors and assigns of Licensor. If, in connection with such acquisition of the rights in respect of the System and the Transfer of this Agreement Licensor retains ownership or control of any of the underlying assets of the System necessary to perform Licensor s obligations under this Agreement, Licensor will continue to provide to Licensee, or to the Person assuming this Agreement, access to such underlying assets as is necessary to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If, in connection with such acquisition of the rights in respect of the System and the Transfer of this Agreement, the components of the Branded Elements that are used in Specified Licensed Brand Hotels are replaced with different or modified components by the Person assuming this Agreement, then, as a condition of such acquisition, such Person will be required to provide Licensee with access to such different or modified components that are comparable to the corresponding components of the Branded Elements. Licensor shall not make any Transfer to a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person provided, however, that so long as the Ownership Interests in Licensor are publicly-traded on a U.S., nationally-recognized securities exchange, the purchase of publicly-traded Ownership Interests in Licensor by a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person shall not be deemed to be a violation of this sentence. If a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person acquires a Controlling Interest in Licensor, Licensee shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to Licensor. 
 B. Licensee acknowledges that Licensor and its Affiliates operate as a multi-national business enterprise. Without limiting Section 17.2.A, Licensor has the right to Transfer all or part of its rights under this Agreement to any of Licensor s Affiliates and, in connection therewith, require Licensee to pay amounts due under this Agreement to such Affiliates. However, if, as a result of any such Transfer, Licensee will be liable for greater Tax liability for payments due hereunder following such Transfer, any resulting increase in Tax liability shall be borne by Licensor and not by Licensee. 
 17.3 Proposed Transfers to Lodging Competitors. 
 Without limiting Section 17.1, no Transfer of any Ownership Interest in Licensee, any Projects, the Licensed Business or any Transaction Agreement will be made to a Lodging Competitor that results in a Lodging Competitor obtaining Control of Licensee, the Projects, or the Licensed Business. Any such Transfer will be a material default under this Agreement, and Licensor shall be entitled to enjoin or obtain a court order prohibiting such Transfer without posting a bond. 
 17.4 Comfort Letter and Security Interests in This Agreement. 
 In connection with any financing benefiting the Licensed Business, Licensee may not assign, mortgage, or grant a security interest in, or pledge as collateral, this Agreement, except as permitted hereunder. At Licensee s request, Licensor hereby agrees to provide to Licensee s lender a comfort letter that is substantially similar to the form of comfort letter that has been agreed to by the parties as of the Original Effective Date, so long as such lender is not an Affiliate of Licensee and 
 68 

Licensee is not in breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement. However, Licensor has no obligation to provide a comfort letter in connection with, or consent to, a transaction that would be prohibited by this Section 17. If a lender forecloses on, or otherwise exercises its rights against the assets of the Licensed Business, the revenues of the Licensed Business, or such Ownership Interests in Licensee, or Licensee violates this Section 17, Licensor will have the rights under Section 18.1. Licensor has no obligation to license a lender or any Person acting on behalf of a lender, including a receiver or servicer of a loan, to use the Licensed Marks or the System, unless that obligation arises from a valid and binding written agreement between Licensor and a lender.

 (ix) (a) If Licensee or any of its Affiliates is convicted of a felony or other similar crime or offense or engages in a pattern or practice of acts or conduct that, as a result of the adverse publicity that has occurred in connection with such offense, acts, or conduct, is likely to have or has had a material adverse effect on the System, the Proprietary Marks, the goodwill associated therewith or Licensor s interests therein, then Licensor may issue a notice of breach and exercise any of the remedies under Section 18.2.B 
 (b) If Licensee or any of its Affiliates is convicted of a felony or other similar crime or offense or engages in a pattern or practice of acts or conduct that, as a result of the adverse publicity that has occurred in connection with such offense, acts, or conduct, has or may result in the goodwill associated with the Proprietary Marks and System being so materially damaged that termination of the entire relationship contemplated by this Agreement is the only adequate remedy, then Licensor may issue a notice of breach.

If Licensee fails to enter into a Remediation Arrangement within ninety (90) days following the date of the notice of breach or fails to cure the breach pursuant to the Remediation Arrangement, Licensor may issue a notice of default and terminate this Agreement and all rights granted to Licensee hereunder immediately upon notice to Licensee and or exercise any of the other remedies under Section 18.2.B

If Licensee fails to notify Licensor within fourteen (14) days following the notice of breach that Licensee intends to unwind such Transfer or fails to actually unwind such Transfer in a manner satisfactory to Licensor within ninety (90) days following the notice of breach, then Licensor may issue a notice of default and terminate this Agreement and all rights granted to Licensee hereunder immediately upon notice to Licensee and or exercise any of the other remedies under Section 18.2.B provided, however, that nothing herein shall restrict or limit Licensor s ability to seek injunctive relief to stop such Transfer at any time

Licensee further acknowledges and agrees that, in the event Licensor terminates this Agreement as a result of a material event of default hereunder by Licensee, it would be commercially impossible for Licensor to take measures to recreate the Licensed Business or develop an equivalent business, and, therefore it would be unreasonable to expect or require Licensor to mitigate its damages resulting from such default and termination

 (b) If an arbitration panel under Section 22.4 determines that (i) a material breach has occurred, (ii) (x) Licensor has failed to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such breach or (y) such breach was intentional or resulted from Licensor s gross negligence, and (iii) such breach has or may result in the goodwill associated with the Licensed Business being so materially damaged as a result of the breach that interim injunctive relief is an inadequate remedy and that termination of the entire relationship contemplated by this Agreement is the only adequate remedy, then upon the rendering of arbitration panel s determination Licensee may issue a notice of default to Licensor and terminate this Agreement and or exercise any of the other remedies under Section 18.3.B.

Licensee agrees that Licensor, in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment, may act with the intention to benefit the System and Licensor s business as a whole, and not individual Licensor Lodging Facilities or other facilities, including the Projects. Licensee will have the burden of establishing that Licensor failed to exercise reasonable business judgment, and neither the fact that Licensor benefited economically from an action nor the existence of other reasonable or commercially reasonable 
 85 

alternatives will, by themselves, imply such a failure. To the extent that any implied covenant, such as the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or civil law duty of good faith is applied to this Agreement, Licensor and Licensee intend that Licensor will not have violated such covenant or duty if Licensor has exercised reasonable business judgment. 
 21.2 Independent Contractor. 
 A. This Agreement does not create a fiduciary relationship between Licensor and Licensee. Licensee and Licensor are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement is intended to constitute either party as an agent, legal representative, subsidiary, joint venturer, partner, manager, employee, or servant of the other for any purpose, except that Licensor may act on Licensee s behalf as Licensee s agent for purposes of booking reservations at any Project. 
 B. Nothing in this Agreement authorizes either party to make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on the other party s behalf or to incur any debt or other obligation in the other party s name.

 22.1 Governing Law Venue. 
 A. This Agreement is executed pursuant to, and will be interpreted and construed under the laws of New York, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions of such jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section 22.1 is intended to invoke the application of any franchise, business opportunity, antitrust, implied covenant, unfair competition, fiduciary or any other doctrine of law of the State of New York or any other state which would not otherwise apply absent this Section 22.1. 
 B. Each party hereby expressly and irrevocably submits itself to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New York for the purpose of resolving any Dispute under Section 22.2. So far as is permitted under the laws of New York, this consent to personal jurisdiction will be self-operative. 
 22.2 Injunctive Relief. 
 A. Licensor will be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy or irreparable harm, without the necessity of posting a bond, and without waiving any other rights or remedies at law or in equity, for any actual or threatened material breach or violation of this Agreement for which such relief is an available remedy, the Brand Standards (including, but not limited to, threats or danger to public health or safety) or actual or threatened misuse or misappropriation of the Licensor Intellectual Property or Licensor Confidential Information. The rights conferred by this Section 22.2.A expressly include Licensor s entitlement to affirmative injunctive, declaratory, and other equitable or judicial relief (including specific performance) for Licensee s failure to operate any portion of the Licensed Business in accordance with the applicable Brand Standards, including affirmative relief that any such deficiencies are cured and thereafter meet the Brand Standards. 
 B. Licensee will be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy or irreparable harm, without the necessity of posting a bond, and without waiving any other rights or remedies at law or in equity, for any actual or threatened material breach or violation of this Agreement

 22.3 Costs of Enforcement. 
 If for any reason it becomes necessary for either party to initiate any legal or equitable action to secure or protect its rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover all costs incurred by it in successfully enforcing such rights, including reasonable lawyers fees. 
 22.4 Arbitration. 
 A. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, any Dispute or any other matter concerning any aspect of the relationship of the parties will be finally settled, by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, except as modified herein (the AAA Rules ), conducted in Washington, DC. 
 B. There will be three (3) arbitrators. If there are only two (2) parties to the arbitration, each of Licensor and Licensee will appoint one (1) arbitrator within twenty (20) days after receipt by respondent of a copy of the demand for arbitration. For purposes of this Section 22.4, Licensor and its Affiliates, on one hand, and Licensee and its Affiliates, on the other hand, will each be deemed to be one (1) party. The two (2) party-appointed arbitrators will have twenty (20) days from the appointment of the second (2nd) arbitrator to agree on a third (3rd) arbitrator who will chair the arbitral tribunal. Any arbitrator not timely appointed by the parties under this Section 22.4.B will be appointed in accordance with AAA Rule R.11, and in any such procedure, each party will be given a limited number of strikes, excluding strikes for cause. 
 C. Any Dispute to be settled by arbitration under this Section 22.4 will at the request of Licensor or Licensee be resolved in a single arbitration before a single tribunal together with any Dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other agreement (including any other Transaction Agreements) between or among Licensee, Guarantor and their respective Affiliates on the one hand and Licensor or its Affiliates on the other. If there are multiple claimants and or multiple respondents to the effect that there are more than two (2) parties to the arbitration, all claimants and or all respondents will attempt to agree upon their respective appointments. If such multiple parties fail to nominate an arbitrator within thirty (30) days, the AAA will appoint an arbitrator on their behalf. In such circumstances, any existing nomination of the arbitrator chosen by the party or parties on the other side of the proposed arbitration will be unaffected, and the remaining arbitrators will be appointed in accordance with AAA Rules R. 12 and R. 13. 
 D. Any controversy concerning whether a Dispute is an arbitrable Dispute, whether arbitration has been waived, whether an assignee of this Agreement is bound to arbitrate, or as to the interpretation or enforceability of this Section 22.4 will be determined by the arbitrators. 
 E. The decision of the arbitral tribunal will be final and binding upon the parties, and such decision will be enforceable through any courts having jurisdiction. The arbitral tribunal will have no authority to amend or modify the terms of this Agreement. The arbitral tribunal may award or include in their award any relief they deem proper in the circumstances, including money damages (with Interest on unpaid amounts from the date due), specific performance and legal fees and costs in accordance with this Agreement however, the arbitral tribunal may not award special, punitive, consequential or exemplary damages. The costs and expenses of arbitration will be allocated and paid by the parties as determined by the arbitral tribunal. The arbitral tribunal will have the authority to make 
 87 

such orders granting interim or provisional relief during the pendency of the arbitration as it deems just and equitable. Any such order will be without prejudice to the final determination of the controversy. 
 F. The parties will use their reasonable best efforts to encourage the arbitrators to resolve any arbitration related to any Dispute as promptly as practicable. Subject to Applicable Law, including disclosure or reporting requirements, or the parties agreement, the parties will maintain the confidentiality of the arbitration. Unless agreed to by all the parties or required by Applicable Law, including disclosure or reporting requirements, the arbitrators and the parties will maintain the confidentiality of all information, records, reports, or other documents obtained in the course of the arbitration, and of all awards, orders, or other arbitral decisions rendered by the arbitrators. 
 G. Any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement will be conducted on an individual (not a class-wide) basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration proceedings to which Licensor is a party, except as specified below. No decision on any matter in any other arbitration proceeding in which Licensor is a party will prevent any party to the arbitration proceeding from submitting evidence with respect to the same or a similar matter or prevent the arbitral tribunal from rendering an independent decision without regard to such decision in such other arbitration proceeding. 
 H. Each party may, without waiving any rights it has under this Agreement, seek from a court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that may be necessary to protect its rights or property. 
 I. The provisions of this Section 22.4 will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

 B. If either party calls for a determination by Expert(s) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the parties shall have ten (10) days from the date of such request to agree upon and appoint an Expert and, if they fail to agree, each party shall have an additional ten (10) days to make its respective selection of an Expert, and within ten (10) days of such respective selections, the two (2) respective Experts so selected shall select a third (3rd) Expert. If either party fails to make its respective selection of an Expert within the specified period, then the other party s selection shall be the Expert. If the two (2) respective Experts selected by the parties fail to select a third (3rd) Expert, then the third Expert shall be appointed by the American Arbitration Association. Any dispute to be determined by the Expert pursuant to this Section shall, at the request of either party, be resolved in a single Expert proceeding before the same Expert(s) together with any dispute to be determined by an Expert arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

 (b) if, but for the operation of this clause (b) and notwithstanding clause (a) above, the Guarantor Obligations of Guarantor hereunder otherwise would be subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable state law relating to fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers, taking into consideration Guarantor s (i) rights of contribution, reimbursement and indemnity from Licensee with respect to amounts paid by Guarantor in respect of the Obligations (calculated so as to reasonably maximize the total amount of obligations able to be incurred hereunder), and (ii) rights of subrogation to the rights of Licensor, then the Guarantor Obligations of Guarantor shall be the largest amount, if any, that would not leave Guarantor, after the incurrence of such obligations, insolvent or with unreasonable small capital within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable state law relating to fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers, or otherwise make such obligations subject to such avoidance. 
 Any Person asserting that the Guarantor Obligations of Guarantor are subject to clause (a) or are avoidable as referenced in clause (b) shall have the burden (including the burden of production and of persuasion) of proving (i) the extent to which such Guarantor Obligations, by operation of clause (a), are less than the Obligations owed by Licensee to Licensor or (ii) that, without giving effect to clause (b), the Guarantor Obligations of Guarantor hereunder would be avoidable and the extent to which such Guarantor Obligations, by operation of clause (b), are less than the Obligations of Licensee, as the case may be.

 Marriott Milestones, Approvals & Phases 
 
 Our brands provide our guests with value and experience beyond expectation. We developed this process as a critical tool to illustrate the road map of checks and balances required in development on a wide range of scales, from conversions and renovations to new builds. 
 
 This document is a key document. As you progress through the design process, we periodically review the work. Our goal is to identify challenges early, so they can be fixed quickly and efficiently. 
 
 This document spells out the expected design submittals, and what items are to be included in each submittal. We've changed our submittal process to virtually eliminate paper and to handle most reviews electronically. We'll still need fabric and finish samples, but not printed drawings or specification books. At the beginning of each project, the Process is customized according to the project scope and phasing. 
 
 This document outlines the project management and reporting requirements as well as project closeout and opening requirements.

 The Licensee's Design Consultants develop a Design Narrative serving as the experiential brief for the property and informing the Project 's holistic design. A Design Narrative will be based upon the brand DNA and exists to ensure each Project is connected to the global portfolio through the consistent manifestation of the brand's core values. This ultimately brings strategic diversity to the portfolio, delineation amongst competitor brands, as well as further establishing brand affinity with new and existing guests around the world. 
 The Design Narrative should be developed through research investigation using the MI Design Narrative Tool. The resulting document will include research summaries, contextual insights, and visual image sets that showcase how the story can be understood. These visuals demonstrate how the specific narrative story, through exterior and interior architecture, programming, spatial layout and guest flow, interior design FF&E, graphics and artwork, create a unique Project experience with the brand core values as its roots. The Design Narrative will live in perpetuity over the lifetime of the Project and subsequently exist to drive future additions and or renovations.

 Marriott Milestones, Approvals & Phases 
 
 Our brands provide our guests with value and experience beyond expectation. We developed this process as a critical tool to illustrate the road map of checks and balances required in development for renovations. 
 
 This document is a key document. As you progress through the design process, we periodically review the work. Our goal is to identify challenges early, so they can be fixed quickly and efficiently. 
 
 This document spells out the expected design submittals, and what items are to be included in each submittal. We've changed our submittal process to virtually eliminate paper and to handle most reviews electronically. We'll still need fabric and finish samples, but not printed drawings or specification books. At the beginning of each project, the Process is customized according to the project scope and phasing. 
 
 This document outlines the project management and reporting requirements as well as project closeout.
