days of a hospice patient s care and a lower rate for days and after. In addition, there is a Service Intensity Add-on payment which covers direct home care visits conducted by a registered nurse or social worker in the last of a hospice patient s life, reimbursed up to hours per day in 15 minute increments at the continuous home care rate. General Inpatient Care occurs when a patient requires services in a controlled setting for a short period of time for pain control or symptom management which cannot be managed in other settings. General inpatient care services must be provided in a Medicare or Medicaid certified hospital or long-term care facility or at a freestanding inpatient hospice facility with the required registered nurse staffing. Continuous Home Care is provided to patients while at home, including a nursing home setting, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms. Continuous home care requires a minimum of hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins at midnight. The care must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed nurse practitioner. While the published Medicare continuous home care rates are daily rates, Medicare pays for continuous home care in 15 minute increments. This 15 minute rate is calculated by dividing the daily rate by 96. Respite Care permits a hospice patient to receive services on an inpatient basis for a short period of time in order to provide relief for the patient s family or other caregivers from the demands of caring for the patient. A hospice can receive payment for respite care for a given patient for up to five consecutive days at a time, after which respite care is reimbursed at the routine home care rate. Each level of care represents a separate promise under the contract of care and is provided independently for each patient contingent upon the patient s specific medical needs as determined by a physician. However, the clinical criteria used to determine a patient s level of care is consistent across all patients, given that, each patient is subject to the same payor rules and regulations. As a result, we have concluded that each level of care is capable of being distinct and is distinct in the context of the contract. Furthermore, we have determined that each level of care represents a stand ready service provided as a series of either days or hours of patient care. We believe that the performance obligations for each level of care meet criteria to be satisfied over time. VITAS recognizes revenue

months after discharge. Care is provided to patients regardless of their ability to pay. Patients who meet our criteria for charity care are provided care without charge. There is revenue or associated accounts receivable in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements related to charity care. The cost of providing charity care for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. The cost of providing charity care during the first nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. The cost of charity care is included in cost of services provided and goods sold and is calculated by taking the ratio of charity care days to total days of care and multiplying by the total cost of care. Generally, patients who are covered by third-party payors are responsible for related deductibles and coinsurance which vary in amount. VITAS also provides service to patients without a reimbursement source and may offer those patients discounts from standard charges. VITAS estimates the transaction price for patients with deductibles and coinsurance, along with those uninsured patients, based on historical experience and current conditions. The estimate of any contractual adjustments, discounts or implicit price concessions reduces the amount of revenue initially recognized. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are recorded as adjustments to patient service revenue in the period of change. Subsequent changes that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the patients ability to pay (i.e. change in credit risk) are recorded as bad debt expense. VITAS has no material adjustments related to subsequent changes in the estimate of the transaction price or subsequent changes as the result of an adverse change in the patient s ability to pay for any period reported. Laws and regulations concerning government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, are complex and subject to varying interpretation and change over time. Medicare and Medicaid programs have broad authority to audit and review compliance with such laws and regulations and impose payment suspensions or modifications when merited. Additionally, the contracts we have with commercial health insurance payors provide for retroactive audit and review of claims. Settlement with third party payors for retroactive adjustments due to audits, reviews or investigations are considered variable consideration and are included in the determination of the estimated transaction price for providing patient care. The variable consideration is estimated based on the terms of the payment agreement, existing correspondence from the payor and our historical settlement activity. These estimates are adjusted in future periods, as new information becomes available. We are subject to certain limitations on Medicare payments for services which are considered variable consideration, as follows: Inpatient Cap. If the number of inpatient care days any hospice program provides to Medicare beneficiaries exceeds of the total days of hospice care such program provided to all Medicare patients for an annual period beginning September 28, the days in excess of the figure may be reimbursed only at the routine homecare rate. None of VITAS hospice programs exceeded the payment limits on inpatient services during the three months ended September 30 , 2024 and 2023. Medicare Cap. We are also subject to a Medicare annual per-beneficiary cap Medicare cap ). Compliance with the Medicare cap is measured in one of two ways based on a provider election. The streamlined method compares total Medicare payments received under a Medicare provider number with respect to services provided to all Medicare hospice care beneficiaries in the program or programs covered by that Medicare provider number with the product of the per-beneficiary cap amount and the number of Medicare beneficiaries electing hospice care for the first time from that hospice program or programs from September 28 through September 27 of the following year. At September 30 , 2024, all our programs except one are using the streamlined method. The proportional method compares the total Medicare payments received under a Medicare provider number with respect to services provided to all Medicare hospice care beneficiaries in the program or programs covered by the Medicare provider number between September 28 and September 27 of the following year with the product of the per beneficiary cap amount and a pro-rated number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving hospice services from that program during the same period. The pro-rated number of Medicare beneficiaries is calculated based on the ratio of days the beneficiary received hospice services during the measurement period to the total number of days the beneficiary received hospice services. We actively monitor each of our hospice programs, by provider number, as to their specific admission, discharge rate and median length of stay data in an attempt to determine whether revenues are likely to exceed the annual per-beneficiary Medicare cap. Should we determine that revenues for a program are likely to exceed the Medicare cap based on projected trends, we attempt to institute corrective actions, which include changes to the patient mix and

This transaction creates a performance obligation in that VITAS is facilitating room and board being delivered to our patient.

 Roto-Rooter Roto-Rooter provides plumbing, drain cleaning, excavation, water restoration and other related services to both residential and commercial customers primarily in the United States. Services are provided through a network of company-owned branches, independent contractors and franchisees. Service revenue for Roto-Rooter is reported at the amount that reflects the ultimate consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing services. Roto-Rooter owns and operates branches focusing mainly on large population centers in the United States. Roto-Rooter s primary lines of business in company-owned branches consist of plumbing, sewer and drain cleaning, excavation and water restoration. For purposes of ASC 606 analysis, plumbing, sewer and drain cleaning, and excavation have been combined into one portfolio and are referred to as short-term core services . Water restoration is analyzed as a separate portfolio. The following describes the key characteristics of these portfolios: Short-term Core Services are plumbing, drain and sewer cleaning and excavation services. These services are provided to both commercial and residential customers. The duration of services provided in this category range from a few hours to a few days. There are no significant warranty costs or on-going obligations to the customer once a service has been completed. For residential customers, payment is received at the time of job completion before the Roto-Rooter technician leaves the residence. Commercial customers may be granted credit subject to internally designated authority limits and credit check guidelines. If credit is granted, payment terms are generally days or less. Each job in this category is a distinct service with a distinct performance obligation to the customer. Revenue is recognized at the completion of each job. Variable consideration consists of pre-invoice discounts and post-invoice discounts. Pre-invoice discounts are given in the form of coupons or price concessions. Post-invoice discounts consist of credit memos generally granted to resolve customer service issues. Variable consideration is estimated based on historical activity and recorded at the time service is completed. Water Restoration Services involve the remediation of water and humidity after a flood.

All performance obligations of Roto-Rooter cease at the termination of the arrangement. Independent contractors pay Roto-Rooter a standard fee calculated as a percentage of their cash collection from weekly sales. The primary value for the independent contractors under these arrangements is the right to use Roto-Rooter s registered trademarks. Roto-Rooter recognizes revenue from independent contractors over-time (weekly) as the independent contractor s labor sales are completed and payment from customers are received. Payment from independent contractors is also received on a weekly basis. The use of Roto-Rooter s registered trademarks and advertising provides immediate value to the independent contractor as a result of Roto-Rooter s nationally recognized brand. Therefore, over-time recognition provides the most faithful depiction of the transfer of services as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. There is no significant variable consideration related to these arrangements. Roto-Rooter has licensed the rights to operate under Roto-Rooter s registered trademarks in other territories to franchisees. Each such contract is for a year term but cancellable by Roto-Rooter for cause with day advance notice without penalty. The franchisee may cancel the contract for any reason with days advance notice without penalty. Under the terms of the contract, Roto-Rooter provides national advertising and consultation on various aspects of operating a Roto-Rooter business along with the right to use Roto-Rooter s registered trademarks. The franchisee is responsible for all day-to-day management of the business including staffing decisions, pricing of services provided and local advertising spend and placement. All performance obligations of Roto-Rooter cease at the termination of the arrangement. Franchisees pay Roto-Rooter a standard monthly fee based on the population within the franchise territory. The standard fee is revised on a yearly basis based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The primary value for the franchisees under this arrangement is the right to use Roto-Rooter s registered trademarks. Roto-Rooter recognizes revenue from franchisees over-time (monthly). Payment from franchisees is also received on a monthly basis. The use of Roto-Rooter s registered trademarks and advertising provides immediate value to the franchisees as a result of Roto-Rooter s nationally recognized brand. Therefore, over-time recognition provides the most faithful depiction of the transfer of services as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided.

million. On February 16, 2024, the CIC also granted PSUs that vest contingent upon the achievement of certain earnings per share EPS targets for the three-year period ending December 31, 2026. At the end of each reporting period, the Company estimates the number of shares that it believes will ultimately be earned and records the corresponding expense over the service period of the award. We currently estimate the cumulative compensation cost of the EPS-based PSUs to be recorded over the three-year service period is million . At the end of 2023, the then Chief Financial Officer (CFO) transitioned to an employee advisor role. In early 2024, in connection with this change of roles, the CFO s employment agreement terminated, and the CFO was given a one-time grant of PSUs to be paid based on the Company s TSR performance for the fiscal years 2024 to 2026. This one-time grant is structured the same as the Company s standard TSR-based PSU grants with the exception that there are no future service requirements to be satisfied by the employee and a minimum value of shares are guaranteed. Based on the structure of the one-time award, the entire value of the award, million, was recognized as compensation expense in SG A in the consolidated statements of income for the period ended March 31, 2024. 
 claims representing total Medicare reimbursement of million during this time period. From this population, OAS selected claims, representing of reimbursement, for detailed review. The final OAS audit report includes a series of recommendations, including that VITAS repay approximately million of the million VITAS received from Medicare for hospice services during this two-year period, despite the fact that at the time of the release of the results of the audit, many of the disputed claims were time-barred from being challenged. VITAS believes that the OAS audit process and related final report contain significant flaws including in methodology, medical reviews, technical reviews, proposed extrapolation methodology, and contravene the reasonable physician standard set forth in the appliable Aseracare precedent. On August 29, 2022, six weeks subsequent to the OAS finalizing its audit, VITAS received a demand letter from its Medicare Administrative Contractor MAC seeking repayment of million. This demand letter is million lower than the final OAS audit recommendation, as a significant portion of the claims reviewed were closed pursuant to applicable law and ineligible to be reopened. VITAS timely filed its initial appeal of the overpayment decision and deposited million under the Immediate Recoupment process to preserve its appeal rights. To date, VITAS has been refunded million of the amount deposited and continues to appeal the remaining claims through the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals process. The amount deposited has been recorded as an other long-term asset in the consolidated balance sheets, as detailed in Note 13.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary We operate through our two wholly-owned subsidiaries, VITAS Healthcare Corporation and Roto-Rooter Group, Inc. VITAS focuses on hospice care that helps make terminally ill patients final days as comfortable as possible. Through its teams of doctors, nurses, home health aides, social workers, clergy and volunteers, VITAS provides direct medical services to patients, as well as spiritual and emotional counseling to both patients and their families. Roto-Rooter s services are focused on providing plumbing, drain cleaning, excavation, water restoration and other related services to both residential and commercial customers. Through its network of company-owned branches, independent contractors and franchisees, Roto-Rooter offers plumbing and drain cleaning service to over 90 of the U.S. population. The vast majority of the Company s operations are located in the United States. As both operations are service companies, our employees are the most critical resource of the Company. We have very little exposure related to customers, vendors, or employees in other regions of the world. The following is a summary of the key operating results (in thousands except per share amounts): Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Service revenues and sales 606,181 564,532 1,791,294 1,678,505 Net income 75,776 74,958 211,680 182,456 Diluted EPS 5.00 4.93 13.88 12.02 Adjusted net income 85,485 80,866 248,735 207,701 Adjusted diluted EPS 5.64 5.32 16.31 13.68 Adjusted EBITDA 122,994 115,836 357,505 312,253 Adjusted EBITDA as a of revenue 20.3 20.5 20.0 18.6 
 Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of revenue are not measures derived in accordance with US GAAP. We provide non-GAAP measures to help readers evaluate our operating results and to compare our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures. Our non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures is presented on pages 35-37. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in consolidated service revenues and sales was driven by a 17.3 increase at VITAS offset by a 6.9 decrease at Roto-Rooter. The increase in service revenues at VITAS is comprised primarily of a 15.5 increase in days-of-care and a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase of approximately 2.6 . Acuity mix shift negatively impacted revenue growth by 140-basis points in the quarter when compared to the prior year revenue and level-of-care mix. The combination of Medicare cap and other contra revenue changes increased revenue growth by 64-basis points. The decrease in service revenues at Roto-Rooter was driven by a decrease in all service lines. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in consolidated service revenues and sales was driven by a 16.1 increase at VITAS offset by a 5.9 decrease at Roto-Rooter. The increase in service revenues at VITAS is comprised primarily of a 13.9 increase in days-of-care and a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase of approximately 2.6 . Acuity mix shift negatively impacted revenue growth by 110-basis points in the quarter when compared to the prior year revenue and level-of-care mix. The combination of Medicare cap and other contra revenue changes increased revenue growth by 70-basis points. The decrease in service revenues at Roto-Rooter was driven by a decrease in all service lines. On April 17, 2024, VITAS completed the purchase of all hospice operations and an assisted living facility from Covenant Health and Community Services, Inc d/b/a/ Covenant Care Covenant for an aggregated purchase price of 85.0 million in cash.

The pro forma revenue and earnings for the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, as if the Covenant acquisition made in 2024 was completed on January 1, 2023 are as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Service revenues and sales 606,181 578,472 1,808,426 1,720,325 Net income 75,776 76,735 215,905 187,786 Earnings per share 5.04 5.09 14.31 12.49 Diluted earnings per share 5.00 5.05 14.15 12.37 
 Hurricane Helene, which impacted the panhandle of Florida and other parts of the southeastern United States in late September, did not result in any significant property loss or damage to VITAS. However, as with other similar events, we did experience a slowdown in admission activity while health systems prepared for the hurricane and then dealt with the aftermath. We estimate that admissions were negatively impacted during the quarter by approximately 60-100 patients. We also believe that the Florida admission impact will be more significant in the fourth quarter with the combination of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. VITAS continues to perform as anticipated, and we reiterate the metrics for VITAS as presented in our second quarter 2024 press release. Roto-Rooter s revenue and resulting adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income was softer than anticipated during the third quarter of 2024. As a result of these factors, full-year 2024 earnings per diluted share, excluding non-cash expense for stock options, tax benefits from stock option exercises, costs related to litigation and other discrete items, is estimated to be in the range of 23.00 to 23.15. This range represents a 13.3 to 14.0 increase from Chemed s reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of 20.30. This guidance assumes an effective corporate tax rate on adjusted earnings of 24.3 and a diluted share count of 15.22 million shares. Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Material changes in the balance sheet accounts from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 include the following: A 20.5 million increase in investments of deferred compensation plans due mainly to market valuation gains. This resulted in a similar increase in the liability associated with deferred compensation plans. A 7.7 million increase in lease right of use asset due to lease renewals. This resulted in a similar increase in the lease liability accounts. A 4.5 million increase in identifiable intangible assets due primarily to the Covenant acquisition at VITAS. A 81.8 million increase in goodwill due primarily to the Covenant acquisition at VITAS. A 19.1 million decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments. A 3.5 million decrease in income taxes payable due to timing of payments. A 15.2 million decline in accrued compensation due primarily to the payment of 2023 bonuses in the first quarter of 2024. A 15.1 million decrease in other current liabilities due to payments of legal settlements at VITAS and Roto-Rooter, payments of the Retention Bonus Program implemented at VITAS and a decrease in the Medicare Cap liability at VITAS. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 30.8 million from September 30 , 2023 to September 30 , 2024. The main driver is an increase in earnings of 29.2 million. S ignificant changes in our accounts receivable balances are typically driven by the timing of payments received from the Federal government at our VITAS subsidiary. We typically receive a payment in excess of 50.0 million from the Federal government for hospice services every other Friday. The timing of a period end will have a significant impact on the accounts receivable at VITAS. These changes generally normalize over a two-year period, as cash flow variations in one year are offset in the following year. Management continually evaluates cash utilization alternatives, including share repurchase, debt repurchase, acquisitions and increased dividends to determine the most beneficial use of available capital resources. We anticipate that our operating income and cash flows will be sufficient to operate our business and meet any commitments for the foreseeable future.

Commitments and Contingencies On June 28, 2022, we replaced our existing credit facility with a fifth amended and restated Credit Agreement 2022 Credit Facilities ). Terms of the 2022 Credit Facilities consist of a five-year 450.0 million revolver as well as a five-year 100.0 million term loan. The 2022 Credit Facilities have a floating interest rate that is generally SOFR plus an additional tiered rate which varies based on our current leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate is SOFR plus 100 basis points. The 2022 Credit Facilities include an expansion feature that provides the Company the opportunity to increase its revolver and/or term loan by an additional 250.0 million. We made prepayments totaling 75.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, on the 100.0 million term loan. We paid the remaining balance of 21.3 million on April 28, 2023. There were no prepayment penalties associated with this repayment. This prepayment reduced the total borrowing capacity of the 2022 Credit Facilities from 550.0 million to 450.0 million. We have issued 45.2 million in standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2024, mainly for insurance purposes. Issued letters of credit reduce our available credit under the 2022 Credit Facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 404.8 million of unused lines of credit available and are eligible to be drawn down under our revolving credit facility. Management believes its liquidity and sources of capital are satisfactory for the Company s needs in the foreseeable future. Collectively, the terms of the 2022 Credit Facilities require us to meet various financial covenants, to be tested quarterly. We are in compliance with all financial and other debt covenants as of September 30, 2024 and anticipate remaining in compliance throughout the foreseeable future. We are subject to various lawsuits and claims in the normal course of our business. In addition, we periodically receive communications from governmental and regulatory agencies concerning compliance with Medicare and Medicaid billing requirements at our VITAS subsidiary. We establish reserves for specific, uninsured liabilities in connection with regulatory and legal action that we deem to be probable and estimable. We disclose the existence of regulatory and legal actions when we believe it is reasonably possible that a loss could occur in connection with the specific action. In most instances, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of any reasonably possible liability due to the uncertainty of the outcome and stage of litigation. We record legal fees associated with legal and regulatory actions as the costs are incurred. See Note 10 in the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 above for a description of current material legal matters.

Acuity mix shift negatively impacted revenue growth by 140-basis points in the quarter when compared to the prior year revenue and level-of-care mix. The combination of Medicare cap and other contra revenue changes increased revenue growth by 64-basis. The decrease in drain cleaning revenues for the third quarter of 2024 versus 2023 is attributable to a 3.6 increase in price and service mix offset by an 8.9 decrease in job count. The decrease in plumbing revenues for the third quarter of 2024 versus 2023 is

attributable to a 1.8 decrease in price and service mix shift and a 9.7 decrease in job count. Excavation and water restoration jobs are generally sold as a result of initial calls from customers regarding drain cleaning issues. The consolidated gross margin was 34.6 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared with 35.8 in the third quarter of 2023. On a segment basis, VITAS gross margin was 24.6 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared with 24.0 , in the third quarter of 2023.

VITAS after-tax earnings increased primarily due to increased revenues. Roto-Rooter s net income was negatively impacted in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to declining revenue and higher SG A related to enhanced marketing efforts. After-tax earnings as a percent of revenue at Roto-Rooter in the third quarter of 2024 was 17.7 , as compared to 21.8 in the third quarter of 2023.

 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 - Segment Results Net income/(loss) for the first nine months of 2024 versus the first nine months of 2023 by segment (in thousands): Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 VITAS 146,707 95,223 Roto-Rooter 119,326 142,354 Corporate (54,353) (55,121) 211,680 182,456 
 After-tax earnings as a percent of revenue at VITAS in the first nine months of 2024 was 13.1 as compared to 9.9 in the first nine months of 2023. VITAS after-tax earnings increased primarily due to increased revenues and the expiration of the licensed healthcare worker Retention Bonus Program in 2023. Roto-Rooter s net income was negatively impacted in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to declining revenue and higher SG A related to enhanced marketing efforts. After-tax earnings as a percent of revenue at Roto-Rooter in the first nine months of 2024 was 17.8 , as compared to 20.0 in the first nine months of 2023. After-tax Corporate expenses for the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 1.4 compared to the first nine months in 2023 primarily due to the tax benefit from the realignment of state and local corporate tax structure change recognized in September 2023.

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Regarding Forward-Looking Information Certain statements contained in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words believe , expect , hope , anticipate , plan and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and involve various known and unknown risks, uncertainties, contingencies and other factors, which could cause Chemed s actual results to differ from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Variances in any or all of the risks, uncertainties, contingencies, and other factors from our assumptions could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements and trends. In addition, our ability to deal with the unknown outcomes of these events, many of which are beyond our control, may affect the reliability of projections and other financial matters. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risk and there are no assurances that the matters contained in such statements will be achieved. Chemed does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company s primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk exposure through its variable interest line of credit. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no variable rate debt outstanding. For each 10 million borrowed under the credit facility, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points (1 ), increases or decreases the Company s annual interest expense by 100,000. The Company continually evaluates this interest rate exposure and periodically weighs the cost versus the benefit of fixing the variable interest rates through a variety of hedging techniques. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and with the participation of the Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Controller, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Controller have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings For information regarding the Company s legal proceedings , see Note 10, Legal and Regulatory Matters, under Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 1A. Risk Factors On October 4, 2024, CMS released a memo outlining the hospice Special Focus Program SFP criteria, and announcing that in November 2024, they would select the 50 hospices for participation in the SFP during the next calendar year. As we disclosed in our Annual Report on form 10-K, filed February 29,2024, the SFP is intended to identify poor performing hospices based on a number of indicators. Under an algorithm that it has developed for the SFP, CMS will identify the bottom 10 of performers and provide additional oversight over the lowest 1 of performers to assist the programs with continuous improvement. It is possible that certain VITAS hospice locations are included in the hospices that the algorithm identifies within the bottom 10 or even bottom 1 of hospices, and therefore selected for the SFP. Although CMS has stated that providers will not be able to replicate the results of the algorithm because not all information utilized by CMS has been made public, given what is known, large providers appear to be significantly more likely to be identified as poor performers because the formula does not account for size of program when analyzing the number of substantiated complaints. Additionally, providers who submit Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems CAHPS scores (as VITAS does) appear to be more likely to be identified as poor performers. Although there are no direct financial fines, fees, or other penalties or operational changes imposed due to selection in the SFP, the selection of one or more of VITAS programs in the SFP could have a material adverse effect on VITAS due to adverse effects on VITAS brand reputation and patient referral patterns. Additionally, participation in the SFP could materially increase costs of regulatory compliance for the programs selected to participate in the SFP due to additional government oversight and intervention in that program.
