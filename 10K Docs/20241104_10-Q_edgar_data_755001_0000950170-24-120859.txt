Cauti onary Statement This report and the documents incorporated by reference into this report contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included or incorporated by reference into this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy and other plans and objectives for the Company s future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements include declarations regarding the Company s beliefs and current expectations. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties include those described in Part II, Item 1A (Risk Factors) and the following: numerous hazards and operating risks relating to the Company s electric and natural gas distribution activities, which could result in accidents and other operating risks and costs; 

 fluctuations in the supply of, demand for, and the prices of, electric and gas energy commodities and transmission and transportation capacity and the Company s ability to recover energy supply costs in its rates; 

 catastrophic events; 

 cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, acts of war, severe weather, a solar event, an electromagnetic event, a natural disaster, the age and condition of information technology assets, human error, or other factors could disrupt the Company s operations and cause the Company to incur unanticipated losses and expense; 

 outsourcing of services to third parties could expose the Company to substandard quality of service delivery or substandard deliverables, which may result in missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, non-compliance (including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards) or reputational harm, which could negatively affect our results of operations; 

 unforeseen or changing circumstances, which could adversely affect the reduction of Company-wide direct greenhouse gas emissions; 

 the Company s regulatory and legislative environment (including laws and regulations relating to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental matters) could affect the rates the Company is able to charge, the Company s authorized rate of return, the Company s ability to recover costs in its rates, the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the scope of the Company s regulated activities; 

 general economic conditions, which could adversely affect (i) the Company s customers and, consequently, the demand for the Company s distribution services, (ii) the availability of credit and liquidity resources, and (iii) certain of the Company s counterparty s obligations (including those of its insurers and lenders); 

 the Company s ability to obtain debt or equity financing on acceptable terms; 

 increases in interest rates, which could increase the Company s interest expense; 

 declines in capital market valuations, which could require the Company to make substantial cash contributions to cover its pension obligations, and the Company s ability to recover pension obligation costs in its rates; 

 restrictive covenants contained in the terms of the Company s and its subsidiaries indebtedness, which restrict certain aspects of the Company s business operations; 

 customers preferred energy sources; 

 severe storms and the Company s ability to recover storm costs in its rates; 

 variations in weather, which could decrease demand for the Company s distribution services; 

 long-term global climate change, which could adversely affect customer demand or cause extreme weather events that could disrupt the Company s electric and natural gas distribution services; 

 Employee workforce factors, including the ability to attract and retain key personnel; 

2 

the Company s ability to retain its existing customers and attract new customers; 

 increased competition; and 

 other presently unknown or unforeseen factors. 

 Many of these risks are beyond the Company s control. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict all such factors, nor can the Company assess the effect of any such factor on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. PART I. FINANC IAL INFORMATION Item 2. Man agement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Unitil Corporation s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. OVERVIEW Unitil Corporation (Unitil or the Company) is a public utility holding company headquartered in Hampton, New Hampshire. Unitil and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation as a holding company system by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Unitil s principal business is the local distribution of electricity and gas throughout its service territory in the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine. Unitil is the parent company of three wholly-owned distribution utilities: i) Unitil Energy Systems, Inc. (Unitil Energy), which provides electric service in the southeastern seacoast and state capital regions of New Hampshire, including the capital city of Concord; 

 ii) Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company (Fitchburg), which provides both electric and gas service in the greater Fitchburg area of north central Massachusetts; and 

 iii) Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities), which provides gas service in southeastern New Hampshire and portions of southern and central Maine, including the city of Portland, which is the largest city in northern New England. 

 Unitil Energy, Fitchburg and Northern Utilities are collectively referred to as the distribution utilities. Together, the distribution utilities serve approximately 108,500 electric customers and 88,400 gas customers. In addition, Unitil is the parent company of Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc. (Granite State), an interstate gas transmission pipeline company, operating 85 miles of underground gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. Granite State provides Northern Utilities with interconnection to major gas pipelines and access to domestic gas supplies in the south and Canadian gas supplies in the north. Unitil had an investment in Net Utility Plant of 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024. Earnings from Unitil s utility operations are derived primarily from the return on investment in the utility assets of the three distribution utilities and Granite State. Unitil s total operating revenue includes revenue to recover the approved cost of purchased electricity and gas in rates on a fully reconciling basis. As a result of this reconciling rate structure, the Company s earnings are not directly affected by changes in the cost of purchased electricity and gas. Unitil Resources is the Company s wholly-owned, non-regulated subsidiary. The Company s other subsidiaries include Unitil Service Corp., which provides, at cost, a variety of administrative and professional services to Unitil s affiliated companies; Unitil Realty Corp., which owns and manages Unitil s corporate office building and property located in Hampton, New Hampshire and land for future use located in Kensington, New Hampshire; and Unitil Power Corp., which formerly functioned as the full requirements wholesale power supply provider for Unitil Energy. Unitil s consolidated net income includes the earnings of the holding company and these subsidiaries.

RATES AND REGULATION Regulation Unitil is subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state regulatory authorities. Unitil and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation as a holding company system by the FERC under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 with regard to certain bookkeeping, accounting and reporting requirements. Unitil s utility operations related to wholesale and interstate energy business activities are also regulated by the FERC. Unitil s distribution utilities are subject to regulation by the applicable state public utility commissions with regard to their rates, issuance of securities and other accounting and operational matters: Unitil Energy is subject to regulation by the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC); Fitchburg is subject to regulation by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (MDPU); and Northern Utilities is regulated by the NHPUC and the Maine Public Utilities Commission (MPUC). Granite State, Unitil s interstate gas transmission pipeline, is subject to regulation by FERC with regard to its rates and operations. Because Unitil s primary operations are subject to rate regulation, the regulatory treatment of various matters could significantly affect the Company s operations and financial position. Unitil s distribution utilities deliver electricity and/or gas to all customers in their service territory, at rates established under cost of service regulation. Under this regulatory structure, Unitil s distribution utilities recover the cost of providing distribution service to their customers based on historical test years, and earn a return on their capital investment in utility assets. The Company s distribution utilities and its gas transmission pipeline company also may recover certain base rate costs, including capital project spending, qualifying storm expenses and enhanced reliability and vegetation management programs, through annual step adjustments or cost tracking rate mechanisms. Revenue decoupling is the term given to the elimination of the dependency of a utility s distribution revenue on the volume of electricity or gas sales. The difference between distribution revenue amounts billed to customers and the targeted revenue decoupling amounts is recognized as an increase or a decrease in Accrued Revenue, which forms the basis for resetting rates for future cash recoveries from, or credits to, customers. These revenue decoupling targets may be adjusted as a result of rate cases and other authorized adjustments that the Company files with the MDPU and NHPUC. Fitchburg has been subject to revenue decoupling since 2011. Unitil Energy has been subject to revenue decoupling since June 1, 2022. As a result of Unitil Energy now being subject to revenue decoupling, as of June 1, 2022, revenue decoupling now applies to substantially all of Unitil s total annual electric sales volumes. Substantially all of Northern Utilities gas sales volumes in New Hampshire have been subject to decoupling since August 1, 2022. The Company's electric and gas sales in New Hampshire and Massachusetts are now largely decoupled. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following section of MD A compares the results of operations for each of the two fiscal periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The Company s results of operations historically have reflected the seasonal nature of the gas business. Annual gas revenues are substantially realized during the heating season as a result of higher sales of gas due to cold weather. Accordingly, the results of operations are historically most favorable in the first and fourth quarters. Fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions may have a significant effect on the results of operations. Sales of electricity are generally less sensitive to weather than gas sales, but also may be affected by the weather conditions in both the winter and summer seasons. The MD A includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's management believes that the non-GAAP presentations of earnings and Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margins are a more meaningful representation of the Company's financial performance and provides additional and useful information to readers of this report in analyzing the historical and future performance of the business. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company's earnings discussion includes Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure referencing our 2024 GAAP Net Income less certain transaction costs related to the Company's acquisition of Bangor Natural Gas Company (Bangor), which it disclosed previously in 2024. The Company's management believes that the transaction costs related to the acquisition of Bangor, which are included in Operation and Maintenance expense on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, are not indicative of the 

 4 

Company's ongoing costs and not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business and therefore not an indicator of baseline operating performance. In the following tables the Company has reconciled Adjusted Net Income to GAAP Net Income, which we believe to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure.

 The Company analyzes operating results using Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margins, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Electric Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated as Total Electric Operating Revenue less Cost of Electric Sales. Gas Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated as Total Gas Operating Revenues less Cost of Gas Sales. The Company s management believes Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margins are important financial measures to analyze revenue from the Company s ongoing operations because the approved cost of electric and gas sales are tracked, reconciled and passed through directly to customers in electric and gas tariff rates, resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in Total Electric and Gas Operating Revenue. In the following tables the Company has reconciled Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margin to GAAP Gross Margin, which we believe to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure. GAAP Gross Margin is calculated as Revenue less Cost of Sales, and Depreciation and Amortization. The Company calculates Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margin as Revenue less Cost of Sales. The Company believes excluding Depreciation and Amortization, which are period costs and not related to volumetric sales, is a meaningful measure to inform investors of the Company s profitability from electric and gas sales in the period.

Electric Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP financial measure) was 29.7 million and 81.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, increases of 0.5 million and 1.6 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. These increases reflect higher rates and customer growth. Kilowatt-hour Sales - Unitil s total electric kWh sales increased 2.6 and 2.2 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Sales to Residential and Commercial and Industrial (C I) customers increased 4.1 and 1.5 , respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting warmer weather for cooling purposes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, and customer growth. Sales to Residential and C I customers increased 2.7 and 1.9 , respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting warmer weather for cooling purposes in 2024 compared to 2023, and customer growth. Based on weather data collected in the Company's electric service areas, on average there were 12.2 more Cooling Degree Days in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the number of electric customers increased by approximately 1,100 over the previous year. Sales margins derived from decoupled unit sales are not sensitive to changes in electric kWh sales. Substantially all of the Company s electric kWh sales volumes are decoupled.

Therm Sales - Unitil s total gas therm sales decreased 0.4 and 0.5 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, sales to Residential customers were essentially unchanged and sales to C I customers decreased 0.4 , compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting lower average usage, partially offset by customer growth. In the first nine months of 2024, sales to Residential and C I customers decreased 0.9 and 0.4 , respectively, compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting warmer winter weather in 2024 compared to 2023 and lower average usage, partially offset by customer growth and colder early spring weather in 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the number of gas customers increased by approximately 720 over the previous year. Sales margins derived from decoupled unit sales (currently representing approximately 42 of total annual therm sales volume) are not sensitive to changes in gas therm sales, although those sales margins are sensitive to changes in the number of customers served.

 Operating Expenses Cost of Electric Sales - Cost of Electric Sales includes the cost of electric supply and spending on energy efficiency programs. Cost of Electric Sales decreased 10.1 million, or 23.5 , and 53.9 million, or 32.7 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. These decreases reflect lower wholesale electricity prices and an increase in the amount of electricity purchased by customers directly from third-party suppliers, partially offset by higher sales of electricity. Because the Company reconciles and recovers the approved Cost of Electric Sales in its rates at cost on a pass-through basis, changes in approved expenses do not affect earnings. Cost of Gas Sales - Cost of Gas Sales includes the cost to supply the Company s total gas requirements and spending on energy efficiency programs. Cost of Gas Sales decreased 2.5 million, or 26.0 , and 17.1 million, or 22.4 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. These decreases primarily reflect lower wholesale gas commodity prices, lower gas therm sales and an increase in the amount of gas purchased by customers directly from third-party suppliers. Because the Company reconciles and recovers the approved Cost of Gas Sales in its rates at cost on a pass-through basis, changes in approved expenses do not affect earnings. Operation and Maintenance (O M) - O M expense includes electric and gas utility operating costs, and the operating cost of the Company s corporate and other business activities. O M expense increased 0.7 million, or 3.6 , and 1.1 million, or 2.0 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in the three month period reflects higher labor costs of 0.4 million and higher utility operating costs of 0.3 million. The increase in the nine month period reflects higher labor costs of 0.9 million and higher utility operating costs of 0.2 million. Depreciation and Amortization - Depreciation and Amortization expense increased 2.3 million, or 13.7 , and 5.1 million, or 10.2 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, reflecting higher depreciation rates resulting from recent base rate cases, additional depreciation associated with higher levels of utility plant in service, and higher amortization of storm costs and other deferred costs. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes - Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased 0.8 million, or 11.4 , and 1.5 million, or 7.1 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, reflecting higher local property taxes on higher utility plant in service and higher payroll taxes. Other (Income) Expense, Net - Other (Income) Expense, Net decreased 0.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting lower retirement benefit costs. Other (Income) Expense, Net increased 0.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting higher retirement benefit costs. Provision for Income Taxes - Federal and State Income Taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.9 million and increased 0.1 million, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2023. The decrease in the three month period 

 9 

reflects lower pre-tax earnings in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in the nine month period reflects higher pre-tax earnings in the first nine months of 2024. Interest Expense, Net - Interest expense is presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements net of interest income. Interest expense is mainly comprised of interest on long-term debt and short-term borrowings. In addition, certain reconciling rate mechanisms used by the Company s distribution operating utilities give rise to regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities on which interest is accrued. Unitil s utility subsidiaries operate a number of reconciling rate mechanisms to recover specifically identified costs on a pass-through basis. These reconciling rate mechanisms track costs and revenue on a monthly basis. In any given month, this tracking and reconciling process will produce either an under-collected or an over-collected position. In accordance with the distribution utilities rate tariffs, interest is accrued on these balances and will produce either interest income or interest expense. Consistent with regulatory precedent, interest income is recorded on an under-collection of costs which creates a regulatory asset to be recovered in future periods when rates are reset. Interest expense is recorded on an over-collection of costs, which creates a regulatory liability to be refunded in future periods when rates are reset.

 Interest Expense, Net increased 0.4 million, or 5.7 , and 1.0 million, or 4.7 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily reflecting higher interest expense on short-term borrowings and higher levels of long-term debt, partially offset by higher interest income on regulatory assets and other interest income. Capital RequirementS Sources of Capital Unitil requires capital to fund utility plant additions, working capital and other utility expenditures recovered in subsequent periods through regulated rates. The capital necessary to meet these requirements is derived primarily from internally generated funds, which consist of cash flows from operating activities. The Company initially supplements internally generated funds through short-term bank borrowings, as needed, under its unsecured revolving Credit Facility. Periodically, the Company replaces portions of its short-term debt with long-term debt financings more closely matched to the long-term nature of its utility assets. Additionally, from time to time the Company accesses the public capital markets through public offerings of equity securities. The Company s utility operations have a seasonal component and therefore are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flows. The amount, type and timing of any future financing will vary from year to year based on capital needs and maturity or redemptions of securities. The Company and its subsidiaries are individually and collectively members of the Unitil Cash Pool (Cash Pool). The Cash Pool is the financing vehicle for day-to-day cash borrowing and investing. The Cash Pool allows for an efficient exchange of cash among the Company and its subsidiaries. The interest rates charged to the subsidiaries for borrowing from the Cash Pool are based on actual interest costs from lenders under the Company s revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). At September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023, the Company and all of its subsidiaries were in compliance with the regulatory requirements to participate in the Cash Pool. On September 29, 2022, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders (collectively, the "Credit Facility ), which amended and restated in its entirety the prior credit facility. Unitil may borrow under the Credit Facility until September 29, 2027, subject to two one-year extensions under certain circumstances. The Credit Facility 

 10 

terminates and all amounts outstanding thereunder are due and payable on September 29, 2027, subject to the potential extension discussed in the prior sentence. The Credit Facility has a borrowing limit of 200 million, which includes a 25 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit. Unitil may increase the borrowing limit under the Credit Facility by up to 75 million under certain circumstances. The Credit Facility generally provides Unitil with the ability to elect that borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest under several options, including a daily fluctuating rate equal to (a) the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate (as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) term rate with a term equivalent to one month beginning on that date, plus (b) 0.1000 , plus (c) a margin of 1.125 to 1.375 (based on Unitil s credit rating). The Company utilizes the Credit Facility for cash management purposes related to its short-term operating activities. Total gross borrowings were 229.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Total gross repayments were 327.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The following table details the borrowing limits, amounts outstanding and amounts available under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023:

The Credit Facility contains customary terms and conditions for credit facilities of this type, including affirmative and negative covenants. There are restrictions on, among other things, Unitil s and its subsidiaries ability to incur liens or incur indebtedness, and restrictions on Unitil s ability to merge or consolidate with another entity or change its line of business. The affirmative and negative covenants under the Credit Facility shall apply to Unitil until the Credit Facility terminates and all amounts borrowed under Credit Facility are paid in full (or, with respect to letters of credit, they are cash-collateralized). The only financial covenant in the Credit Facility provides that Unitil s Funded Debt to Capitalization (as each term is defined in the Credit Facility) cannot exceed 65 , tested on a quarterly basis. At September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with the covenants contained in the Credit Facility in effect on those dates. On July 6, 2023, Fitchburg issued 12.0 million of Notes due July 2, 2033, at 5.70 and 13.0 million of Notes due July 2, 2053 at 5.96 . Fitchburg used the net proceeds from these offerings to refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes. Approximately 0.2 million of costs associated with this issuance were recorded as a reduction of Long-Term Debt for presentation purposes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the third quarter of 2023. On August 21, 2024, Unitil Corporation issued 20.0 million of Notes due 2034 at 5.99 . Fitchburg issued 12.5 million of Notes due 2034 at 5.54 and 12.5 million of Notes due 2044 at 5.99 . Unitil Energy issued 40.0 million of Bonds due 2054 at 5.69 . Northern Utilities issued 25.0 million of Notes due 2034 at 5.54 and 15.0 million of Notes due 2039 at 5.74 . Granite State issued 10.0 million of Notes due 2034 at 5.74 . The Company used the net proceeds from these offerings to refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes. Approximately 1.0 million of costs associated with this issuance were recorded as a reduction of Long-Term Debt for presentation purposes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the third quarter of 2024. Unitil Corporation and its utility subsidiaries, Fitchburg, Unitil Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite State currently are rated BBB+ by Standard Poor s Ratings Services. Unitil Corporation and Granite State currently are rated Baa2 , and Fitchburg, Unitil Energy and Northern Utilities are currently rated Baa1 by Moody s Investors Services. The continued availability of various methods of financing, as well as the choice of a specific form of security for such financing, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: security market conditions; general economic climate; regulatory approvals; the ability to meet covenant issuance restrictions; the level of earnings, cash flows and financial position; and the competitive pricing offered by financing sources. The Company provides limited guarantees on certain energy and gas storage management contracts entered into by the distribution utilities. The Company s policy is to limit the duration of these guarantees. As of September 30, 2024, there were no guarantees outstanding. 

 11 

Northern Utilities enters into asset management agreements under which Northern Utilities releases certain gas pipeline and storage assets, sells to an asset manager and subsequently repurchases the gas over the course of the gas heating season at the same price at which it sold the gas to the asset manager. There was 8.8 million of natural gas storage inventory and corresponding obligations at September 30, 2024 related to these asset management agreements. The amount of natural gas inventory released in September 2024, which was payable in October 2024, was less than 0.1 million and was recorded in Accounts Payable at September 30, 2024. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company and its subsidiaries do not currently use, and are not dependent on the use of, off-balance sheet financing arrangements such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets or cash through special purpose entities or variable interest entities. Unitil Corporation s subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in leased facilities, and lease some of their vehicles, machinery and office equipment under both capital and operating lease arrangements. See Note 4 (Debt and Financing Arrangements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In making those estimates and assumptions, the Company sometimes is required to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements. If actual results were to differ significantly from those estimates, assumptions and judgment, the financial position of the Company could be materially affected and the results of operations of the Company could be materially different than reported. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates had not changed significantly from December 31, 2023. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. EMPLOYEES As of September 30, 2024, the Company and its subsidiaries had 541 employees. The Company considers its relationship with employees to be good and has not experienced any major labor disruptions. The Company strives to be the employer of choice in the communities it serves regardless of race, religion, color, gender, or sexual orientation. The Company works diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources to meet the current and future demands of our business. To attract and retain a talented workforce, Unitil provides employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. All employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leave, educational assistance, retirement plan and life and disability/accident coverage. Feedback from employees is collected annually in the Company s Employee Opinion survey. This feedback helps create action plans to improve the engagement of employees consistent with the Company s culture of continuous improvement. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 173 employees of certain of the Company s subsidiaries were represented by labor unions. The following table details by subsidiary the employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) as of September 30, 2024:

INTEREST RATE RISK Unitil meets its external financing needs by issuing short-term and long-term debt. The majority of debt outstanding represents long-term notes or bonds bearing fixed rates of interest. Changes in market interest rates do not affect interest expense resulting from these outstanding long-term debt securities. However, the Company periodically repays its short-term debt borrowings through the issuance of new long-term debt securities. Changes in market interest rates may affect the interest rate and corresponding interest expense on any new issuances of long-term debt securities. In addition, short-term debt borrowings bear a variable rate of interest. As a result, changes in short-term interest rates will increase or decrease interest expense in future periods. For example, if the average amount of short-term debt outstanding was 25 million for the period of one year, a change in interest rates of 1 would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately 250,000. The average interest rates on the Company s short-term borrowings and intercompany money pool transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 6.6 and 6.4 , respectively. The average interest rates on the Company s short-term borrowings and intercompany money pool transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 6.6 and 6.2 , respectively. The average interest rate on the Company s short-term borrowings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was 6.4 . COMMODITY PRICE RISK Although Unitil s three distribution utilities are subject to commodity price variations as part of their traditional operations, the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of electric power and natural gas supply costs in rates on a pass-through basis. Consequently, there is limited commodity price risk after consideration of the related rate-making. As discussed in Note 6 (Regulatory Matters), the Company has divested its long-term power supply contracts and therefore, further reduced its exposure to commodity risk. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of Regulatory Matters. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of Environmental Matters.

Revenue decoupling is the term given to the elimination of the dependency of a utility s distribution revenue on the volume of electricity or gas sales. The difference between distribution revenue amounts billed to customers and the targeted revenue decoupling amounts is recognized as an increase or a decrease in Accrued Revenue, which forms the basis for resetting rates for future cash recoveries from, or credits to, customers. These revenue decoupling targets may be adjusted as a result of rate cases and other authorized adjustments that the Company files with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (MDPU) and New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC). Fitchburg has been subject to revenue decoupling since 2011. Unitil Energy has been subject to revenue decoupling since June 1, 2022. As a result of Unitil Energy now being subject to revenue decoupling, as of June 1, 2022, revenue decoupling now applies to substantially all of Unitil s total annual electric sales volumes. Substantially all of Northern Utilities gas sales volumes in New Hampshire have been subject to decoupling since August 1, 2022. The Company's electric and gas sales in New Hampshire and Massachusetts are now largely decoupled.

The Company has elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components and instead to account for both as a single lease component. The Company s accounting policy election for leases with a lease term of 12 months or less is to recognize the lease payments as lease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Generally, the Company receives a return on investment on its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. Included in Regulatory Assets as of September 30, 2024 a re million of environmental costs, rate case costs and other expenditures to be recovered over varying periods in the next seven years. Regulators have authorized recovery of these expenditures, but without a return. Regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, which can have a material effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes it is probable that its regulated distribution and transmission utilities will recover their investments in long-lived assets, including regulatory assets. If the Company, or a portion of its assets or operations, were to cease meeting the criteria for application of these accounting rules, accounting standards for businesses in general would become applicable and immediate recognition of any previously deferred costs, or a portion of deferred costs, would be required in the year in which the criteria are no longer met, if such deferred costs were not recoverable in the portion of the business that continues to meet the criteria for application of the FASB Codification topic on Regulated Operations. If unable to continue to apply the FASB Codification provisions for Regulated Operations, the Company would be required to apply the provisions for the Discontinuation of Rate-Regulated Accounting included in the FASB Codification. In the Company s opinion, its regulated operations will be subject to the FASB Codification provisions for Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future.

The Company also sponsors the Unitil Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the DC Plan ). The DC Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that provides a vehicle for participants to accumulate tax-deferred savings to supplement retirement income. The DC Plan, which was effective January 1, 2019, is open to senior management or other highly compensated employees as determined by the Company s Board of Directors, and may also be used for recruitment and retention purposes for newly hired senior executives. The DC Plan design mirrors the Company s Tax Deferred Savings and Investment Plan formula, but provides for contributions on compensation above the IRS limit, which will allow participants to defer up to 85 of base salary, and up to 85 of any cash incentive for retirement. The Company may also elect to make discretionary contributions on behalf of any participant in an amount determined by the Company s Board of Directors. A trust has been established to invest the funds associated with the DC Plan. At September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company s investments in these trading securities related to the DC Plan, which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Assets, were million, million and million, respectively, as shown in the following table.

Exchange Gas Obligation - Northern Utilities enters into gas exchange agreements under which Northern Utilities releases certain gas pipeline and storage assets, sells the gas storage inventory to an asset manager and subsequently repurchases the inventory over the course of the gas heating season at the same price at which it sold the gas inventory to the asset manager. The gas inventory related to these agreements is recorded in Exchange Gas Receivable on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets while the corresponding obligations are recorded in Energy Supply Obligations. Renewable Energy Portfolio Standards - Renewable Energy Portfolio Standards (RPS) require retail electricity suppliers, including public utilities, to demonstrate that required percentages of their sales are met with power generated from certain types of resources or

million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The transaction is expected to be financed initially with an unsecured short-term loan facility and ultimately financed with a balanced mix of equity and private placement debt. The transacting parties jointly submitted a petition seeking approval of the Acquisition with the MPUC on July 15, 2024. The Company is also seeking approval of various affiliate agreements between the Company, its subsidiaries, and Bangor. Furthermore, Unitil requested that the MPUC issue an order excusing Bangor and Unitil from certain regulatory conditions and obligations imposed upon Bangor or its affiliates in conjunction with prior reorganizations of Bangor and finding that the value of certain assets for cost of service ratemaking purposes is not less than the depreciated original cost of those assets. This matter remains pending.

Fair Value of Long-Term Debt - Currently, the Company believes there is no active market in the Company s debt securities, which have all been sold through private placements. If there were an active market for the Company s debt securities, the fair value of the Company s long-term debt would be estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues, or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of the Company s long-term debt is estimated using Level 2 inputs (valuations based on quoted prices available in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable, and inputs derived principally from market data). In estimating the fair value of the Company s long-term debt, the assumed market yield reflects the Moody s Baa Utility Bond Average Yield. Costs, including prepayment costs, associated with the early settlement of long-term debt are not taken into consideration in determining fair value.

Unitil Energy - Base Rates - On May 3, 2022, the NHPUC issued an Order in the distribution base rate case filed with the NHPUC on April 2, 2021 by Unitil Energy. The Order approved, in part, a comprehensive Settlement Agreement between the Company, the New Hampshire DOE, the OCA, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, Clean Energy New Hampshire, and ChargePoint, Inc. In addition to authorizing an increase to permanent distribution rates of million, effective June 1, 2022, the Order approved the following components of the Settlement Agreement: (1) a multi-year rate plan, (2) a revenue decoupling mechanism, (3) time-of-use rates, (4) resiliency programs to support the Company s commitment to reliability, and (5) other rate design and tariff changes. On May 10, 2022, the Company filed a request for clarification with the NHPUC to clarify that the authorized revenue requirement should exclude expenses related to the Company s proposed Arrearage Management Program (AMP), which was not approved in the Order. On May 12, 2022, the Commission issued an Order, which clarified that because the Company will not incur the expenses associated with the AMP, those costs should be removed from the revenue requirement, and that the adjusted increase of million will result in reasonable rates. The increase in permanent rates was reconciled back to June 1, 2021, the effective date of temporary rates previously approved in this docket. This distribution base rate case reflected the Company s operating costs and investments in utility plant for a test year ended December 31, 2020 as adjusted for known and measurable changes. The Order provided for a return on equity of and a capital structure reflecting equity and long-term debt.

Fitchburg - Base Rates - Electric - Fitchburg s base rates are decoupled and subject to an annual revenue decoupling adjustment mechanism, which includes a cap on the amount that rates may be increased in any year. In addition, Fitchburg has an annual capital cost recovery mechanism to recover the revenue requirement associated with certain capital additions. On July 26, 2023, the MDPU issued an Order approving the Company's cumulative revenue requirement of million associated with its 2019-2021 capital expenditures. On September 11, 2024, the MDPU issued a final order approving the cumulative revenue requirement of million associated with its 2019-2022 capital expenditures. On November 1, 2024, Fitchburg filed its cumulative revenue requirem ent of million associated with its 2023 capital expenditures, which reflects the transfer of capital expenditures associated with its 2019-2023 year investments into base distribution rates effective July 1, 2024. This matter remains pending. On August 17, 2023, Fitchburg filed a petition with the MDPU seeking approval for a million increase to base distribution rates, with new rates to be effective July 1, 2024. Fitchburg also requested, among other things, approval for a performance-based ratemaking (PBR) plan for up to a five-year term and continuation of its revenue decoupling mechanism. On June 28, 2024, the MDPU issued an Order providing for a million increase to base rates, effective July 1, 2024. This includes a transfer of million in costs from certain reconciling mechanisms to base distribution rates.

million through 2025 for previously deployed or preauthorized grid modernization investments. On November 30, 2022, the MDPU issued its Track 2 Order addressing new technologies and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) proposals. The MDPU preauthorizes a four-year million budget for Fitchburg s additional grid-facing investments. Any spending over the total budget cap is not eligible for targeted cost recovery through its Grid Modernization Factor (GMF), and instead, may be recovered by the Company in a base distribution rate proceeding subsequent to a prudency finding by the MDPU in a GMF filing or term review Order. The MDPU also preauthorized the Company s AMI meter replacement investments, with a budget of million through 2025. Additionally, the MDPU provided preliminary approval for the Company s customer engagement and experience and data sharing platform investments, with a combined budget of million through 2025. The Company may recover eligible costs incurred for preauthorized grid-facing investments and customer-facing investments that will be made during the 2022-2025 GMP term through the GMFs, subject to certain modifications to the Company s GMF tariff and a final prudence review.

Fitchburg - Investigation into the role of gas LDCs to achieve Commonwealth 2050 climate goals - The MDPU has opened an investigation to examine the role of Massachusetts gas local distribution companies (LDCs) in helping the Commonwealth achieve its 2050 climate goal of net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In its Order opening the inquiry, the MDPU stated it is required to consider new policies and structures as the Commonwealth reduces reliance on fossil fuels, including natural gas, which may require LDCs to make significant changes to their planning processes and business models. The LDCs, including Fitchburg, engaged an independent consultant to conduct a study and prepare a report (Consultant Report), including a detailed study of each LDC, that analyzes the feasibility of all identified pathways to help the Commonwealth achieve its net-zero GHG goal. The study includes an examination of the potential pathways identified in the 2050 Decarbonization Roadmap developed by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, in consultation with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER). On December 6, 2023, the MDPU issued an Order announcing a regulatory framework intended to set forth its role and that of the LDCs in helping the Commonwealth achieve its target of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. In this proceeding, the MDPU reviewed eight potential decarbonization pathways and six regulatory design recommendations intended to facilitate the Commonwealth s transition. The MDPU made no specific findings as to a preferred pathway or technology, but did make specific findings regarding regulatory design recommendations. The MDPU instructed the LDCs in their next rate case to revise their per-customer revenue decoupling mechanism to a decoupling approach based on total revenues. The MDPU emphasized that the Order is not intended to jeopardize the rate recovery of existing investments in natural gas infrastructure by Fitchburg. As part of future cost recovery proposals, LDCs will bear the burden of demonstrating that non-gas pipeline alternatives (NPAs) were adequately considered and

million budget consisting of: (1) public infrastructure offering million); (2) Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) incentives for residential segment million); and (3) marketing and outreach million). The Company may shift spending between program segments and between years over the five-year term of its program, subject to a 15 cap. Any spending above the approved EV program budget or above the 15 cap for each program segment is not eligible for targeted cost recovery through the GMF and, instead, may be recovered in a base distribution rate proceeding subsequent to a prudency finding by the MDPU. The MDPU s Order directs the Companies to submit annual reports that document their performance and these reports are due on or before May 15th of each year. The MDPU accepted the Company s Demand Charge Alternative proposal and directed implementation within six months. The Demand Charge Alternative is offered for a ten-year period beginning July 1, 2023 with tiered rates to separately-metered EV general delivery service customers. The MDPU also accepted the Company s proposed residential EV TOU rate, effective April 1, 2023. In June 2023, the MDPU convened an EV stakeholder process to finalize EV program performance metrics. On April 3, 2023, the electric companies filed comments on the MDPU s proposed metrics. On December 15, 2023, the MDPU approved EV performance metrics. Following that approval, the MDPU required the electric companies to develop a joint state-wide program evaluation plan for MDPU approval and stakeholder input. On May 15, 2024, Fitchburg submitted its first annual report on the performance of its EV Program, and along with the other Massachusetts EDCs, a proposed statewide program evaluation plan for MDPU approval and stakeholder input. On September 30, 2024, the MDPU stamp approved the Joint Statewide Electric Vehicle Program Evaluation Plan.

MW of offshore wind by June 30, 2027. Under Section 83D of the Act, the EDCs are required to jointly seek proposals for cost-effective clean energy (hydroelectric, solar and land-based wind) long-term contracts via one or more staggered solicitations for a total of megawatt-hours (MWh) by December 31, 2022. Fitchburg s pro rata share of these contracts is approximately 1 . The EDCs issued the RFP for Section 83D Long-Term Contracts in March 2017, and power purchase agreements (PPAs) for MWh of hydroelectric generation and associated environmental attributes from Hydro-Quebec Energy Services (U.S.), Inc. were filed in July 2018 for approval by the MDPU. On June 25, 2019, the MDPU approved the PPAs, including the EDCs proposal to sell the energy procured under the contract into the ISO-NE wholesale market and to credit or charge the difference between the contract costs and the ISO-NE market revenue to customers. The MDPU also approved the EDCs request for remuneration equal to of the contract payments, as well as the EDCs proposal to recover costs associated with the contracts. On January 13, 2023, NECEC Transmission LLC (NECEC), the company with which Fitchburg and the other EDCs entered into transmission service

MW of offshore wind energy generation, for approval by the MDPU. On April 12, 2019, the MDPU approved the offshore wind energy generation PPAs, including the EDCs proposal to sell the energy procured under the contract into the ISO-NE wholesale market and to credit or charge the difference between the contract costs and the ISO-NE market revenue to customers. The EDCs issued a second RFP pursuant to Section 83C to procure an additional MW of offshore wind energy generation in May 2019. The EDCs filed for approval of two PPAs with Mayflower Wind Energy LLC (now known as SouthCoast Wind), each for MW of offshore wind energy generation, on February 10, 2020. On November 5, 2020, the MDPU approved the PPAs. In both cases, the MDPU approved the EDCs request for remuneration equal to of the contract payments, as well as the EDCs proposal to recover costs associated with the contracts. In April 2023, SouthCoast Wind engaged with the EDCs to explore options to mitigate impacts of global resource constraints and pricing challenges associated with the PPAs from this procurement. They cited an inability to finance the project within the terms set out in the PPA. The EDCs negotiated a termination agreement with SouthCoast Wind which was filed with the MDPU for approval on August 28, 2023 and which received approval on September 30, 2023. In accordance with An Act to Advance Clean Energy (2018) the DOER recommended that the EDCs solicit up to 1,600 MW in additional offshore wind in 2022 and 2024. On May 7, 2021, the EDCs issued a third RFP for up to an additional MW of off shore wind generation. On May 25, 2022, the EDCs sought approval of PPAs with Commonwealth Wind for MW and with SouthCoast Wind for MW. On December 16, 2022, Commonwealth Wind filed a motion requesting that the MDPU dismiss proceedings related to the approval of its contract, arguing that, due to various economic conditions, its contracts with the EDCs would no longer facilitate the financing of offshore wind energy generation. On December 30, 2022, the MDPU denied Commonwealth s motion and approved the PPAs. The MDPU also approved the EDCs request for remuneration equal to as reasonable and in the public interest. On January 19, 2023, Commonwealth Wind filed a Petition for Appeal with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) seeking to set aside and vacate the MDPU s Order approving the PPAs. In April 2023, SouthCoast Wind engaged with the EDCs to explore options to mitigate global resource constraints and pricing challenges associated with their PPAs from this procurement. SouthCoast Wind noted challenges around an inability to finance the projects under the current terms. The EDCs negotiated termination agreements with Commonwealth Wind and SouthCoast Wind and submitted the agreements to the MDPU for approval on July 13, 2023 and August 28, 2023, respectively. The MDPU approved both termination agreements on September 30, 2023. In connection with the termination agreements from the second and third solicitations, the Company received termination payments totaling million from Commonwealth Wind and SouthCoast Wind which is recorded as a regulatory liability on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets to be flowed back to customers. On October 12, 2023, Commonwealth Wind requested that the case with the SJC be entered as dismissed. Concurrently, Commonwealth Wind announced publicly they could not finance the project under the terms of the PPA. In 2021, the Massachusetts legislature increased the total solicitation target (including future solicitations) for offshore wind energy generation to MW by June 30, 2027. On August 30, 2023, the EDCs issued a fourth offshore wind RFP seeking to procure at least MW and up to the maximum amount remaining of the statutory requirement under Section 83C of MW of Offshore Wind Energy Generation, and taking into account offshore wind generation under contract at the time when proposals are due. Bidders are allowed to offer proposals of at least MW up to MW of offshore wind generation. On January 18, 2024, the EDCs notified the MDPU that they are extending the bid submission date and subsequent solicitation schedule dates by an additional 56 days each to allow bidders the opportunity to gain more certainty around their eligibility for the investment tax credit and factor it into their proposals. The submission date was revised to March 27, 2024. The EDCs received bids for Offshore Wind Generation from three developers and on September 6, 2024, the DOER selected a portfolio of projects totaling MW from three projects. The EDCs have commenced contract negotiations which are scheduled to be completed in November 2024. Unitil Energy/Northern Utilities - 2024-2026 Triennial Energy Efficiency Plan - New Hampshire - On November 30, 2023, the NHPUC approved the changes to New Hampshire s ratepayer-funded energy efficiency program offerings for the 2024 2026 period requested by New Hampshire s electric and gas utilities.

periods. The Environmental Obligations table includes amounts accrued for Northern Utilities related to estimated future cleanup costs associated with Northern Utilities environmental remediation obligations for former MGP sites. Corresponding Regulatory Assets were recorded to reflect that the future recovery of these environmental remediation costs is expected based on regulatory precedent and established practices. Fitchburg s Manufactured Gas Plant Site - Fitchburg has worked with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (Mass DEP) to address environmental concerns with the former MGP site at Sawyer Passway, and has substantially completed remediation activities, though on site monitoring continues. In April 2020, Fitchburg received notification from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (Mass DOT) that a portion of the site may be incorporated into the proposed Twin City Rail Trail with an anticipated commencement date in 2025. Depending upon the final agreement between Fitchburg and Mass DOT, additional minor costs are expected prior to completion. The Company is awaiting a decision regarding an Immediate Response Action (IRA) plan with three remediation alternatives, submitted to the MA DEP in October 2023, regarding contaminants in the sediment and riverbank of an abutting watercourse, and observed river seep. In anticipation of the DEP accepting one of the remediation alternatives, Fitchburg has accrued for estimated costs to complete the remediation at the Sawyer Passway site, which is included in Environmental Obligations on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has determined that the high end of the range of reasonably possible remediation costs for the Sawyer Passway site could be million based on remediation alternatives. Fitchburg anticipates the commencement of some remediation activities by the end of 2024, while the river seep will likely be addressed in 2025. Fitchburg recovers the environmental response costs incurred at this former MGP site in gas rates pursuant to the terms of a cost recovery agreement approved by the MDPU. Pursuant to this agreement, Fitchburg is authorized to amortize and recover environmental response costs from gas customers over succeeding seven-year periods. Unitil Energy - Kensington Distribution Operations Center - Unitil Energy conducted a Phase I and II environmental site assessment (ESA) in the second quarter of 2021 at its former distribution operations center in Kensington, NH. The Company is awaiting a decision on a report, submitted to the NH DES in June 2023, as to whether there is a need to conduct further investigation or remedial actions regarding the impacts of soil and groundwater contaminants identified in the ESA. Unitil Energy anticipates the commencement of remediation activities in either 2025 or 2026, depending upon the timing of the NH DES decision. The Company does not believe this investigation will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

If unused, the Company s state tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027. On April 14, 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15 that provides a safe harbor method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether to deduct or capitalize expenditures to repair, maintain, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property. Under the revenue procedure, the method of accounting will depend on the property s classification as linear transmission property, linear distribution property, or non-linear property. The revenue procedure may be adopted in tax years ending after May 1, 2023. The Company has elected a change in its tax accounting method on the 2023 consolidated tax return. A 481(a) adjustment was calculated and resulted in an additional million in tax expense on the 2023 consolidated tax return. In August 20 22, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA included new taxes on corporations, including the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and the Excise Tax on Repurchase of Corporate Stock. The AMT is equal to of a corporation s adjusted financial statement income (AFSI). The AMT applies to companies that have a year average AFSI of greater than billion. The IRA also extended and modified certain renewable energy related credits. The Company has evaluated the provisions and determined that they do not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements as of September 30, 2024. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which included a reduction to the corporate federal income tax rate to effective January 1, 2018, was signed into law. In accordance with FASB Codification Topic 740, the Company revalued its Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes (ADIT) at the new tax rate at which the ADIT will be reversed in future periods. Based on communications received by the Company from its state regulators in rate cases and other regulatory proceedings in the first quarter of 2018 and as prescribed in the TCJA, FERC guidance and IRS normalization rules, the benefit of protected excess ADIT amounts will be subject to flow back to customers in future utility rates according to the Average Rate Assumption Method (ARAM). ARAM reconciles excess ADIT at the reversal rate of the underlying book/tax temporary timing differences. The Company estimates the ARAM flow back period for protected and unprotected excess ADIT to be between fifteen and twenty years over the remaining life of the related utility plant. Subject to regulatory approval, the Company expects to flow back to customers a net million of protected excess ADIT created as a result of the lowering of the statutory tax rate by the TCJA over periods estimated to be fifteen to 

41 

million to customers in its Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and federal jurisdictions.

 Supplemental Information; Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company's earnings discussion includes Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure referencing our 2024 GAAP Net Income less certain transaction costs related to the Company's acquisition of Bangor Natural Gas Company (Bangor), which it disclosed previously in 2024. The Company's management believes that the transaction costs related to the acquisition of Bangor, which are included in Operation and Maintenance expense on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, are not indicative of the Company's ongoing costs and not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business and therefore not an indicator of baseline operating performance. In the following tables the Company has reconciled Adjusted Net Income to GAAP Net Income, which we believe to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure.

The Company analyzes operating results using Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margins, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Electric Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated as Total Electric Operating Revenue less Cost of Electric Sales. Gas Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated as Total Gas Operating Revenues less Cost of Gas Sales. The Company s management believes Electric

Page 5 of 7 
 and Gas Adjusted Gross Margins are important financial measures to analyze revenue from the Company s ongoing operations because the approved cost of electric and gas sales are tracked, reconciled and passed through directly to customers in electric and gas tariff rates, resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in Total Electric and Gas Operating Revenue. In the following tables the Company has reconciled Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margin to GAAP Gross Margin, which we believe to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure. GAAP Gross Margin is calculated as Revenue less Cost of Sales, and Depreciation and Amortization. The Company calculates Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margin as Revenue less Cost of Sales. The Company believes excluding Depreciation and Amortization, which are period costs and not related to volumetric sales, is a meaningful measure to inform investors of the Company s profitability from electric and gas sales in the period.
