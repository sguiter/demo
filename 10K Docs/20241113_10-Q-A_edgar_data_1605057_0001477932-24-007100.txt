Basis of Presentation The following discussion highlights our results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of consolidated financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. Overview Vemanti, incorporated on April 3, 2014, under the laws of the State of Nevada, has pivoted away from a financial technology fintech focus to a technology company that will revolutionize the hospitality industry through digital innovation, seamlessly integrating new revenue streams without disrupting existing operations. It primarily seeks to generate revenues in the emerging markets of Vietnam and Southeast Asia. In particular, we aim to lead the sector's transformation by enhancing both guest experiences and operational efficiencies. Until June 16, 2022, we held an 18.6 ownership interest in Fvndit which, through its subsidiaries, operates an online short-term P2P financing platform for SMEs in Vietnam. On June 16, 2022, the Company executed and consummated the transactions contemplated by a stock purchase agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement entered into by and between the Company and Fvndit. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Fvndit purchased from the Company all of the shares of Fvndit s common stock then owned by the Company and certain accounts receivable of approximately 25,000 that were due from Fvndit to the Company in consideration for certain assets of Fvndit related to providing a peer-to-peer investment marketplace in Vietnam that matches companies needing working capital funds with investors wishing to provide those funds. As a result of the sale, the Company no longer owns any shares of Fvndit. On April 1, 2024, Vemanti entered into a share exchange agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement with VinHMS Pte. Ltd., a Singapore private company limited by shares VinHMS ), and Mr. Hoang Van Nguyen and Asian Star Trading Investment Pte. Ltd. Asian Star ), the sole shareholders of VinHMS (the Shareholders ), whereby Vemanti will acquire VinHMS for 20,000,000 through the issuance of 10,000,000 Preferred B Shares and the transfer of 40,000,000 Preferred A Shares from Mr. Tan Tran to Mr. Hoang Van Nguyen and Asian Star Trading Investment Pte. Ltd. Each Preferred B share can be converted into 26 Common shares after a 12-month lock-up agreement which was executed on April 1, 2024. As of today, no Preferred B shares have been converted. Any conversion can only be executed on or after April 1, 2025. As part of the transaction, Vemanti disposed of VoiceStep LLC thereby transferring it to Mr. Tan Tran. VinHMS Pte. Ltd. is now the only wholly owned subsidiary of Vemanti. - 5 - Table of Contents The Business Combination is being accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Vemanti, who is the legal acquirer, is being treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes and VinHMS is being treated as the accounting acquirer. This determination was primarily based on the following facts and circumstances: o VinHMS stockholders have 100 of the voting interests of the Preferred A shares; o VinHMS CEO has been named as the CEO of the Company; o the directors nominated by VinHMS represent the majority of the board of directors of the Company; o VinHMS is the larger entity, in terms of substantive operations and employee base; o VinHMS operations comprise the ongoing operations of the Company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination is being treated as the equivalent of a reverse recapitalization transaction in which VinHMS issued stock for the net assets of Vemanti. The net assets of Vemanti are being stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of VinHMS. VinHMS is a technology solutions provider specializing in digital transformation for the hospitality industry across Southeast Asia. VinHMS s native cloud-based platforms focus on reducing overall costs, streamlining processes, enhancing operational efficiency, accelerating new innovations, improving guest experiences, and increasing financial performance for hotel operators utilizing artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and proprietary advanced algorithms. In addition to its flagship hospitality management solution, CiHMS, VinHMS offers a suite of products, including asset management CiAMS ), theme park management CiTMS ), and a digital transformation solution for small hotels CiTravel ). For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized approximately 579,463 and 674,967, respectively, in net sales. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 172,113 and 243,749, respectively. As reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, we generated cash from operations of 125,558 and had a net profit from operations of 130,801 and an accumulated deficit of 246,094 as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2024. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that our cash position will be sufficient to support our daily operations. Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to continue to execute our operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance the necessary debt or equity financing will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to our Company. Accordingly, we may decide to exit our existing business and explore potential strategic alternatives, including establishing a new business, or target an existing business for acquisition, without restriction to any specific business, industry or geographical location.

As of June 30, 2024, there were no significant deferred tax assets, except for a net operating loss carryforward for which a 100 valuation allowance has been provided. Net Loss The Company incurred interest expense of 374,550, which led to a net loss of 243,749 for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Operating Profit Total operating profit was 48,719 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, largely driven by operating expenses exceeding gross profits. Net Loss As a result of the above factors plus 220,832 interest expense, we had a net loss of 172,113 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, our primary uses of cash have been to finance working capital needs. We expect that we will be able to meet our needs to fund operations, capital expenditures and other commitments in the next 12 months primarily with our cash balance and operating cash flows. However, the Company may choose to raise additional capital through a debt or equity financing in order to pursue additional acquisition or strategic investment opportunities. Additional capital, if required, may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. Currently, the Company has sufficient cash to remain in business for the next 12 months. The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated. For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 Net Cash provided by Operating Activities 125,558 Net Cash provided by Investing Activities 57,116 Net Cash used in Financing Activities (175,000 Cash at the beginning of the Period - Cash at the end of the Period 7,674 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operations was 125,558 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to slower than expected sales. Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was due to the effects of the reverse merger. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was to pay down debt to First Fire and Mr. Tan Tran. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks Not applicable. - 8 - Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Not applicable because we are a smaller reporting company. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not, in design and operation, effective at a reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. Because of our limited operations, we have a limited number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties. In addition, we lack a formal audit committee with a financial expert. As we grow and expand our operations, we will engage additional employees and experts as needed. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will expand. Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting. - 9 - Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently aware of any such proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
