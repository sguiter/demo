Origination Fees 

 Loan origination fees represent revenue
earned from originating mortgage loans; net of any credits given to the borrower. Loan origination fees generally represent flat, per-loan
fee amounts and are deferred and recognized as revenue over the life of the loan. The associated loan origination costs are also deferred
and recognized as expense over the life of the loan. The deferred portion of the loan origination fees is netted against the deferred
portion of the loan origination costs, which include mortgage broker expenses, and reported as a net deferred revenue liability on the
Company s unaudited consolidated statements of financial condition. 

Servicing Fees 

 Loan servicing fees represent revenue
earned for servicing loans for various investors. Loan servicing fees are a percentage of the outstanding unpaid principal balance and
represent the difference between the interest received from our CM Loans and the MSN interest payable. Servicing fees are recognized as
revenue as the related mortgage payments are received; similarly, loan servicing expenses are charged to operations as incurred. 

Underwriting Income 

 Underwriting income represents revenue
earned by J.W. Korth for underwriting and distribution of the Company s securities. Revenues from underwriting income are recognized
on the settlement date of the trades.

MSN noteholders in accordance with the terms of their MSN Notes.

Each share was sold for and is convertible into common stock at a ratio of 5 shares of common stock for each share of Series A Preferred
Stock. On September 15, 2021, June 28, 2022, and March 23, 2023, the Company sold an additional , , and shares,
respectively, of its Series A 6 Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock for net proceeds of , , and . 

On August 12, 2022, the Company repurchased

of . The Company paid in interest expense. 

On June 29, 2021, the Company issued
 shares of its Series B 6.50 Cumulative Non-Voting Redeemable Secured Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of 
per share, for net proceeds of . The Company paid in expenses related to the preferred stock issuance to its financial
advisor and placement agent. 

The Series B preferred stock is non-convertible
and pays cumulative dividends, if and when declared by the Company s Board of Directors, at a rate of per annum. Dividends
declared will be payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year. The Series B preferred
stock ranks senior to KDM s common stock and Series A 6 Cumulative Preferred Stock in dividend rights and upon liquidation, winding
up or dissolution, and will rank pari passu with, or senior to, all future issuances of preferred stock of KDM. 

The Company is required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization, or NRSRO, rating for so long as any shares of
Series B preferred stock remain outstanding. If the Company fails to maintain an NRSRO rating for the Series B preferred stock of at least
BBB (or the equivalent thereof), the dividend rate applicable to the Series B preferred stock will be increased by 25 basis points, and
in the event the Company fails to maintain an NRSRO rating of at least BBB- (or the equivalent thereof), the dividend rate applicable
to the Series B preferred stock will be increased by an additional 25 basis points. The Company s current corporate rating is BBB. 

The Series B preferred stock is redeemable
at the Company s option, in whole or in part, on or after June 29, 2026, at a redemption price per share equal to per share,
plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any. Subject to applicable law, the Company is required to redeem the Series B preferred stock,
in each case at a redemption price equal to 1,000 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, as follows: 

10 of the originally-issued shares of Series
B preferred stock on June 29, 2027; 

10 of the originally-issued shares of Series
B preferred stock on June 29, 2028; 

10 of the originally-issued shares of Series
B preferred stock on June 29, 2029; 

20 of the originally-issued shares of Series
B preferred stock on June 29, 2030; and 

50 of the originally-issued shares of Series
B preferred stock on June 29, 2031. 

The Company s obligations to
redeem the Series B preferred stock are secured by a security interest on servicing fees, as specified in each mortgage secured note issued
by the Company, which is the difference between the interest payable pursuant to the mortgage secured note and the interest receivable
pursuant to the related commercial real estate mortgage loan. The requisite holders of Series B preferred stock will be entitled to exercise
rights and remedies pursuant to such security interest in the event that the Company does not pay the relevant mandatory redemption price
(inclusive of any accrued and unpaid dividends) within thirty (30) days of the applicable redemption date, except with respect to the
final redemption date, which is not subject to a thirty (30)-day grace period. 

Level III Inputs
reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. 

ASC 820 requires the use of observable
market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of
the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant
to the fair value measurements. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs. 

Valuation Process 

Mortgages
Owned and Mortgage Secured Notes Payable: 

 Mortgage loans
for which the Company has the intention and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, are reported at their
outstanding principal balances, net of any unearned income, premiums or discounts. If a decline in fair value below the carrying balance
is other-than-temporary, an unrealized impairment loss is recorded, and the loan is recorded at the lower fair value at each reporting
period. 

On March 5, 2024, through a full credit
bid in the foreclosure auction, KDM, via its subsidiary KDM Nagog Park LLC, took ownership of the office property securing KDM2021-N015.
In April 2024, via a deed in lieu of foreclosure, a wholly owned subsidiary of KDM named KDM Cupples REO LLC took title to the office
property securing KDM2021-N022. Both loans went into default in late 2023 due to the departure of major tenants. As of September 30, 2024,
it was determined that the value of these two mortgages were impaired and recorded on the Statement of Operations in the amount of .
The foreclosed properties in the amount of are included in the property and equipment. The carrying value of the properties
was determined by third party appraisals near the time of acquisition. 

Due to the fact that the Company issues
notes secured directly by underlying loans, our assets and liabilities in this category have similar values and assets have offsetting
balances. 

Mortgage Servicing: 

 The net present value of the servicing
income is recognized at the time the mortgage is initiated as an unrealized gain, which is being recognized through net income at each
reporting period This value uses several inputs that are highly subjective including: discount rate, constant prepayment rate, the current
interest rate environment, and default rate assumptions. Since the Company has limited operating history and a small amount of loans outstanding,
it has a limited basis to predict prepayment rates and default rates, but have engaged a third party, MIAC Analytics, to assist us in
our valuation of this asset. The amount is included on the unaudited consolidated statements of financial condition as Mortgage
Servicing Rights, at Fair Value. 

Securities 

 J. W. Korth owns , par of
defaulted Banco Cruzeiro del Sur bonds. As of September 30, 2024, the value of these bonds was , which management believes to be
the fair value expected to be received from the receiver handling the liquidation of the company in Brazil. Local counsel has informed
us that the bank has sufficient cash to pay off the fair value of our bonds. We have received payment of to date. 

KDM also holds a small amount of its
own MSNs in an account in which it will hold MSNs it may buy from time to time to provide liquidity to clients of J.W. Korth. These bonds
are carried at the published statement values.

Overview 

Korth Direct Mortgage Inc. KDM, 
the Company, we, or us began operations in October of 2016. We were founded by J. W. Korth

We are licensed in Florida as a Mortgage Lender
Servicer. Our NMLS License Number is 1579547. 

We originate, fund and service loans which are
made to commercial borrowers. The loans are held by KDM as the lender. We fund our loans in a variety of ways, including directly in the
capital markets through issuance of Mortgage Secured Notes MSNs or Notes ), which are sold through J.W. Korth
as underwriter or placement agent through exemptions from registration available under Rule 144A, Regulation D, and other exemptions from
registration. We also fund loans via loan participations and direct investments as well as on our warehouse line. 

In July of 2022, we created an additional subsidiary
to issue our MSNs, KDM Funding I LLC KDMF ). KDMF solely issues the Notes and does not have any other operations and there
are no stand-alone financial statements prepared for KDMF. KDM is the servicer of the loans. The revenue and expenses associated with
the Note issuance and the underlying loans are consolidated into the Company s consolidated results of operations. However, when
reporting on deal level information, we will break out the deals by issuer. 

KDM has a number of special purpose entities that
it manages including KDM Capital Management LLC, KDM Capital Partners LP, KDM Funding I LLC, KDM Stafford LLC, KDM Nagog Park, LLC, KDM
Cupples REO, LLC, KDM Asset Management, LLC, and a wholly owned subsidiary named Citrus Servicing LLC which services the loans in our
small balance multifamily program.

months ended September 30, 2024, compared with gross profit of 4,809,038 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase

for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 549,337,262 as of December 31, 2023. The decline in Total Assets of 20,949,475 is
due primarily to 30,687,205 decrease in mortgages owned due to two loans completing foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and being

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company closed on a 100,000,000 financing
repurchase facility on October 13, 2023. From time to time, we may need additional haircut capital to use the repurchase facility, which
we may fund in a variety of ways, on either a short or long-term basis. Haircut capital is the cash on hand necessary to fund the portion
of the loan not funded by the Line. The Company generates servicing revenues on its Mortgages owned with maturity dates ranging from October
2024 to June 2037 as well as income from its investments and portfolio loans with maturity dates ranging from December 2024 to July 2028. 

We anticipate raising additional capital to fund
our lending and development in the coming months. Additionally, we are actively raising capital in KDM Capital Partners LP the
Fund ). 

Status of KDM Loans 

As of September 30, 2024, there were 3 CM Loans
in payment default, and two loans that were foreclosed upon that still have MSNs outstanding. The Company has a creative office/flex space
in the process of foreclosure where the owner has declared bankruptcy, and an owner occupied property that is behind on payments and we
are working with them to get them back in compliance. 

 We had a special purpose property pool that had
filed an Assignment for Benefit of Creditors. That property was sold and we were able to pay off the MSN s at 89.53 . 

KDM extended KDM2020-N012 for an additional 5
years at a reduced rate that will take effect in October 2025. There are several other loans that were scheduled to mature between June
2024 to January 2025 that are being extended. Please see Subsequent Events . 

Item

We have no material positions subject to market
risk. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as such item is defined by Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a - 15(f). Our internal controls
are designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance

Internal control over financial reporting has
inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes
in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.

of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2024, as required by Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a- 15(c). In making our assessment, we have utilized
the criteria set forth by the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway

2024.
