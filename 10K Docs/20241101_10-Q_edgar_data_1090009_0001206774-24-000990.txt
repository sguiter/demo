SOUTHERN FIRST BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The Company is subject to the regulations of various
governmental agencies. These regulations can and do change significantly from period to period. The Company also undergoes periodic examinations
by the regulatory agencies, which may subject the Company to changes with respect to the valuation of assets, the amount of required credit
loss allowance and operating restrictions resulting from the regulators judgments based on information available to them at the
time of their examinations. 

 The Bank makes loans to individuals and businesses
in the Upstate, Midlands, and Lowcountry regions of South Carolina as well as the Triangle, Triad and Charlotte regions of North Carolina
and Atlanta, Georgia for various personal and commercial purposes. The Bank s loan portfolio has a concentration of real estate
loans. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, real estate loans represented and , respectively, of total loans. However, borrowers 
ability to repay their loans is not dependent upon any specific economic sector. 

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s and the
Bank s capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements. While management believes that we have sufficient capital to
withstand an extended economic recession, our reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by future credit losses. 

 The Company maintains access to multiple sources of
liquidity, including a million holding company line of credit with another bank which could be used to support capital ratios at
the subsidiary bank. As of September 30, 2024, the million line was unused.

Total investment securities 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had individual
investments that were in an unrealized loss position. The unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates,
rather than deterioration in credit quality. The individual securities are each investment grade securities. The Company considers factors
such as the financial condition of the issuer including credit ratings and specific events affecting the operations of the issuer, volatility
of the security, underlying assets that collateralize the debt security, and other industry and macroeconomic conditions. The Company
does not intend to sell these securities, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities
before recovery of the amortized cost. The issuers of these securities continue to make timely principal
and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. As such, there is no allowance
for credit losses on available for sale securities recognized as of September 30, 2024 . 

Other investments are comprised of the following and
are recorded at cost which approximates fair value.

and determined that the other investments are not impaired as of September 30, 2024 and that ultimate recoverability of the par value
of the investments is probable. All of the FHLB stock is used to collateralize advances with the FHLB. 

 At September 30, 2024, there were no securities pledged

Credit Quality Indicators 

 The Company tracks credit quality based on its internal
risk ratings. Upon origination, a loan is assigned an initial risk grade, which is generally based on several factors such as the borrower s
credit score, the loan-to-value ratio, the debt-to-income ratio, etc. After loans are initially graded, they are monitored regularly for
credit quality based on many factors, such as payment history, the borrower s financial status, and changes in collateral value.
Loans can be downgraded or upgraded depending on management s evaluation of these factors. Internal risk-grading policies are consistent
throughout each loan type. 

 A description of the general characteristics of the
risk grades is as follows: 

Pass A pass loan ranges from minimal to
average credit risk; however, still has acceptable credit risk. 

Watch A watch loan exhibits above average
credit risk due to minor weaknesses and warrants closer scrutiny by management. 

Special mention A special mention loan has
potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration
of the repayment prospects for the loan or the institution s credit position at some future date. 

Substandard A substandard loan is inadequately
protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must
have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. A substandard loan is characterized by
the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful A doubtful loan has all of the
weaknesses inherent in one classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation
in full, on the basis of the currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

The following table presents loan balances classified by credit quality
indicators by year of origination as of September 30, 2024.

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial
Difficulty 

 The
Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt
Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures ASU 2022-02 effective January 1, 2023. The amendments in ASU 2022-02 eliminated
the recognition and measure of troubled debt restructurings and enhanced disclosures for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing
financial difficulty. 

 The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate
of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate
of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty. The Company uses a probability of default/loss given default model to determine the allowance for credit
losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. 

 Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses due to the measurement methodologies used to
estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Loan modifications to
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30,
2023. 

 Allowance for Credit Losses 

 The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses
to provide for expected credit losses. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the principal is uncollectable.
Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Allocations of the allowance are made for specific loans and for pools of
similar types of loans, although the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management s judgment, should be charged
against the allowance. A provision for credit losses is taken based on management s ongoing evaluation of the appropriate allowance
balance. 

 A formal evaluation of the adequacy
of the credit loss allowance is conducted quarterly. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the
adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of historical
default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio,
adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay a loan, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition
of the loan portfolio, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations.
Management believes the level of the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb all 

expected future losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet
date. The allowance is increased through provision for credit losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously
charged-off. 

 The Company uses a lifetime probability of default
and loss given default modeling approach to estimate the allowance for credit losses on loans. This method uses historical correlations
between default experience and the age of loans to forecast defaults and losses, assuming that a loan in a pool shares similar risk characteristics
such as loan product type, risk rating and loan age, and demonstrates similar default characteristics as other loans in that pool, as
the loan progresses through its lifecycle. The Company calculates lifetime probability of default and loss given default rates based on
historical loss experience, which is used to calculate expected losses based on the pool s loss rate and the age of loans in the
pool. Management believes that the Company s historical loss experience provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit
losses to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Company uses its own internal data to measure historical credit loss experience
within the pools with similar risk characteristics over an economic cycle. The probability of default and loss given default method also
includes assumptions of observed migration over the lifetime of the underlying loan data. Loans that do not share risk characteristics
are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. 

 Management also considers further adjustments to historical
loss information for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that differ from the conditions that exist for the period
over which historical information is evaluated as well as other changes in qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative
analyses. The Company generally utilizes a four-quarter forecast period in evaluating the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable
forecast scenarios which are incorporated through qualitative adjustments. There is immediate reversion to historical loss rates. The
qualitative categories and the measurements used to quantify the risks within each of these categories are subjectively selected by management
but measured by objective measurements period over period. The data for each measurement may be obtained from internal or external sources.
The current period measurements are evaluated and assigned a factor commensurate with the current level of risk relative to past measurements
over time. The resulting qualitative adjustments are applied to the relevant collectively evaluated loan pools. These adjustments are
based upon quarterly trend assessments in certain economic factors such as labor, inflation, consumer sentiment and real disposable income,
as well as associate retention and turnover, portfolio concentrations, and growth characteristics. The qualitative analysis increases
or decreases the allowance allocation for each loan pool based on the assessment of factors described above.

 Collateral dependent loans are
loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower
is experiencing financial difficulty. The Company reviews individually evaluated loans for designation as collateral dependent loans,
as well as other loans that management of the Company designates as having higher risk. These loans do not share common risk characteristics
and are not included within the collectively evaluated loans for determining the allowance for credit losses. 

Under CECL, for collateral dependent loans, the Company
has adopted the practical expedient to measure the allowance for credit losses based on the fair value of collateral. The allowance for
credit losses is calculated on an individual loan basis based on the shortfall between the fair value of the loan's collateral, which
is adjusted for liquidation costs/discounts, and amortized cost. If the fair value of the collateral exceeds the amortized cost, no allowance
is required. 

 The following tables present an analysis of collateral-dependent
loans of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Level 1 Quoted market price in active markets 

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
 or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include certain debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market. 

Level 2 Significant other observable inputs 

Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as
 quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or
 can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities
 include fixed income securities and mortgage-backed securities that are held in the Company s available-for-sale portfolio and valued
 by a third-party pricing service, as well as certain individually evaluated loans. 

Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs 

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. These methodologies may result in a significant portion of the fair value being derived from unobservable data. 

The methods of determining the fair value of assets
and liabilities presented in this note are consistent with our methodologies disclosed in Note 12 of the Company s 2023 Annual Report
on Form 10-K. See Note 5 for how the derivative asset fair value is determined. The Company s loan portfolio is initially fair valued
using a segmented approach, using the eight categories of loans as disclosed in Note 4 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses.
Loans are considered a Level 3 classification.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 Financial instruments require
disclosure of fair value information, whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets, when it is practical to estimate
the fair value. A financial instrument is defined as cash, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity or a contractual obligation
which requires the exchange of cash. Certain items are specifically excluded from the disclosure requirements, including the Company s
common stock, premises and equipment and other assets and liabilities.

.0 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
 The Company had lease liabilities, included in other liabilities, of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively. We maintain operating leases on land and buildings for various office spaces. The lease agreements have
maturity dates ranging from April 2025 to February 2032, some of which include options for multiple five-year extensions. The weighted
average remaining life of the lease term for these leases was years as of September 30, 2024. The ROU asset and lease liability
are recognized at lease commencement by calculating the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The ROU assets also
include any initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made at or before commencement date and are reduced by any lease incentives. 

 The discount rate used in determining the lease liability
for each individual lease was the FHLB fixed advance rate which corresponded with the remaining lease term at implementation of the accounting
standard and as of the lease commencement date for leases subsequently entered into. The weighted average discount rate for leases was as
of September 30, 2024. 

 The total operating lease costs were

 OVERVIEW 

 Our business model continues to be client-focused,
utilizing relationship teams to provide our clients with a specific banker contact and support team responsible for all of their banking
needs. The purpose of this structure is to provide a consistent and superior level of professional service, and we believe it provides
us with a distinct competitive advantage. We consider exceptional client service to be a critical part of our culture, which we refer
to as "ClientFIRST." 

 At September 30, 2024, we had total assets of 4.17
billion, a 2.9 increase from total assets of 4.06 billion at December 31, 2023. The largest component of our total assets is loans which
were 3.62 billion and 3.60 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our liabilities and shareholders 
equity at September 30, 2024 totaled 3.85 billion and 326.5 million, respectively, compared to liabilities of 3.74 billion and shareholders 
equity of 312.5 million at December 31, 2023. The principal component of our liabilities is deposits which were 3.52 billion and 3.38
billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

 Like most community banks, we derive the majority of
our income from interest received on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is
our deposits, on which we pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or
the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing
liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets
and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, which is called our net interest spread. In addition to earning interest on our
loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other charges to our clients. 

 Our net income to common shareholders
was 4.4 million and 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per share EPS was 0.54 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 0.51 for the same period in 2023. The increase in net income was primarily driven
by an increase in 

29 

 Table of Contents 

net interest income resulting from additional interest income on our loan portfolio combined with an increase in noninterest
income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expenses. 

 Our net income to common shareholders was 9.9 million
and 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Diluted EPS was 1.22 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.15 for the same period in 2023. The increase in net income was primarily driven by the additional
interest income on our interest-earning assets.

 Net Interest Income and Margin 

 Our level of net interest income is determined by the
level of earning assets and the management of our net interest margin. Our net interest income was 20.6 million for the third quarter
of 2024, a 6.4 increase over net interest income of 19.3 million for the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by a 3.7 million increase
in interest income on our interest-earning assets, partially offset by a 2.5 million increase in interest expense. In addition, our net
interest margin, on a tax-equivalent (TE) basis, was 2.08 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.97 for the same period in 2023. 

 We have included a number of tables to assist in our
description of various measures of our financial performance. For example, the Average Balances, Income and Expenses, Yields and
Rates table reflects the average balance of each category of our assets and liabilities as well as the yield we earned or the rate
we paid with respect to each category during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. A review of this table
shows that our loans typically provide higher interest yields than do other types of interest-earning assets, which is why we direct a
substantial percentage of our earning assets into our loan portfolio. Similarly, the Rate/Volume Analysis tables demonstrate
the effect of changing interest rates and changing volume of assets and liabilities on our financial condition during the periods shown.
We also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates, and we have included tables
to illustrate our interest rate sensitivity with respect to interest-earning accounts and interest-bearing accounts. 

 The following tables entitled Average Balances,
Income and Expenses, Yield and Rates set forth information related to our average balance sheets, average yields on assets, and
average costs of liabilities. We derived these yields by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets
or liabilities. We derived average balances from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated. During the same periods, we had
no securities purchased with agreements to resell. All investments owned have an original maturity of over one year. Nonaccrual loans
are included in the following tables. Loan yields have been reduced to reflect the negative impact on our earnings of loans on nonaccrual
status. The net of capitalized loan costs and fees are amortized into interest income on loans.

Our net interest margin (TE) increased 11 basis points
to 2.08 during the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to an increase in our interest-earning
assets, as well as an increase in the yield on our interest-earning assets. Our average interest-earning assets grew by 40.1 million
during the third quarter of 2024 from the prior year, while the average yield on these assets increased by 34 basis points to 5.18 . Our
average interest-bearing liabilities grew by 29.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 from the prior year, while the rate on these
liabilities increased 30 basis points to 4.02 . 

 The increase in average interest-earning assets for
the third quarter of 2024 related primarily to an increase of 74.6 million in our average loan balances from the prior year, partially
offset by a 23.6 million decrease in average federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks. The 34 basis point increase
in yield on our interest-earning assets was driven by a 35 basis point increase in loan yield and a 24 basis point increase in yield on
federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks. 

 The increase in our average interest-bearing liabilities
during the third quarter of 2024 resulted primarily from a 53.1 million increase in our interest-bearing deposits from the prior year,
while the 30 basis point increase in rate on our interest-bearing liabilities was driven by a 31 basis point increase in deposit rates. 

 Our net interest spread was
1.16 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.12 for the same period in 2023. The net interest spread is the difference between
the yield we earn on our interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. The 34 basis point increase
in yield on our interest-earning assets was partially offset by a 30 basis point increase in the rate on our interest-bearing liabilities,
resulting in a 4 basis point increase in our net interest spread for the 2024 period. We anticipate continued pressure on our net interest
spread and net

During the first nine months of 2024, our net interest
margin (TE) decreased by 12 basis points to 2.00 , compared to 2.12 for the first nine months of 2023, driven by the increase in yield
on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our average interest-bearing liabilities grew by 259.1 million from the prior year, with the average
yield increasing by 66 basis points to 4.02 . In contrast, our average interest-earning assets grew by 222.6 million, while the rate
on these assets increased 47 basis points to 5.11 . 

 The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities
for the first nine months of 2024 was driven by an increase in interest-bearing deposits of 159.0 million and a 100.1 million increase
in FHLB advances and other borrowings, while the increase in cost was driven by a 71 basis point increase on our interest-bearing deposits. 

 The increase in average interest-earning assets for
the first nine months of 2024 related primarily to a 165.0 million increase in our average loan balances and a 33.2 million increase
in average federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks. The increase in yield on our interest-earning assets was driven
by a 47 basis point increase in the yield on federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks and a 46 basis point increase
in our loan yield. 

 Our net interest spread was
1.09 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1.28 for the same period in 2023. The 19 basis point decrease in our net interest
spread was driven by the 66 basis point increase in yield on our interest-bearing liabilities.

Net interest income, the largest component of our income,
was 20.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 19.3 million for the third quarter of 2023, a 1.2 million, or 6.4 , increase year
over year. The increase during 2024 was driven by a 3.7 million increase in interest income primarily due to higher yields on our loan
portfolio and an increase in average loan balances. Partially offsetting the increase in interest income was a 2.5 million increase in
interest expense which was primarily driven by higher rates on our interest-bearing deposits.

Net interest
income for the first nine months of 2024 was 58.8 million compared to 58.6 million for 2023, a 169,000, or 0.29 , increase. The increase
in net interest income during 2024 was driven by a 21.6 million increase in interest income, offset by a 21.4 million increase in interest
expense. 

 Provision for Credit Losses 

 The provision for credit losses,
which includes a provision for losses on unfunded commitments, is a charge to earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses and
reserve for unfunded commitments at levels consistent with management s assessment of expected losses in the loan portfolio at
the balance sheet date. We review the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Please see the discussion included
in Note 4 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses for a description of the factors we consider in determining the amount of the
provision we expense each period to maintain this allowance. 

33 

 Table of Contents 

We did not record a provision for credit losses during
the third quarter of 2024, compared to a reversal of 500,000 to the provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2023. We recorded
a provision expense of 325,000 and 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. No
provision was recorded in the third quarter of 2024 due to low charge-offs and insignificant loan growth. The reversal of 500,000 in
the third quarter of 2023, included a 100,000 reversal of provision for credit losses and a 400,000 reversal for unfunded commitments.
The reversal of the provision for credit losses was driven by lower expected loss rates, while the reversal of the reserve for unfunded
commitments was driven by a decrease in the balance of unfunded commitments at September 30, 2023, compared to the previous quarter and
year. The 325,000 provision expense for the first nine months of 2024 included 750,000 provision for credit losses and a 425,000 reversal
for unfunded commitments. The 2.2 million provision expense for the first nine months of 2023 included a 2.9 million provision for credit
losses and a 615,000 reversal for unfunded commitments.

Noninterest income was 3.2 million for the third quarter
of 2024, a 425,000, or 15.5 , increase from noninterest income of 2.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. Mortgage banking income
continues to be the largest component of our noninterest income at 1.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 241,000,
or 20.0 , over the prior year. The increase was driven by higher mortgage volume during the third quarter of 2024. Service fees on deposit
accounts increased 99,000, or 27.8 , over the prior year. The increase was driven by fee income on our commercial credit cards and additional
wire fee income. 

 Noninterest income was 9.4 million for the first nine
months of 2024, a 1.8 million, or 24.4 , increase from noninterest income of 7.5 million for the first nine months of 2023. Mortgage
banking income increased by 1.4 million, or 43.2 , over the prior year while service fees on deposit accounts increased 254,000, or
25.1 , from the first nine months of 2023.

Noninterest expense was 18.0
million for the third quarter of 2024, a 737,000, or 4.3 , increase from noninterest expense of 17.3 million for the third quarter
of 2023. The increase in noninterest expense was driven primarily by the following: 

34 

 Table of Contents 

Compensation and benefits expense increased 558,000,
or 5.5 , relating primarily to an increase in salaries, equity compensation expenses, and other employee benefits expenses. 

Outside service and data processing costs increased
 186,000, or 10.7 , relating primarily to increases in software licensing and maintenance costs. 

Noninterest expense was 54.8 million for the first
nine months of 2024, a 3.0 million, or 5.8 , increase from noninterest expense of 51.8 million for the first nine months of 2023. The
increase in noninterest expense was driven primarily by the following: 

Compensation and benefits expense increased 2.1
million, or 6.7 , relating primarily to annual salary increases, bonuses, and equity compensation expenses. 

Outside service and data processing costs increased
 660,000, or 13.0 , relating primarily to increases in item processing, electronic banking and software licensing and maintenance costs. 

Occupancy costs increased 167,000, or 2.2 , primarily
due to depreciation on the Dream Mortgage Center which opened in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Insurance costs increased 116,000, or 4.1 , as
a result of higher FDIC insurance premiums. 

Partially offsetting these increases, professional
fees decreased 166,000, or 8.7 , relating primarily to decreases in loan appraisal fees, legal fees and other consulting fees. 

 Our efficiency ratio was 75.9 for the third quarter
of 2024, compared to 78.3 for the third quarter of 2023. The efficiency ratio represents the percentage of one dollar of expense required
to be incurred to earn a full dollar of revenue and is computed by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and
noninterest income. The improvement during the 2024 period is due to the higher level of net interest income recorded. 

 We incurred income tax expense of 1.3 million and
 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 3.1 million and 2.8 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 23.9 and 23.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. The higher tax rate during the first nine months of 2024 was driven by the effect of equity compensation transactions
during the period. 

 Balance Sheet Review 

 Investment Securities 

 At September 30, 2024, the 154.2 million in our investment
securities portfolio represented approximately 3.7 of our total assets. Our available for sale investment portfolio included corporate
bonds, US treasuries, US government agency securities, state and political subdivisions, asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities
with a fair value of 134.6 million and an amortized cost of 146.1 million, resulting in an unrealized loss of 11.5 million. At December
31, 2023, the 154.6 million in our investment securities portfolio represented approximately 3.8 of our total assets, including investment
securities with a fair value of 134.7 million and an amortized cost of 149.1 million for an unrealized loss of 14.4 million. In addition,
other investments, which include FHLB Stock and other nonmarketable investments, decreased 299,000 from December 31, 2023 to 19.6 million
at September 30, 2024. 

 Loans 

 Since loans typically provide higher interest yields
than other types of interest earning assets, a substantial percentage of our earning assets are invested in our loan portfolio. Average
loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3.62 billion and 3.46 billion,
respectively. Before the allowance for credit losses, total loans outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 3.62 billion
and 3.60 billion, respectively. 

 The principal component of our
loan portfolio is loans secured by real estate mortgages. As of September 30, 2024, our loan portfolio included 3.05 billion, or 84.4 ,
of real estate loans, compared to 3.05 billion, or 84.8 , at December 31, 2023. Most of our real estate loans are secured by residential
or commercial property. We obtain a security interest in real estate, in addition to any other available collateral, in order to increase
the likelihood of the 

35 

 Table of Contents 

ultimate repayment of the loan. Generally, we limit the loan-to-value ratio on loans to coincide with the appropriate regulatory guidelines.
We attempt to maintain a relatively diversified loan portfolio to help reduce the risk inherent in concentration in certain types of collateral
and business types. Home equity lines of credit totaled 195.4 million as of September 30, 2024, of which approximately 45 were in a
first lien position, while the remaining balance was second liens. At December 31, 2023, our home equity lines of credit totaled 183.0
million, of which approximately 46 were in first lien positions, while the remaining balance was in second liens. The average home equity
loan had a balance of approximately 89,000 and a loan to value of 73 as of September 30, 2024, compared to an average loan balance of
 85,000 and a loan to value of approximately 73 as of December 31, 2023. Further, 0.3 and 0.8 of our total home equity lines of credit
were over 30 days past due as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

 Following is a summary of our loan composition at September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, our loan portfolio increased by 16.9 million, or 0.47 , primarily
driven by a 15.5 million increase in consumer loans secured by real estate. Our consumer real estate portfolio
grew by 49.9 million and includes high quality 1-4 family consumer real estate loans. Our average consumer real estate loan currently
has a principal balance of 470,000, a term of 23 years, and an average rate of 4.33 as of September 30, 2024, compared to a principal
balance of 469,000, a term of 23 years, and an average rate of 4.10 as of December 31, 2023.

Nonperforming assets 

 Nonperforming assets include
real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed taken in lieu of foreclosure and loans on nonaccrual status. Generally, a loan is placed
on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days past due 

36 

 Table of Contents 

as to principal or interest, or when we believe, after considering economic and business conditions and collection
efforts, that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of the contractual principal or interest on the loan is
doubtful. A payment of interest on a loan that is classified as nonaccrual is recognized as a reduction in principal when received. Our
policy with respect to nonperforming loans requires the borrower to make a minimum of six consecutive payments in accordance with the
loan terms and to show capacity to continue performing into the future before that loan can be placed back on accrual status. As of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no loans 90 days past due and still accruing.

At September 30, 2024, nonperforming assets were 11.6
million, or 0.28 of total assets and 0.32 of gross loans. Comparatively, nonperforming assets were 4.0 million, or 0.10 of total assets
and 0.11 of gross loans at December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual loans increased 7.6 million during the first nine months of 2024 due primarily
to two relationships totaling 6.9 million that went on nonaccrual during the second quarter. The amount of foregone interest income on
nonaccrual loans in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 134,000 and 48,000, respectively. 

 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance
for credit losses represented 346.78 and 1,026.58 of the total amount of nonperforming loans, respectively. A significant portion of
the nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024 were secured by real estate. We have evaluated the underlying collateral on these loans
and believe that the collateral on these loans is sufficient to minimize future losses. 

 As a general practice, most of our commercial loans
and a portion of our consumer loans are originated with relatively short maturities of less than ten years. As a result, when a loan reaches
its maturity we frequently renew the loan and thus extend its maturity using similar credit standards as those used when the loan was
first originated. Due to these loan practices, we may, at times, renew loans which are classified as nonaccrual after evaluating the loan s
collateral value and financial strength of its guarantors. Nonaccrual loans are renewed at terms generally consistent with the ultimate
source of repayment and rarely at reduced rates. In these cases, we will generally seek additional credit enhancements, such as additional
collateral or additional guarantees to further protect the loan. When a loan is no longer performing in accordance with its stated terms,
we will typically seek performance under the guarantee. 

 In addition, at September 30, 2024, 84.4 of our loans
were collateralized by real estate and 98.8 of our individually evaluated loans were secured by real estate. We utilize third party appraisers
to determine the fair value of collateral dependent loans. Our current loan and appraisal policies require us to obtain updated appraisals
on an annual basis, either through a new external appraisal or an appraisal evaluation. Individually evaluated loans are reviewed on a
quarterly basis to determine the level of impairment. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any individually evaluated real estate
loans carried at a value in excess of the appraised value. We typically charge-off a portion or create a specific reserve for individually
evaluated loans when we do not expect repayment to occur as agreed upon under the original terms of the loan agreement. 

 At September 30, 2024, individually evaluated loans
totaled 12.4 million with a reserve of approximately 1.6 million allocated in the allowance for credit losses. Comparatively, individually
evaluated loans totaled 4.8 million at December 31, 2023 for which 3.7 million of these loans had a reserve of approximately 688,000
allocated in the allowance for credit losses. 

37 

 Table of Contents 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

 The allowance for credit losses was 40.2 million,
representing 1.11 of outstanding loans and providing coverage of 346.78 of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024 compared to 40.7
million, or 1.13 of outstanding loans and 1,026.55 of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2023, the allowance
for credit losses was 41.1 million, or 1.16 of outstanding loans and 953.25 of nonperforming loans. 

 Deposits and Other Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

 Our primary source of funds for loans and investments
is our deposits and advances from the FHLB. In the past, we have chosen to obtain a portion of our certificates of deposits from areas
outside of our market in order to obtain longer term deposits than are readily available in our local market. Our internal guidelines
regarding the use of brokered CDs limit our brokered CDs to 30 of total deposits, which allows us to take advantage of the attractive
terms that wholesale funding can offer while mitigating the related inherent risk. 

 Our retail deposits represented 2.93 billion, or 83.3 
of total deposits, while our wholesale deposits represented 588.5 million, or 16.7 , of total deposits at September 30, 2024. At December
31, 2023, retail deposits represented 3.00 billion, or 88.8 , of our total deposits and wholesale deposits were 379.4 million, representing
11.2 of our total deposits. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 103 at September 30, 2024 and 107 at December 31, 2023.

Our primary focus is on increasing core deposits, which
exclude out-of-market deposits and time deposits of 250,000 or more, in order to provide a relatively stable funding source for our loan
portfolio and other earning assets. While our non-interest bearing deposits increased by 15.6 million from 674.2 million at December
31, 2023, our core deposits decreased to 2.71 billion from 2.81 billion at December 31, 2023. In addition, at September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, we estimate that we have approximately 1.3 billion, or 36.3 and 38.7 of total deposits, respectively, in uninsured
deposits, including related interest accrued and unpaid. Since it is not reasonably practicable to provide a precise measure of uninsured
deposits, the amounts above are estimates and are based on the same methodologies and assumptions used by the FDIC for the Bank s
regulatory reporting requirements.

Time deposits that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance
limit of 250,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 813.4 million and 568.1 million, respectively. We have a relationship
with IntraFi Promontory Network, allowing us to provide deposit customers with access to aggregate FDIC insurance in amounts exceeding
 250,000. This gives us the ability, as and when needed, to attract and retain large deposits from insurance conscious customers. With
IntraFi, we have the option to keep deposits on balance sheet or sell them to other members of the network. 

 At September 30, 2024, we had 240.0 million of convertible
fixed rate FHLB advances with a weighted average rate of 3.74 , while at December 31, 2023, we had 275.0 million in FHLB Advances. Of
the 275.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2023, 35.0 million was at a variable rate and 240.0 million was at fixed rates. At September
30, 2024, the 240.0 million was secured with approximately 1.24 billion of mortgage loans and 14.5 million of stock in the FHLB. At
December 31, 2023, the 275.0 million was secured with approximately 1.25 billion of mortgage loans and 16.1 million of stock in the
FHLB.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is our ability to
fund operations, to meet depositor withdrawals, to provide for customers credit needs, and to meet maturing obligations and existing
commitments. Our liquidity principally depends on our cash flows from operating activities, investment in and maturity of assets, changes
in balances of deposits and borrowings, and our ability to borrow funds. The several large bank failures across the United States in
the first five months of 2023 exemplify the potential serious results of the unexpected inability of insured depository institutions
to obtain needed liquidity to satisfy deposit withdrawal requests, including how quickly such requests can accelerate once uninsured
depositors lose confidence in an institution s ability to satisfy its obligations to depositors. We seek to ensure our funding
needs are met by maintaining a level of liquidity through asset and liability management. Liquidity management involves monitoring our
sources and uses of funds in order to meet our day-to-day cash flow

requirements while maximizing profits. Liquidity management is made more complicated because different
balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control. For example, the timing of maturities of our investment
portfolio is fairly predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made. However, net deposit
inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to the same degree of control. 

 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cash
and cash equivalents totaled 260.6 million and 156.2 million, respectively, or 6.2 and 3.9 of total assets, respectively. Our investment
securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 amounted to 154.2 million and 154.6 million, respectively, or 3.7 and 3.8 of
total assets, respectively. Investment securities traditionally provide a secondary source of liquidity since they can be converted into
cash in a timely manner. 

 Our ability to maintain and expand our deposit base
and borrowing capabilities serves as our primary source of liquidity. We plan to meet our future cash needs through the liquidation of
temporary investments, the generation of deposits, loan payoffs, and from additional borrowings. In addition, we will receive cash upon
the maturity and sale of loans and the maturity of investment securities. We maintain six federal funds purchased lines of credit with
correspondent banks totaling 128.5 million for which there were no borrowings against the lines of credit at September 30, 2024. We also
had 172.8 million pledged and available with the Federal Reserve Discount Window at September 30, 2024. Comparatively, at December 31,
2023, we had 227.1 million pledged and available with the Federal Reserve Discount Window. At December 31, 2023, we had 13.0 million
of marketable investment securities pledged in the Federal Reserve s Bank Term Funding Program which closed on March 11, 2024. 

 We are also a member of the FHLB, from which applications
for borrowings can be made. The FHLB requires that securities, qualifying mortgage loans, and stock of the FHLB owned by the Bank be pledged
to secure any advances from the FHLB. The unused borrowing capacity currently available from the FHLB at September 30, 2024 was 716.7
million, based primarily on the Bank s qualifying mortgages available to secure any future borrowings. However, we are able to pledge
additional securities to the FHLB in order to increase our available borrowing capacity. In addition, at September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023 we had 276.5 million and 388.3 million, respectively, of letters of credit outstanding with the FHLB to secure client deposits. 

 We have a relationship with IntraFi Promontory Network,
allowing us to provide deposit customers with access to aggregate FDIC insurance in amounts exceeding 250,000. This gives us the ability,
as and when needed, to attract and retain large deposits from insurance conscious customers. With IntraFi, we have the option to keep
deposits on balance sheet or sell them to other members of the network. Additionally, subject to certain limits, the Bank can use IntraFi
to purchase cost-effective funding without collateralization and in lieu of generating funds through traditional brokered CDs or the FHLB.
In this manner, IntraFi can provide us with another funding option. Thus, it serves as a deposit-gathering tool and an additional liquidity
management tool. Under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, a well capitalized bank with a CAMELS rating
of 1 or 2 may hold reciprocal deposits up to the lesser of 20 of its total liabilities or 5 billion without those deposits being treated
as brokered deposits. 

 We also have a line of credit with another financial
institution for 15.0 million, which was unused at September 30, 2024. The line of credit was issued on December 28, 2023 at an interest
rate of the U.S. Prime Rate plus 0.25 and a maturity date of February 28, 2025. 

 On September 30, 2024, in conjunction with the semi-annual
interest payment, we redeemed 11.5 million of our outstanding subordinated debt. Beginning September 30, 2024, the interest rate shall
reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the Three-Month Term SOFR plus 340.8 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. 

 We believe that our existing
stable base of core deposits, federal funds purchased lines of credit with correspondent banks, availability with the Federal Reserve
Discount Window, and borrowings from the FHLB will enable us to successfully meet our long-term liquidity needs. However, as short-term
liquidity needs arise, we have the ability to sell a portion of our investment securities portfolio to meet those needs.

Total shareholders equity was 326.5 million
at September 30, 2024 and 312.5 million at December 31, 2023. The 14.1 million increase from December 31, 2023 is primarily related
to net income of 9.9 million during the first nine months of 2024, stock option exercises and equity compensation expenses of 1.9 million,
and a 2.3 million decrease in other comprehensive loss related to our available for sale securities. 

 The following table shows the return on average assets
(net income divided by average total assets), return on average equity (net income divided by average equity), equity to assets ratio
(average equity divided by average assets), and tangible common equity ratio (total equity less preferred stock divided by total assets)
annualized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. Since our inception, we have not paid cash
dividends.

Under the capital adequacy guidelines, regulatory capital
is classified into two tiers. These guidelines require an institution to maintain a certain level of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital to risk-weighted
assets. Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders equity, excluding the unrealized gain or loss on securities available for
sale, minus certain intangible assets. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet
assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0 to 100 based on the risks believed to be inherent in the type of asset. Tier 2 capital
consists of Tier 1 capital plus the general reserve for credit losses, subject to certain limitations. We are also required to maintain
capital at a minimum level based on total average assets, which is known as the Tier 1 leverage ratio. 

 Regulatory capital rules, which we refer to as Basel
III, impose minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The Basel III rules apply to all national and state banks
and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies other than small
bank holding companies, generally holding companies with consolidated assets of less than 3 billion. In order to avoid restrictions
on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a capital
conservation buffer on top of our minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of common equity Tier
1, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation
buffer consists of an additional amount of CET1 equal to 2.5 of risk-weighted assets. 

 To be considered well capitalized for
purposes of certain rules and prompt corrective action requirements, the Bank must maintain a minimum total risked-based capital ratio
of at least 10 , a total Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 , a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5 , and a leverage ratio
of at least 5 . As of September 30, 2024 our capital ratios exceed these ratios and we remain well capitalized. 

 The following table summarizes the capital amounts and ratios of the Bank
and the regulatory minimum requirements.

(1) The prompt corrective action provisions are only applicable at the
Bank level. The Bank exceeded the general minimum regulatory requirements to be considered well capitalized. 

The
ability of the Company to pay cash dividends to shareholders is dependent upon receiving cash in the form of dividends from the Bank.
The dividends that may be paid by the Bank to the Company are subject to legal limitations and regulatory capital requirements. Since
our inception, we have not paid cash dividends to shareholders.

Effect
of Inflation and Changing Prices 

 The effect of relative purchasing power over time due
to inflation has not been taken into account in our consolidated financial statements. Rather, our financial statements have been prepared
on an historical cost basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

 Unlike most industrial companies, our assets and liabilities
are primarily monetary in nature. Therefore, the effect of changes in interest rates will have a more significant impact on our performance
than will the effect of changing prices and inflation in general. In addition, interest rates may generally increase as the rate of inflation
increases, although not necessarily in the same magnitude. As discussed previously, we seek to manage the relationships between interest
sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide rate fluctuations, including those resulting from inflation. 

 Off-Balance Sheet Risk 

 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend
money to a client as long as the client has not violated any material condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have
fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. At September 30, 2024 unfunded commitments to
extend credit were 699.9 million, of which 76.3 million were at fixed rates and 623.6 million were at variable rates. At December 31,
2023, unfunded commitments to extend credit were 724.6 million, of which approximately 145.6 million were at fixed rates and 579.0
million were at variable rates. A significant portion of the unfunded commitments related to commercial business loans and consumer home
equity lines of credit. We evaluate each client s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained,
if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation of the borrower. The type of collateral varies but
may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and commercial and residential real estate. As of September
30, 2024, the reserve for unfunded commitments was 1.4 million or 0.20 of total unfunded commitments. As of December 31, 2023, the reserve
for unfunded commitments was 1.8 million or 0.25 of total unfunded commitments. 

 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there
were commitments under letters of credit for 13.6 million and 16.1 million, respectively. The credit risk and collateral involved in
issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Since most of the letters
of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon, they do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 

 Except as disclosed in this report, we are not involved
in off-balance sheet contractual relationships, unconsolidated related entities that have off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions
that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments that significantly impact earnings. 

 Critical Accounting Estimates 

 We have adopted various accounting policies that govern
the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and with general practices within the banking industry
in the preparation of our financial statements. 

 Certain accounting policies inherently involve a greater
reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be
materially different than originally reported, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities
and our results of operations. Of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements,
we have identified certain items as critical accounting policies based on the associated estimates, assumptions, judgments and complexity.
See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates 
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a description our significant accounting policies that use
critical accounting estimates.

Accounting, Reporting, and Regulatory
Matters 

 See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for details of recently issued
accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

 Other accounting standards that have been issued or
proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material
impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

 Market risk is the risk of
loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates, which principally arises from interest rate risk inherent in our lending,
investing, deposit gathering, and borrowing activities. Other types of market risks, such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and
commodity price risk, do not generally arise in the normal course of our business. 

 We actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk
exposure in order to control the mix and maturities of our assets and liabilities utilizing a process we call asset/liability management.
The essential purposes of asset/liability management are to seek to ensure adequate liquidity and to maintain an appropriate balance between
interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to minimize potentially adverse impacts on earnings from changes in market interest
rates. Our asset/liability management committee ALCO monitors and considers methods of managing exposure to interest rate
risk. We have both an internal ALCO consisting of senior management that meets no less than quarterly and a board risk committee that
meets quarterly. These committees are responsible for maintaining the level of interest rate sensitivity of our interest sensitive assets
and liabilities within board-approved limits. 

 As of September 30, 2024, the following table summarizes
the forecasted impact on net interest income using a base case scenario given upward and downward movements in interest rates of 100,
200, and 300 basis points based on forecasted assumptions of prepayment speeds, nominal interest rates and loan and deposit repricing
rates. Estimates are based on current economic conditions, historical interest rate cycles and other factors deemed to be relevant. However,
underlying assumptions may be impacted in future periods which were not known to management at the time of the issuance of the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Therefore, management s assumptions may or may not prove valid. No assurance can be given that changing economic
conditions and other relevant factors impacting our net interest income will not cause actual occurrences to differ from underlying assumptions.
In addition, this analysis does not consider any strategic changes to our balance sheet which management may consider as a result of changes
in market conditions.
