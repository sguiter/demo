in cash and cash equivalents, working capital deficit of and accumulated loss of . The Company believes that its
current level of cash is not sufficient to fund its operations and obligations without additional financing. 

The continuation of the Company as a going concern
through the next twelve months is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders and related parties. The Company
is currently pursuing additional financing for its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing
sufficient funds to sustain the operations for one year from the date of the filing of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements. 

These and other factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result
in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

White Label Solutions Revenue 

The Company derives revenue from the provision
of white label solutions. The Company offers white label, contracted licensed, solutions primarily to their information communications
technology ICT partners. The Company engages its ICT partners to utilize its Matchroom.net Platform. For customers who
have their own platforms and apps being used, the Company will customize the design of Matchroom.net to meet the customer s need
and integrate, a customized solution into the customer s system. The Matchroom.net platform and software solution is customizable
to the specific needs of each customer and can be integrated across multiple platforms. On average it will take the Company three months
to complete the customization of the platform for a customers use. 

The Company s typical arrangement involves
customizing the Matchroom.net platform solution, which requires technical programming support to build out the platform to its customers
specifications. As a result, in analyzing the performance obligations being provided to the customer the Company considers the software
license and customization services as a single performance obligation as required by ASC 606. In carrying out the services under these
arrangements, the Company is often provided with upfront payment which is deferred and recognized into revenue over the duration of the
contract. 

Esports Tournament Management and Team Services
Revenue 

The Company derives revenue from esports tournament
management and team services. The Company offers tournament management services to their customers, whereby they are engaged to provide
the service of managing and hosting a tournament of the customer s choice. The Company provides the required manpower and skills
to host and manage an esports tournament on their own Matchroom.net platform or on the platform of the customer. The hosting and management
of these tournaments on behalf of the customer is deemed to be one performance obligation and is met over the period of performance (couple
of days) in which the tournament is held. 

The amount to be recognized as revenue equals
the predetermined event management fee as per the agreement in place between the Company and the customer. The Company fulfills its performance
obligation through the execution and completion of hosting the tournament, over the period of performance that being the multi-day tournament.
The amount per the contract is based on the needs of the customer and the required level of manpower or skills needed for the relevant
tournament. 

Apart from hosting the tournaments of other customers,
the Company also hosts and managed their own internally held tournaments. The Company will obtain sponsorship agreements with other third-party
entities whereby the Company commits to deliver certain sponsor and promotional services in exchange for consideration. Upon completion
of the tournament a work completion report will be generated and communicated to the customer. Revenue will be recording pro rata during
the duration of the tournament. The Company invoices its promotional partners based on the contracted services within the agreement.

maintaining a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in every jurisdiction that it is operating in. 

At September 30, 2024, the Company has U.S. federal

 TCJA in 2017, U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of , generated after 2017 have an indefinite
carryforward period. U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, in the amount of , generated prior to 2018 will expire, if unused,
beginning in 2034. State net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if unused, in 2034. 

At September 30, 2024, the Company s subsidiary
operating in Malaysia has net operating loss of approximately million. Net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if
unused, in 2025. 

At September 30, 2024, the Company s subsidiary
operating in Bangladesh has net operating loss carryforwards of which can be carried forward for a maximum period of six years. 

The Company follows the provision of ASC 740 which
prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain
tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The Company did not have any unrecognized tax positions or
benefits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax
benefits as a component of income tax expense. We do not expect any material changes in our unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12
months. 

The Company s ability to utilize U.S. net
operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be deferred or limited significantly if the Company were to experience
an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions
of state law. In general, an ownership change occurs when the ownership of the Company s stock by 5 percent or more shareholders
 5-percent shareholders exceeds 50 percentage points within a three-year period. We have not conducted a Section 382 study
to determine whether the use of our U.S. net operating losses is limited. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past, and we
may experience ownership changes in the future, some of which are outside our control. This could limit the amount of net operating losses
that we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities.

ITEM 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Disclaimer Regarding Forward Looking Statements 

Our Management s Discussion and Analysis
or Plan of Operations contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking
statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general
economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make
and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations
and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers
or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business
disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed
from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Although the forward-looking statements in this
Quarterly Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known
by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and
outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review
and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of
the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects. 

Company Overview 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are set forth in Item 1 of this report. 

The Company operates within the Esports industry
and derives revenue from esports tournament management and team services. The Company offers tournament management services to their customers,
whereby they are engaged to provide the service of managing and hosting a tournament of the customer s choice. The Company provides
the required manpower and skills to host and manage an esports tournament on their own Matchroom.net platform or on the platform of the
customer. Apart from hosting the tournaments of other customers, the Company also hosts and managed their own internally held tournaments.
The Company will obtain sponsorship agreements with other third-party entities whereby the Company commits to deliver certain sponsor
and promotional services in exchange for consideration. 

Going concern 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company has determined that certain factors
raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a least one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 13,804
in cash and cash equivalents, working capital deficit of 4,345,409 and accumulated deficit of 12,563,494. The Company believes that
its current level of cash are not sufficient to fund its operations and obligations without additional financing. 

25 

The continuation of the Company as a going concern
through the next twelve months is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders and related parties. The Company
is currently pursuing additional financing for its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing
sufficient funds to sustain the operations for one year from the date of the filing of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements. 

These and other factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result
in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern. 

Overview and Outlook 

The following comparative analysis on results
of operations was based primarily on the comparative unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, footnotes and related information
for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and
the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report.

Revenue increased to 158,727 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, from 34,288 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue is mainly attributed by
our white label project entered with Smart Communications, Inc., a large telecommunication provider in the Philippines and revenue of

Cost of revenue decreased to 117,897
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 155,313 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue
is due to the over-provision of the rental of platform server cost, network bandwidth cost, and direct labor costs incurred during the
period. 

General and administrative expenses decreased
to 81,033 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 194,264 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in
general and administrative expenses is mainly attributable from the decrease in exhibition expenses, salaries and wages, and travelling
expense for the expansion of business. 

Net loss decreased to 40,529 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, from 307,372 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss is mainly attributed from

expense for the expansion of business. 

Net profit (loss) increased to 49,798 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, from net loss of (1,129,024) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net
loss is mainly attributed from the decrease in general and administrative expenses and increase in revenue. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash
equivalents of 13,804, accounts receivable of 321,647, deposit and other receivables of 34,931. Such cash amount and other sources
of liquidity are not sufficient to support our operation in the next twelve months. The Company is currently pursuing additional financing
for its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations.
In the absence of such financing, our business will likely fail.

that are indexed to our own shares and classified as shareholders equity, or that are not reflected in our condensed consolidated
financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity
that serves as credit, liquidity, or market risk support to such entity. Moreover, we do not have any variable interest in an unconsolidated
entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development
services with us. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact amounts reported therein.
On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates. These estimates are based on management s historical industry experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

For a description of
the accounting policies that, in management s opinion, involve the most significant application of judgment or involve complex estimation
and which could, if different judgment or estimates were made, materially affect our reported financial position, results of operations,
or cash flows, see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well
as Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our accounting policies and estimates to our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

ITEM 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the
information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4 Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 and there
have been no changes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

29 

Remediation Plan 

Management
has implemented remediation steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we are expanding and remediating
our review process for revenue related transactions and contracts with our customers and ASC 606. We plan to further improve this process
by enhancing access to accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting
applications and consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in the Company's internal
control over financial reporting during the last quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected, and therefore
