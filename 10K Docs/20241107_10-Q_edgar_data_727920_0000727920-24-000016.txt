Words such as expects, believes, anticipates, intends, seeks, aims, plans, assumes, estimates, projects, should, would, could, may, will, shall or variations of such words are generally part of forward-looking statements.

We, us and our refer to Equitable Financial and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context refers only to Equitable Financial as a corporate entity. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting Equitable Financial will be those anticipated by management. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, all matters that are not historical facts. 
 These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and there are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including, among others: (i) conditions in the financial markets and economy, including the impact of geopolitical conflicts and related economic conditions, equity market declines and volatility, interest rate fluctuations, impacts on our goodwill and changes in liquidity and access to and cost of capital; (ii) operational factors, indebtedness, protection of confidential customer information or proprietary business information, operational failures by us or our service providers, potential strategic transactions, changes in accounting standards, and catastrophic events, such as the outbreak of pandemic diseases including COVID-19; (iii) credit, counterparties and investments, including counterparty default on derivative contracts, failure of financial institutions, defaults by third parties and affiliates and economic downturns, defaults and other events adversely affecting our investments; (iv) our reinsurance and hedging programs; (v) our products, structure and product distribution, including variable annuity guaranteed benefits features within certain of our products, variations in statutory capital requirements, financial strength and claims-paying ratings and key product distribution relationships; (vi) estimates, assumptions and valuations, including risk management policies and procedures, potential inadequacy of reserves and experience differing from pricing expectations or reserves, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and financial models; (vii) recruitment and retention of key employees at Equitable Financial and experienced and productive financial professionals; (viii) subjectivity of the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments; (ix) legal and regulatory risks, including federal and state legislation affecting financial institutions, insurance regulation and tax reform; and (x) general risks, including strong industry competition, information systems failing or being compromised and protecting our intellectual property.

Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as otherwise may be required by law. 
 Other risks, uncertainties and factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make. Readers should read carefully the factors described in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K to better understand the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business and underlying any forward-looking statements.

 billion and billion, respectively related to these VIEs. 
 Non-Consolidated VIEs 
 billion and billion of investment assets in the form of equity interests issued by non-corporate legal entities determined under the guidance to be VIEs, such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies, including CLOs, hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate-related funds. As an equity investor, the Company is considered to have a variable interest in each of these VIEs as a result of its participation in the risks and/or rewards these funds were designed to create by their defined portfolio objectives and strategies. Primarily through qualitative assessment, including consideration of related party interests or other financial arrangements, if any, the Company was not identified as the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs, largely due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Consequently, the Company continues to reflect these equity interests in the consolidated balance sheets as other equity investments and applies the equity method of accounting for these positions. The net assets of these non-consolidated VIEs are approximately billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s maximum exposure to loss from its direct involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of its investment of billion and billion and approximately billion and billion of unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company has no further economic interest in these VIEs in the form of guarantees, derivatives, credit enhancements or similar instruments and obligations.

 The Company maintains a diversified portfolio of corporate securities across industries and issuers and does not have exposure to any single issuer in excess of of total corporate securities. The largest exposures to a single issuer of corporate securities held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were million and million, respectively, representing and of the total consolidated equity of the Company. 
 Corporate high yield securities, consisting primarily of public high yield bonds, are classified as other than investment grade by the various rating agencies, i.e., a rating below Baa3/BBB- or the NAIC designation of 3 (medium investment grade), 4 or 5 (below investment grade) or 6 (in or near default). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, approximately billion and billion, or and , of the billion and billion aggregate amortized cost of fixed maturities held by the Company were considered to be other than investment grade. These securities had gross unrealized losses of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the billion and billion of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were primarily concentrated in corporate securities. In accordance with the policy described in Note 2 of t he Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company concluded that an adjustment to the allowance for credit losses for these securities was not warranted at either September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not intend to sell the securities nor will it likely be required to dispose of the securities before the anticipated recovery of their remaining amortized cost basis. 
 Based on the Company s evaluation both qualitatively and quantitatively of the drivers of the decline in fair value of fixed maturity securities as of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that the unrealized loss was primarily due to increases in interest rates and credit spreads. 
 
 million and million. The agreements require a minimum of of the fair value of the loaned securities to be held as cash collateral, calculated daily. To further minimize the credit risks related to these programs, the financial condition of counterparties is monitored on a regular basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash collateral received in the amount of million and million was invested by the agent bank. A securities lending payable for the overnight and continuous loans is included in other liabilities in the amount of cash collateral received. Securities lending transactions are used to generate income. Income and expenses associated with these transactions are reported as net investment income and were not material for the September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The unrestricted cash collateral is reported in other invested assets. The Company posted collateral of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in the normal operation of its collateral arrangements. The Company is exposed to losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial derivative transactions with a positive fair value. The Company manages credit risk by: (i) entering into derivative transactions with highly rated major international financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties governed by master netting agreements, as applicable; (ii) trading through central clearing and OTC parties; (iii) obtaining collateral, such as cash and securities, when appropriate; and (iv) setting limits on single party credit exposures which are subject to periodic management review. 
 Substantially all of the Company s derivative agreements have zero thresholds which require daily full collateralization by the party in a liability position. In addition, certain of the Company s derivative agreements contain credit-risk related contingent features; if the credit rating of one of the parties to the derivative agreement is to fall below a certain level, the party with positive fair value could request termination at the then fair value or demand immediate full collateralization from the party whose credit rating fell and is in a net liability position. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there were no net liability derivative positions with counterparties with credit risk-related contingent features whose credit rating has fallen. All derivatives have been appropriately collateralized by the Company or the counterparty in accordance with the terms of the derivative agreements.

 Certain Privately Placed Debt Securities with Limited Trading Activity 
 Excluded from the tables above as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are approximately billion and million of Level 3 fair value measurements of investments for which the underlying quantitative inputs are not developed by the Company and are not readily available. These investments primarily consist of certain privately placed debt securities with limited trading activity, including residential mortgage- and asset-backed instruments, and their fair values generally reflect unadjusted prices obtained from independent valuation service providers and indicative, non-binding quotes obtained from third-party broker-dealers recognized as market participants. Significant increases or decreases in the fair value amounts received from these pricing sources may result in the Company reporting significantly higher or lower fair value measurements for these Level 3 investments.

 Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 
 Fair values for commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans on real estate are measured by discounting future contractual cash flows to be received on the mortgage loan using interest rates at which loans with similar characteristics and credit quality would be made. The discount rate is derived based on the appropriate U.S. Treasury rate with a like term to the remaining term of the loan to which a spread reflective of the risk premium associated with the specific loan is added. Fair values for mortgage loans anticipated to be foreclosed and problem mortgage loans are limited to the fair value of the underlying collateral, if lower. 
 Policy Loans 
 The fair value of policy loans is calculated by discounting expected cash flows based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve and historical loan repayment patterns. 
 Loans to Affiliates 
 The fair value of loans to affiliates is calculated by matrix or model pricing. The matrix pricing approach to fair value is a discounted cash flow methodology that incorporates market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment.

 million and above. A second putative class action was filed in the District of Arizona in 2017 and consolidated with the Brach matter in federal court in New York. The consolidated amended class action complaint alleged the following claims: breach of contract; misrepresentations in violation of Section 4226 of the New York Insurance Law; violations of New York General Business Law Section 349; and violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, and the California Elder Abuse Statute. Plaintiffs sought: (a) compensatory damages, costs, and, pre- and post-judgment interest; (b) with respect to their claim concerning Section 4226, a penalty in the amount of premiums paid by the plaintiffs and the putative class; and (c) injunctive relief and attorneys fees in connection with their statutory claims. In August 2020, the federal district court issued a decision certifying nationwide breach of contract and Section 4226 classes, and a New York State Section 349 class. Owners of a substantial number of policies opted out of the Brach class action. Most have settled pre-litigation, but a minority of opt-out policies are not yet the subject of litigation. Others filed suit previously, including pending individual federal actions that were coordinated with the Brach action and contained similar allegations. In May 2023, the Brach class action and Equitable Financial informed the federal district court that they had mutually agreed to settle the class action, and in October 2023, the federal district court entered an order of final approval of the settlement agreement. Equitable Financial is fully accrued for the class settlement, which will have no impact on earnings or distributable cash projections. In October 2023, Equitable Financial and the plaintiffs with individual federal actions coordinated with the Brach action informed the court that they had reached a settlement, and those actions were dismissed. Equitable Financial is likewise fully accrued for those individual settlements, which will have no impact on earnings or distributable cash projections. Equitable Financial has settled other actual and threatened litigations challenging the COI increase by individual policy owners and entities. 
 Finally, action is also pending against Equitable Financial in New York State Court. In July 2022, the trial court in Hobish v. AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company, granted in significant part Equitable Financial s motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiff s cross motion. That plaintiff appealed but the appellate court affirmed the trial court s decision. In March 2024, the intermediate appellate court granted plaintiff s motion for leave to appeal to the state s highest appellate court. Equitable Financial is vigorously defending each of these matters.

 FABN 
 Under the FABN program, Equitable Financial may issue funding agreements in U.S. dollar or foreign currencies to a Delaware special purpose statutory trust (the Trust in exchange for the proceeds from issuances of fixed and floating rate medium-term marketable notes issued by the Trust from time to time (the Trust Notes ). The funding agreements have matching interest, maturity and currency payment terms to the applicable Trust Notes. The Company hedges the foreign currency exposure of foreign currency denominated funding agreements using cross currency swaps as discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum aggregate principal amount of Trust Notes permitted to be outstanding at any one time is billion. Funding agreements issued to the Trust, including any foreign currency transaction adjustments, are reported in policyholders account balances in the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency transaction adjustments to policyholder s account balances are recognized in net income (loss) as an adjustment to interest credited to policyholders account balances and are offset in interest credited to policyholders account balances by a release of AOCI from deferred changes in fair value of designated and qualifying cross currency swap cash flow hedges.

 FABCP Program 
 In May 2023, the Company established a funding agreement-backed commercial paper program (the FABCP Program ), pursuant to which a special purpose limited liability company (the SPLLC may issue commercial paper and deposit the proceeds with the Company pursuant to a funding agreement issued by the Company to the SPLLC. The current maximum aggregate principal amount permitted to be outstanding at any one time under the FABCP Program is billion. The Company had million outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 Guarantees and Other Commitments 
 The Company provides certain guarantees or commitments to affiliates and others. As of September 30, 2024, these arrangements include commitments by the Company to provide equity financing of billion to certain limited partnerships and real estate joint ventures under certain conditions. Management believes the Company will not incur material losses as a result of these commitments. 
 The Company had million of undrawn letters of credit related to reinsurance as of September 30, 2024. The Company had million of commitments under existing mortgage loan agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company is the obligor under certain structured settlement agreements it had entered into with unaffiliated insurance companies and beneficiaries. To satisfy its obligations under these agreements, the Company owns single premium annuities issued by previously wholly-owned life insurance subsidiaries. The Company has directed payment under these annuities to be made directly to the beneficiaries under the structured settlement agreements. A contingent liability exists with respect to these agreements should the previously wholly-owned subsidiaries be unable to meet their obligations. Management believes the need for the Company to satisfy those obligations is remote.

The permitted practice was amended to also permit Equitable Financial to adopt SSAP 108 prospectively as of July 1, 2021 and to consider the impact of both the interest rate derivatives and the general account assets used to fully hedge the interest rate risk inherent in its variable annuity guarantees when determining the amount of the deferred asset or liability under SSAP 108. Application of the permitted practice partially mitigates the New York Insurance Regulation 213 Reg 213 impact of the Venerable Transaction on Equitable Financial s statutory capital and surplus and enables Equitable Financial to more effectively neutralize the impact of interest rates on its statutory surplus and to better align with our economic hedging program. The impact of applying this permitted practice relative to SSAP 108 as written was a decrease of approximately million in statutory special surplus funds as of September 30, 2024. The Reinsurance Treaty reduced the amount of interest rate hedging needed going forward, affecting future deferrals, but leaves our historical SSAP 108 deferred amounts unchanged. The permitted practice also reset Equitable Financial s unassigned surplus to as of June 30, 2021 to reflect the transformative nature of the Venerable Transaction. 
 The NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures manual NAIC SAP has been adopted as a component of prescribed or permitted practices by the State of New York. However, Reg 213 adopted in May of 2019 and as amended in February 2020 and March 2021, differs from the NAIC variable annuity reserve and capital framework. Reg 213 requires Equitable Financial to carry statutory basis reserves for its variable annuity contract obligations equal to the greater of those required under (i) the NAIC standard or (ii) a revised version of the NYDFS requirement in effect prior to the adoption of the first amendment for contracts issued prior to January 1, 2020, and for policies issued after that date a new standard that in current market conditions imposes more conservative reserving requirements for variable annuity contracts than the NAIC standard.

 million in statutory surplus as of September 30, 2024 compared to statutory surplus under the NAIC variable annuity framework. Our hedging program is designed to hedge the economics of our insurance liabilities and largely offsets Reg 213 and NAIC framework reserve movements due to interest rates and equities. The NYDFS allows domestic insurance companies a five year phase-in provision for Reg 213 reserves. As of September 30, 2022, Equitable Financial s Reg 213 reserves were phased-in. As of September 30, 2024, given the prevailing market conditions and business mix, there are million Reg 213 redundant reserves over the US RBC CTE 98 total asset requirement TAR ). 
 During the fourth quarter 2020, Equitable Financial received approval from NYDFS for its proposed amended Plan of Operation for Separate Account No. 68 SA 68 for our Structured Capital Strategies product and Separate Account No. 69 SA 69 for our EQUI-VEST product Structured Investment Option, to change the accounting basis of these two non-insulated Separate Accounts from fair value to book value in accordance with Section 1414 of the Insurance Law to align with how we manage and measure our overall general account asset portfolio. In order to facilitate this change and comply with Section 4240(a)(10), the Company also sought approval to amend the Plans to remove the requirement to comply with Section 4240(a)(5)(iii) and substitute it with a commitment to comply with Section 4240(a)(5)(i). Similarly, the Company updated the reserves section of each Plan to reflect the fact that Regulation 128 would no longer be applicable upon the change in accounting basis. We applied this change effective January 1, 2021. The impact of the application is an increase of approximately billion in statutory surplus as of September 30, 2024. 
 If the Company had not used all of the aforementioned prescribed and permitted practices that differ from NAIC SAP, a risk-based capital regulatory event would have hypothetically been triggered.

 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is presented pursuant to General Instruction (H)(2)(a) of Form 10-Q. The management s narrative that follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein, with the information provided under Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements and Information included elsewhere herein and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A in Part II, Item 7 and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A included in Equitable Financial s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ). The management s narrative that follows represents a discussion and analysis of Equitable Financial s financial condition and results of operations and not the financial condition and results of operations of Equitable Holdings, Inc. Holdings ). 
 
 Executive Summary 
 Overview 
 We are one of America s leading financial services companies, providing advice and solutions for helping Americans set and meet their retirement goals and protect and transfer their wealth across generations. We operate as a single segment entity based on the manner in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of resources. We benefit from our complementary mix of product offerings. This mix of product offerings provides diversity in our earnings sources, which helps offset fluctuations in market conditions and variability in business results, while offering growth opportunities. 
 Macroeconomic and Industry Trends 
 Our business and consolidated results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions and consumer confidence, conditions in the global capital markets and the interest rate environment. 
 Financial and Economic Environment 
 A wide variety of factors continue to impact financial and economic conditions. These factors include, among others, uncertainty regarding the federal debt limit, concerns regarding inflation, high fuel and energy costs, changes in fiscal or monetary policy and geopolitical tensions, including the U.S. presidential election. The Russian invasion of the Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war and broader Middle Eastern hostilities, including with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran, and the ensuing conflicts and the sanctions and other measures imposed in response to these conflicts significantly increased the level of volatility in the financial markets and have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty. 
 Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in the capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio. In addition, our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors, including equity market performance and interest rates. An increase in market volatility could continue to affect our business, including through effects on the yields we earn on invested assets, changes in required reserves and capital and fluctuations in the value of our AUM and AV, from which we derive our fee income. These effects could be exacerbated by uncertainty about future fiscal policy, changes in tax policy, the scope of potential deregulation and levels of global trade. 
 The potential for increased volatility could pressure sales and reduce demand for our products as consumers consider purchasing alternative products to meet their objectives. In addition, this environment could make it difficult to consistently develop products that are attractive to customers. Financial performance can be adversely affected by market volatility and equity market declines as fees driven by AV and AUM fluctuate, hedging costs increase and revenues decline due to reduced sales and increased outflows. U.S. equity markets showed strength in the third quarter of 2024, benefiting from a resilient U.S. economy with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics issuing a strong September 2024 jobs report that exceeded expectations, cooling inflation, and a widely held outlook for monetary easing, including a half-point interest rate reduction in September 2024, with additional, smaller rate cuts expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025 (based on statements of members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). 
 We will continue to monitor the behavior of our customers and other factors, including mortality rates, morbidity rates, annuitization rates and lapse and surrender rates, which change in response to changes in capital market conditions, to ensure that our products and solutions remain attractive and profitable. For additional information on our sensitivity to interest rates and capital market prices, see Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Conditions in the Financial Markets and Economy and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the Annual Report on the 2023 Form 10-K.

 Regulatory Developments 
 Insurance Regulation 
 Regulation of Investments 
 We are regulated primarily by the NYDFS, with some policies and products also subject to federal regulation. On an ongoing basis, regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards. Regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact our statutory reserve, capital requirements and profitability of the industry and result in increased regulation and oversight for the industry. 
 The NAIC is evaluating the risks associated with insurers investments in certain categories of structured securities, including CLOs. In March 2023, the NAIC adopted an amendment to the Purposes and Procedures Manual to give the NAIC s Structured Securities Group, housed within the SVO, responsibility for modeling CLO securities and evaluating tranche level losses across all debt and equity tranches under a series of calibrated and weighted collateral stress scenarios in order to assign NAIC designations. Under the amended Purposes and Procedures Manual, CLO investments will no longer be broadly exempt from filing with the SVO based on ratings from Credit Rating Providers. The NAIC s goal is to ensure that the weighted average RBC factor for owning all tranches of a CLO more closely aligns with what would be required for directly owning all of the underlying loan collateral, in order to avoid RBC arbitrage. In June 2024, the NAIC approved interim rules that raise capital requirements for holdings of CLO and other asset-backed security residual interests. The NAIC is also collaborating with interested parties to develop and refine the process for modeling CLO investments. In August 2024, the NAIC delayed a requirement for insurers to begin reporting the financially modeled NAIC designations for CLOs with their year-end 2024 financial statement filings to year-end 2025 to allow more time to develop the modeling methodology. 
 Fiduciary Rules 
 In 2023, the U.S. Department of Labor (the DOL proposed a regulation to change the definition of fiduciary for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA and parallel provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and proposed amendments to various existing prohibited transaction exemptions PTEs ), including PTE 84-14 that financial professionals rely on when they make investment recommendations to retirement investors. On April 23, 2024, the DOL finalized and published this new definition of fiduciary for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Code and finalized and published amendments to these PTEs (the new definition and the PTE amendments collectively, the Final Rule ). 
 Various industry groups brought litigation against the DOL seeking a variety of remedies for the Final Rule. On July 25, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the E.D. Tex. issued a stay of the effective date of portions of the Final Rule. On July 26, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the N.D. Tex. issued a stay of the effective date of the Final Rule as a whole. As a result of these court opinions, it is uncertain whether the Final Rule will become effective. 
 The DOL has appealed the stay issued in the E.D. Tex. litigation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The DOL has also filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the stay issued in the N.D. Tex. litigation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit; the parties have jointly agreed to stay further proceedings pending the outcome of the interlocutory appeal. 
 While this litigation proceeds, we are evaluating the potential impact of the Final Rule on our business, particularly as it pertains to the sale of insurance products to retirement investors. 
 For additional information on the regulatory developments and risk we face, see Business Regulation in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Risks in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues come from three principal sources: 
 fee income derived from our products; 
 premiums from our traditional life insurance and annuity products; and 
 investment income from our General Account investment portfolio. 
 81 

Table of Contents 

 Our fee income varies directly in relation to the amount of the underlying AV or benefit base of our life insurance and annuity products which are influenced by changes in economic conditions, primarily equity market returns, as well as net flows. Our premium income is driven by the growth in new policies written and the persistency of our in-force policies, both of which are influenced by a combination of factors, including our efforts to attract and retain customers and market conditions that influence demand for our products. Our investment income is driven by the yield on our General Account investment portfolio and is impacted by the prevailing level of interest rates as we reinvest cash associated with maturing investments and net flows to the portfolio. 
 Benefits and Other Deductions 
 Our primary expenses are: 
 policyholders benefits and interest credited to policyholders account balances; 
 sales commissions and compensation paid to intermediaries and advisors that distribute our products and services; and 
 compensation and benefits provided to our employees and other operating expenses. 
 Policyholders benefits are driven primarily by mortality, customer withdrawals and benefits which change in response to changes in capital market conditions. In addition, some of our policyholders benefits are directly tied to the AV and benefit base of our variable annuity products. Interest credited to policyholders varies in relation to the amount of the underlying AV or benefit base. Sales commissions and compensation paid to intermediaries and advisors vary in relation to premium and fee income generated from these sources, whereas compensation and benefits to our employees are more constant and impacted by market wages and decline with increases in efficiency. Our ability to manage these expenses across various economic cycles and products is critical to the profitability of our company. 
 Net Income Volatility 
 We have offered and continue to offer variable annuity products with GMxB features. The future claims exposure on these features is sensitive to movements in the equity markets and interest rates. Accordingly, we have implemented hedging and reinsurance programs designed to mitigate the economic exposure to us from these features due to equity market and interest rate movements. Changes in the values of the derivatives associated with these programs due to equity market and interest rate movements, together with the GMxB MRBs assets and liabilities are recognized in the periods in which they occur. This results in net income volatility as further described below. In addition, net income is impacted by changes in our reinsurers credit spread, while changes in the Company s credit spread is recorded in other comprehensive income OCI ). See Significant Factors Impacting Our Results Impact of Hedging and GMxB Reinsurance on Results. 
 In addition to our dynamic hedging strategy, we have static hedge positions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of changing market conditions on our statutory capital. We believe this program will continue to preserve the economic value of our variable annuity contracts and better protect our target variable annuity asset level. However, these static hedge positions increase the size of our derivative positions and may result in higher net income volatility on a period-over-period basis. 
 An additional source of net income (loss) volatility is the impact of the Company s annual actuarial assumption review. See Significant Factors Impacting Our Results Effect of Assumption Updates on Operating Results , for further detail of the impact of assumption updates on net income (loss). 
 
 Significant Factors Impacting Our Results 
 The following significant factors have impacted, and may in the future impact, our financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows. 
 Impact of Hedging and GMxB Reinsurance on Results 
 We have offered and continue to offer variable annuity products with GMxB features. The future claims exposure on these features is sensitive to movements in the equity markets and interest rates. Accordingly, we have implemented hedging and reinsurance programs designed to mitigate the economic exposure to us from these features due to equity market and interest rate movements. These programs include: 
 82 

Table of Contents 

 Variable annuity hedging programs . We use a dynamic hedging program (within this program, generally, we reevaluate our economic exposure at least daily and rebalance our hedge positions accordingly) to mitigate certain risks associated with the GMxB features that are embedded in our liabilities for our variable annuity products. This program utilizes various derivative instruments that are managed in an effort to reduce the economic impact of unfavorable changes in GMxB features exposures attributable to movements in the equity markets and interest rates. Although this program is designed to provide a measure of economic protection against the impact of adverse market conditions, it does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, changes in value of the derivatives will be recognized in the period in which they occur with offsetting changes in reserves partially recognized in the current period, resulting in net income volatility. In addition to our dynamic hedging program, we have a hedging program using static hedge positions (derivative positions intended to be held-to-maturity with less frequent re-balancing) to protect our statutory capital against stress scenarios. This program complements our dynamic hedge program and may result in net income volatility. 
 GMxB reinsurance contracts. Historically, GMxB reinsurance contracts were used to cede to affiliated and non-affiliated reinsurers a portion of our exposure to variable annuity products that offer a GMxB feature. We account for the reinsurance contracts as MRBs and report them at fair value. In addition, on June 1, 2021, we ceded the block comprised of non-New York Accumulator policies containing fixed rate GMIB and/or GMDB guarantees. On April 1, 2023, we ceded the remaining block of the living benefit and death riders related to its variable annuity contracts issued outside the State of New York prior to October 1, 2022 (and with respect to its EQUI-VEST variable annuity contracts issued outside the State of New York prior to February 1, 2023). 
 Effect of Assumption Updates on Operating Results 
 Our actuaries oversee the valuation of the product liabilities and assets and review the underlying inputs and assumptions. We comprehensively review the actuarial assumptions underlying these valuations and update assumptions during the third quarter of each year. Assumptions are based on a combination of Company experience, industry experience, management actions and expert judgment and reflect our best estimate as of the date of the applicable financial statements. Changes in assumptions can result in a significant change to the carrying value of product liabilities and assets and, consequently, the impact could be material to earnings in the period of the change. 
 Most of the variable annuity products, variable universal life insurance and universal life insurance products we offer maintain policyholder deposits that are reported as liabilities and classified within either Separate Accounts liabilities or policyholder account balances. Our products and riders also impact liabilities for future policyholder benefits, market risk benefits and unearned revenues and assets for DAC and DSI. The valuation of these assets and liabilities (other than deposits) is based on differing accounting methods depending on the product, each of which requires numerous assumptions and considerable judgment. The accounting guidance applied in the valuation of these assets and liabilities includes, but is not limited to, the following: (i) traditional life insurance products for which assumptions are updated annually to estimate the value of future death, morbidity or income benefits; (ii) universal life insurance and variable life insurance secondary guarantees for which benefit liabilities are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments; and (iii) certain product guarantees reported as market risk benefits at fair value. 
 For further details of our accounting policies and related judgments pertaining to assumption updates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Assumption Updates and Model Changes 
 We conduct our annual review of our assumptions and models during the third quarter of each year. We also update our assumptions as needed in the event we become aware of economic conditions or events that could require a change in assumptions that we believe may have a significant impact to the carrying value of product liabilities and assets and consequently materially impact our earnings in the period of the change. 
 Impact of Assumption Updates and Model Changes on Income from Continuing Operations before income taxes and Net income (loss) 
 The table below presents the impact of our actuarial assumption update to our income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes and net income (loss).

 2024 Assumption Updates 
 The impact of the economic assumption update during 2024 was a decrease of 19 million to income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes and a decrease to net income (loss) of 15 million. 
 The net impact of this assumption update on income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes of 19 million consisted of an increase in other income of 4 million, an increase in remeasurement of liability for future policy benefits of 25 million and a decrease in policyholders benefits of 2 million. 
 2023 Assumption Updates 
 The impact of the economic assumption update during 2023 was a decrease of 47 million to income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes and a decrease to net income (loss) of 37 million. 
 The net impact of this assumption update on income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes of 47 million consisted of a decrease in other income of 51 million, an increase in remeasurement of liability for future policy benefits of 36 million, an increase in policyholders benefits of 10 million, and a decrease in change in market risk benefits and purchased market risk benefits of 50 million. 
 Model Changes 
 There were no material model changes in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Our consolidated results of operations are significantly affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy because we offer market sensitive products. These products have been a significant driver of our results of operations. Because the future claims exposure on these products is sensitive to movements in the equity markets and interest rates, we have in place various hedging and reinsurance programs that are designed to mitigate the economic risk of movements in the equity markets and interest rates. The volatility in net income is primarily attributable to the mismatch between: (i) the change in carrying value of the MRBs; and (ii) our hedging and reinsurance programs.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Equitable Financial 
 Equitable Financial net income decreased 1.9 billion to a net loss of 675 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from net income of 1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The following were notable changes in net income (loss): 
 Unfavorable items included: 
 Net derivative losses increased by 2.0 billion due to higher equity market appreciation and gains attributed to funds withheld and modified coinsurance portfolios related to the Reinsurance Treaty. 
 85 

Table of Contents 

 Commissions increased by 224 million mainly due to higher distribution expenses from Equitable America s wholesale products, which are reimbursed by Equitable America in other income. 
 Compensation, benefits, interest and other operating expenses increased by 127 million mainly due to an increase in legal expenses. 
 Income tax benefit decreased by 479 million due to a partial release of the valuation allowance of 940 million on the deferred tax asset for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to no valuation allowance release in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by a pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 These were partially offset by the following favorable items: 
 Net investment losses decreased by 539 million mainly due to the program to reduce duration in 2023. 
 Policyholders benefits decreased by 296 million mainly due to favorable claims and the impact of the Reinsurance Treaty effective April 1, 2023. 
 See Significant Factors Impacting Our Results Effect of Assumption Updates on Operating Results for more information regarding the assumption update. 
 
 Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining: 
 market risk benefits and purchased market risk benefits; 
 accounting for reinsurance; 
 estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values and investment impairments; 
 estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation; 
 measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and 
 liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters. 
 In applying our accounting policies, we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries while others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Due to the material weakness described below, the Company s CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 As previously reported, the Company identified a material weakness in the design and operation of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. We did not timely design and implement effective controls over the Internal Reinsurance Treaty. Specifically, controls were not adequately designed or implemented to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the 
 86 

Table of Contents 

 recording of the transaction in accordance with the contractual terms of the Internal Reinsurance Treaty. We have concluded that the deficiency constituted a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting. 
 Remediation Status of Material Weakness 
 Management continues to execute its plan moving towards remediation of the material weakness. Since identifying the material weakness, management is in the process of designing and implementing new controls to capture the completeness and accuracy of the Internal Reinsurance Treaty contractual terms. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial processes and procedures have been in place for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. Accordingly, the material weakness is not remediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Other than as described above, with respect to ongoing remediation efforts, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
