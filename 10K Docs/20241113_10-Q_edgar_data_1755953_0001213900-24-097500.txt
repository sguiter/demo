connection with the Merger, on February 8, 2024, Akerna filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
(the Reverse Stock Split Amendment ). Because the Reverse Stock Split Amendment did not reduce the number of authorized shares
of common stock, the effect of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance relative
to the number of shares issued and outstanding. The Reverse Stock Split did not modify any voting rights or other terms of the common
stock. Eighty thousand and eight hundred and sixty-four ) fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.
Immediately after giving effect to the Merger and the Reverse Stock Split, the Company had shares of common stock
outstanding. On February 9, 2024, the common stock began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol GRYP. All

or services to a customer at a price that is significantly lower than the stand-alone selling price of the good or service. The mining
pool operator does not provide any discounts and as such there is no economic benefit to the customer and as such a separate performance
obligation does not exist under 606-10-55-42. In addition, there are no options for renewal that are separately identifiable from other

Fair value of Bitcoin 

The carrying basis (or cost basis) represents
the valuation of Bitcoin at the time the Company earns the Bitcoin through mining activities. 

The carrying amount for Bitcoin held as
of the adoption of ASC 350-60, was determined on the cost less impairment basis. 

The Company s Bitcoin holdings are not subject

Adoption of ASU 2023-08, Accounting for and
Disclosure of Crypto Assets 

Effective January 1, 2024, the Company early adopted
ASU 2023-08, which requires entities to measure crypto assets at fair value with changes recognized in the consolidated statement of operation
each reporting period. The Company s digital assets are within the scope of ASU 2023-08 and the transition guidance requires a cumulative-effect
adjustment as of the beginning of the current fiscal year for any difference between the carrying amount of the Company s digital
assets and fair value. As a result of the Company s early adoption of ASU 2023-08, the Company recorded a increase
in digital assets and a decrease in accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2024.

in the Company holding shares. 

The shares are accounted for in accordance with
ASC 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities, as such the shares will be classified as available-for-sale securities
and will be measured at each reporting period at fair value with the unrealized gain or (loss) as a component of other income (expense).

The Company evaluated the BTC Note in accordance

BTC Note) less (b) the sum of the Borrower s direct and indirect general and administrative expenses SG A in connection with Bitcoin mining operations, but not to exceed the greater of (x) and (y) the amount that is previously
preapproved by the Lender in writing for such calendar month; provided, however that, to the extent that SG A is capped by clause
(b) above, any unapplied SG A may be rolled forward to subsequent months until fully deducted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless
otherwise approved by Lender, the aggregate amount of SG A during any rolling twelve-month period shall not exceed , provided
that if at the end of a fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2023, if (x) the aggregate principal amount
payment received by the Lender for such fiscal quarter exceeds Bitcoin and (y) the average principal amount payment received
by the Lender for each fiscal quarter (commencing fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2023 and through and including the fiscal quarter for
which such determination is to be made) exceeds Bitcoin per fiscal quarter, then, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender 
of Net Monthly Mining Revenue (as defined in the Amendment) for the immediately succeeding fiscal quarter (and thereafter, in the following
fiscal quarter would shift to ). In the event that the Net Monthly Mining Revenue for any month is insufficient to cover interest
payment under the BTC Note, such deficiency shall be deemed paid-in-kind by capitalizing such deficiency in interest payment and adding

Collateral Coverage Ratio ).
A breach of the Collateral Coverage Ratio shall not be deemed to have occurred until the lender has provided notice to the Company of
such breach. If the Collateral Coverage Ratio decreases below , the Company will have to provide the lender with additional collateral
in the form of bitcoin, U.S. dollars, or additional equipment. If the Company is unable to do so, the Company may default on the BTC Note,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operations, financial condition, and results of operations. As of September
30, 2024, the Company was not in breach of the Collateral Coverage Ratio. 

The Amendment also added a conversion provision
whereby the lender has a limited right to convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal on the BTC Note into a number of shares
of the Company (the Conversion Right ). The Conversion Right is available at any time during the one-month period (the Conversion
Period after which the market capitalization of the Company for the first time exceeds for five consecutive days.
The conversion price is equal to divided by the number of shares of Company common stock outstanding immediately prior
to the lender s exercise of the Conversion Right during the Conversion Period. 

As consideration for the Amendment, the Company
agreed to make a one-time payment of bitcoins, which had a fair value of approximately on the date of
payment, therefore, reducing the principal balance of bitcoins from to , and a closing fee of , which
was offset with the adjustment for the change in fair value, as defined under debt modification accounting. 

The Company has evaluated the Amendment in accordance
with ASC 470-50 Modification and Extinguishments. The change in the interest rate from to caused there to be a significant
change in the cashflows of the BTC Note. Also, given that the BTC Note carried on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at
fair value, any gain on loss from the extinguishment would be adjusted through the change in fair value as of September 30, 2024. 

Also, based on the repayment terms and the interest
calculation, the Company is unable to determine what would be the current portion and long-term portions as of September 30, 2024, so
the Company will present the BTC Note as current. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company
recognized interest expense amounting to and , respectively, of which is still accrued. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized interest expense amounting to 159,00 and , respectively.

at the time, was
transferred to a wallet controlled by the threat actor. Via counsel, Gryphon engaged with US Federal law enforcement to recover the BTC. Despite
these attempts by law enforcement to recover the BTC, recovery was not possible. Gryphon subsequently wired the commensurate amount in
USD to Sphere 3D to make them whole for the stolen BTC. Gryphon also engaged a nationally recognized third-party firm to perform
a forensic analysis. The analysis revealed that the threat actor did not enter the email exchange via Gryphon s IT systems. Sphere
3D made a claim with its insurance carrier. If Sphere 3D is reimbursed by its insurance carrier, the Company would request reimbursement
from Sphere 3D. The Company has also subsequently modified its control systems to protect against any future attempted incursions.
As of March 31, 2023, the Company made the payment to Sphere 3D for , which was classified as a general and administrative expense
on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

On April 7, 2023, Sphere 3D filed suit against
Gryphon in the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit concerns the Sphere MSA between the parties where the Company agreed to act
as Sphere 3D s exclusive provider of any and all management services for all blockchain and cryptocurrency-related operations. 
Sphere 3D alleges that the Company has fallen short in its obligations under the Sphere MSA, and is suing for alleged breach of contract,
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty (such matter, the Sphere 3D Litigation ). 

On June 15, 2023, Sphere 3D filed an amended complaint
in connection with the Sphere 3D Litigation, which clarified certain of Sphere 3D s prior allegations. On June 28, 2023, the Company
requested leave to file a motion to dismiss Sphere 3D s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, which the Court granted on August 11, 2023. On August 18, 2023, the Company filed: (i) its motion to dismiss
Sphere 3D s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (ii) its
answer and counterclaims against Sphere 3D, asserting, among other things, that Sphere had breached the Sphere MSA, breached the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing in connection with that contract, acted negligently in connection with a separate incident, and
defamed the Company. The Company s answer and counterclaims further asserted the defamation counterclaim against Sphere 3D s
Chief Executive Officer, Patricia Trompeter, personally. 

On September 20, 2023, Sphere 3D filed a second
amended complaint in connection with the Sphere 3D Litigation, which added a claim against the Company alleging that the Company s
counterclaim for defamation against Sphere 3D violated New York s anti-SLAPP law. 

On October 6, 2023, Sphere 3D delivered a termination
notice to the Company with respect to the Sphere MSA, largely on the basis of the allegations made by Sphere 3D in the Sphere 3D Litigation
(the Sphere 3D MSA Termination ). On October 11, 2023, the Company filed an answer to Sphere 3D s second amended complaint,
in which, among other things, the Company alleged that Sphere 3D s attempted termination of the Sphere MSA was wrongful and ineffective,
because it violated the terms of the Sphere MSA, and thus that Sphere 3D continues to owe the Company all amounts to which it would otherwise
be entitled under the Sphere MSA through that contract s term ending in August 2026. 

Gryphon intends to continue to vigorously defend
against the Sphere 3D Litigation, including but not limited to the Sphere 3D MSA Termination, which it believes are without merit, and
to aggressively pursue its counterclaims against Sphere 3D. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or provide
an estimate of potential damages or recovery, if any. Failure by the Company to obtain a favorable resolution of the Sphere 3D Litigation
could require it to pay damage awards or otherwise enter into settlement arrangements for which its insurance coverage may be insufficient.
Any such damage awards or settlement arrangements in current or future litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, operating results or financial condition. Even if Sphere 3D s claims are not successful, or if the Company is successful
in pursuing its counterclaims or negotiating a favorable settlement, defending against this or future litigation is expensive and could
divert management s attention and resources, all of which could have an adverse and material impact on the Company s business,
operating results and financial condition and negatively affect the Company s value. Further, any valid termination of the Sphere
MSA in accordance with its terms could also have a negative impact on the Company s business and operating results. In addition,
such lawsuits may make it more difficult for the Company to finance its operations in the future. 

On March 15, 2024, the Company has collected all
outstanding balances associated with the direct pass-through of costs as well as management revenues billed through October 6, 2023 associated
with hosting Sphere 3D s miners at the Coinmint and Core facility previously held as Accounts Receivable as of December 31, 2023. 

During Q1 2024, the Company remitted all digital
assets held for other parties and restricted cash to Sphere 3D. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held approximately and bitcoin,
respectively, with a value of approximately 0 and , respectively, classified as digital assets held for other parties
on the balance sheet. Also, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held approximately 0 and , respectively
of cash generated from the sale of Sphere 3D BTC, to be used to make payments related to the Sphere MSA, classified as restricted cash
on the balance sheet.

Business Overview 

Founded in October 2020, Gryphon is a bitcoin
mining company based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Gryphon launched its mining operations in September 2021 upon the receipt of the first of 12
batches of 600 Bitmain S19j Pro Antminers. Gryphon s revenue model is to mine and hold bitcoin, and then sell only the bitcoin that
is necessary to pay its operating expenses and to reinvest in operational expansion. The bitcoin that is sold to pay operating expenses
and to reinvest in operational expansion is typically sold within 24-hours of receipt. 

Gryphon operates approximately 8,800 bitcoin ASIC
mining computers, referred to as miners, that Gryphon has installed at third-party hosted mining data centers located in
New York. Revenue generated by the mining of bitcoin is measured on a dollar per megawatt-hour MWh basis and is variable
based on the price of bitcoin, the measure of difficulty, transaction volume and global hash rates. 

Gryphon uses approximately 28 megawatts of space
at its primary hosting facility in New York, which relies on renewable hydro energy. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, Gryphon mined approximately 61 and 176 bitcoins, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Gryphon
mined approximately 287 and 575, respectively. While Gryphon does not have any plans to acquire digital assets other than bitcoin, it
may do so in the future.

The breakeven analysis is computed by taking the
cost of revenues for the given period and dividing that sum by the number of Bitcoin Equivalent Coins Generated during the same period.
For instance, in (Q3/24 the 3,612,000 cost of revenues is divided by the 61 Bitcoin Equivalent Coins Generated, resulting in an average
of 59,213 per coin). The BTC Equivalent calculation labeled as Total BTC Equiv in the table, is determined by combining
Gryphon s bitcoin-mined during the period with the bitcoin equivalent amount of revenue earned from the Sphere MSA. To calculate
the latter, the revenue earned from the Sphere MSA during the period is divided by the average bitcoin price as quoted by the Principal
Market for that same period (labeled as MSA BTC Equiv in the table). The breakeven analysis is an operational metric that
does not take capital expenditures or financing mechanics into consideration. The calculation only considers direct operational costs,
such as electricity and hosting. The mining equipment was originally financed primarily through equity capital raises and cash flows resulting
from the sale of bitcoin generating by mining operations. As of September 30, 2024, there were no financing agreements outstanding related
to financing of mining equipment. 

The breakeven analysis is a non-GAAP measure,
similar to the way the gold industry reports gold-equivalent ounces to provide uniform measure of various revenue streams from different
commodities (such as gold, copper, nickel, etc.). Much like the gold industry, the purpose of this calculation is to offer the reader a
bitcoin-equivalent datapoint for Gryphon s two revenue streams within the context of its primary revenue stream. This enables readers
to easily compare Gryphon s operations with other bitcoin mining companies. By dividing the total cost of revenues by the number
of bitcoin-equivalent coins generated, one arrives at the breakeven point for total BTC equiv. Therefore, if Gryphon sells a bitcoin at
the same price, it would have achieved a breakeven. 

The breakeven cost of mining bitcoin is influenced
primarily by two factors. First, the cost of electricity sourced from Gryphon s hosting providers, which encompasses a combination
of pass-through market electricity prices and profit-sharing arrangements. Second, it is affected by the global hashrate of the Bitcoin
network. Over the twelve-month period through the third quarter of 2024, the cost of electricity plus the profit-sharing arrangement in
place with the hosting provider has fluctuated due to seasonality from 0.0709 per kilowatt hour in the third quarter of 2023 to 0.0624
per kilowatt hour in the third quarter of 2024, reaching a high of 0.0817 per kilowatt hour during Q1 of 2024. In addition, the global
hashrate of the Bitcoin network has shown a consistent upward trend, with sequential increases of 21.6 , 19.0 , 6.8 and 4.3 over the
last four quarters ending September 30, 2024. This increase in the global hashrate has led to fewer bitcoins being mined for the same
amount of energy consumption. The combined effect of these changes in the two key cost drivers has resulted in an increase in the overall
breakeven level as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023.

Recent Developments 

On April 19, 2024, the Company commenced an At
The Market offering program with B. Riley Inc., Ladenburg Thalmann Co. Inc., Kingswood Investments, a division of Kingswood Capital
Partners, LLC, PI Financial (US Corp. and ATB Capital Markets USA Inc., each respectively acting as sales agents, under which the Company
may offer and sell shares of its Common Stock from time to time through the sales agents having an aggregate offering price of up to
 70,000,000. As of May 30, 2024, B. Riley Securities is no longer participating as a sales agent. As of November 13, 2024, the
Company had sold approximately 3.4 million shares under this program for total net proceeds of 2.8 million. 

As previously disclosed, on May 25, 2022, Anchorage entered into the
Anchorage Loan Agreement with Gryphon Opco, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Gryphon, pursuant to which Anchorage loaned Gryphon
Opco the principal amount of 933.333333 bitcoin. Gryphon Opco s obligations under the Anchorage Loan Agreement were secured by certain
equipment and software rights of Gryphon Opco and were guaranteed by Gryphon. As of October 24, 2024, Gryphon owed 304 bitcoins, valued
at approximately 18 million based on an average bitcoin price for the month of September 2024 of 60,286. 

On October 25, 2024, Gryphon, its direct and indirect
subsidiaries, as applicable, and Anchorage entered into the Agreements to restructure the Anchorage Loan and terminate the existing the
Anchorage Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Agreements, (i) approximately 9.1 million of the Anchorage Loan was converted into shares of
Common Stock, at an ascribed value of 1.10 per share, resulting in the issuance of 8,287,984 shares of Common Stock to Anchorage in a
private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, (ii) approximately 3.9 million of the Anchorage Loan was converted
into warrants to purchase 3,530,198 shares of Common Stock, which warrants are exercisable immediately, have a ten year term and an
exercise price of 0.01 per share, in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and (iii) the remaining 5
million of the Anchorage Loan was exchanged for a new 5 million loan pursuant to the New Loan Agreement. 

Pursuant to the New Loan Agreement: 

the outstanding principal and interest are denominated in
dollars; 

the interest rate is 4.25 payable monthly; 

Anchorage has been given a first priority lien on all of
Gryphon and its subsidiaries assets; 

covenants related to mining machine locations and covenant
ratios in the Anchorage Loan Agreement have been removed; and 

Anchorage may convert half of the outstanding principal at
a price of 1.10 per share of Common Stock and the remaining half at a price of 1.50 per share of Common Stock. 

The New Loan Agreement contains customary representations,
warranties and agreements by Gryphon, customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of the Company and the purchasers,
including for liabilities arising under the Securities Act (as defined below), other obligations of the parties and termination provisions.
The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Loan Agreement were made only for the purposes of such agreements and as
of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreements, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the
contracting parties. 

Pursuant to the Agreements, Gryphon also issued
Anchorage warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock, which warrants are exercisable immediately, will expire five years from
the date of issuance and have an exercise price of 1.50 per share. The 1.50 Warrants were issued in a private placement pursuant to
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

The Restructured Loan and the Warrants cannot
be converted or exercised, respectively, if Anchorage (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 19.99 of the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date of the Agreements after giving effect to such conversion or exercise without
the approval of Gryphon s stockholders. Gryphon has agreed to seek such approval at its next annual meeting of stockholders. 

The Coinmint Agreement was terminated on October
31, 2024, with effect on January 1, 2025.

Mining revenues 

Mining revenues increased to 16,694,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14,992,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in mining revenues of
 1,702,000 is due to both an increase in the number of miners in operation and the average value of a Bitcoin. As of September 30, 2024,
the Company had approximately 8,800 miners compared to approximately 8,300 as of September 30, 2023. The average value of Bitcoin for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 60,000 compared to 26,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of
 34,000, or 131 . 

Management services 

Management services revenue decreased to 0 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 844,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Management services revenue
relates to the Sphere MSA, regarding which Sphere 3D delivered a termination notice to the Company on October 6, 2023. See Note 8 - Commitments
and Contingencies. 

Cost of revenues 

Cost of revenues increased to 12,252,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 9,542,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 2,710,000 was
primarily attributable to (i) an increase in the deployment of miners, (ii) an increase in Bitcoin network hashrate, and (iii) higher
energy costs.

Professional fees increased to 3,067,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,626,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1,441,000 was
due to (i) an increase of 261,000 for accounting and other related services, (ii) an increase in legal fees of 792,000, and (iii) 388,000
of professional fees related to the Merger. 

Investor and public relations expenses increased
to 3,694,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to
the Merger. As a newly public company, management hired consulting firms to increase the Company s public exposure. Included in
the 3,694,000 of investor and public relations expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is 1,661,000 of non-cash expense
related to the fair value of common stock issued to consultants. 

Salaries and wages increased to 808,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 507,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 301,000 is due to compensation
for three new directors and hiring one additional employee and estimated bonus accrual for the Company s officers. 

Insurance expense increased to 494,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 125,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 369,000 was attributable
to an increase in insurance premiums as a result of becoming a public company. 

Franchise tax and license increased to 225,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 197,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other expenses increased to 440,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 from 235,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 205,000 is attributable to
an increase in payments of 108,000 to regulatory agencies and a general increase in other expenses of 97,000. 

Loss on MSA - A threat actor representing to be
the CFO inserted themselves into an email exchange between the CFO and the Company s CEO, which also included Sphere 3D s
CEO, regarding the transfer of Sphere 3D s BTC from the Company s wallet to Sphere 3D s wallet. The threat actor requested
that the BTC be transferred to an alternate wallet. As a result, 26 BTC, valued at approximately 560,000 at the time, was transferred
to a wallet controlled by the threat actor. As advised by legal counsel, the Company engaged with US Federal law enforcement to recover
the BTC. Despite these attempts of law enforcement to recover the BTC, recovery was not possible. The Company subsequently wired the commensurate
amount in USD to Sphere 3D to make them whole for the stolen BTC. The Company also engaged a nationally recognized third-party firm to
perform a forensic analysis. The analysis revealed that the threat actor did not enter the email exchange via The Company s IT systems.
Sphere 3D made a claim with its insurance carrier. If its insurance carrier reimburses Sphere 3D s, the Company would request reimbursement
from Sphere 3D. The Company has also subsequently modified its control systems to protect against any future attempted incursions. In
March 2023, the Company paid Sphere for 560,000, which was classified as a general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement
of operations. 

Stock-based compensation 

Stock-based compensation expense increased to
 445,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from a benefit of 629,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
is due to a one-time forfeiture of stock-based compensation of 1,910,000 in connection with termination of an employment agreement in
the prior year period. 

Depreciation 

Depreciation decreased to 9,435,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 from 11,906,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023,
the Company assessed the need for an impairment write-down of mining equipment (held as fixed assets). In accordance with ASC 360-10,
the Company determined that the fixed asset category had carrying values in excess of fair value. Accordingly, the Company recognized
impairment charges, reducing its mining equipment s depreciable basis. Therefore, the depreciation expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 was reduced. 

33 

Impairment of digital assets 

The impairment of digital assets decreased to
 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 250,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Unrealized gain on digital assets 

As of January 1, 2024, the Company implemented
ASU No. 2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Topic 350-60) ASU 2023-08 ): Accounting for and Disclosure
of Crypto Assets. ASU 2023-08 requires entities to measure crypto assets that meet specific criteria at fair value with changes recognized
in net income each reporting period. ASU 2023-08 requires an entity to present crypto assets measured at fair value separately from other
intangible assets in the balance sheets and record changes from the remeasurement of crypto assets separately from changes in the carrying
amounts of other intangible assets in the income statement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a 1,295,000
unrealized gain in the fair market value of its digital asset holdings. 

Realized gain on sale of digital assets 

The realized gain on the sale of digital assets
was 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 484,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. With the implementation
of ASU 2023-08, realized gains on the sale of digital assets will be eliminated since the digital assets will be marked to market prior
to sale.

Mining revenues 

Mining revenues decreased to 3,689,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5,189,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in mining revenues of
 1,500,000 is due to both an increase in the number of miners in operation and the average value of a Bitcoin. As of September 30, 2024,
the Company had approximately 8,800 miners compared to approximately 8,300 as of September 30, 2023. The average value of Bitcoin for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 61,000 compared to 28,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of
 33,000, or 118 . 

35 

Management services 

Management services revenue decreased to 0 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 288,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Management services revenue
relates to the Sphere MSA, regarding which Sphere 3D delivered a termination notice to the Company on October 6, 2023. See Note 8 - Commitments
and Contingencies. 

Cost of revenues 

Cost of revenues decreased to 3,612,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3,982,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 370,000 was primarily
attributable to (i) an increase in the deployment of miners, (ii) an increase in Bitcoin network hashrate, and (iii) higher energy costs.

Professional fees increased to 1,128,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 479,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 649,000 was due
to (i) an increase of 560,000 for legal fees and (ii) an increase of 89,000 for accounting and other related services. 

Investor and public relations expense increased
to 340,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to
the Merger. As a newly public company, management hired consulting firms to increase the Company s public exposure. Included in
the 340,000 of investor and public relations expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is 215,000 of non-cash expense related
to the fair value of common stock issued to consultants. 

Salaries and wages increased to 354,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 from 205,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Insurance expense increased to 193,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 from 41,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 152,000 was attributable
to an increase in our insurance premiums as a result of becoming a public company. 

Franchise tax and license increased to 199,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other expenses increased to 225,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 from 76,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Stock-based compensation 

Stock-based compensation expense decreased to
 97,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 392,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

36 

Depreciation expense 

Depreciation expense decreased to 2,896,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4,067,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the year ended December
31, 2023, the Company assessed the need for an impairment write-down of mining equipment (held as fixed assets). In accordance with ASC
360-10, the Company determined that the fixed asset category had carrying values in excess of fair value. Accordingly, the Company recognized
impairment charges, reducing its mining equipment s depreciable basis. Therefore, the depreciation expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 was reduced. 

Impairment of digital assets 

Impairment of digital assets decreased to 0 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 17,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Unrealized gain on digital assets 

As of January 1, 2024, the Company implemented
ASU No. 2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Topic 350-60) ASU 2023-08 ): Accounting for and Disclosure
of Crypto Assets. ASU 2023-08 requires entities to measure crypto assets that meet specific criteria at fair value with changes recognized
in net income each reporting period. ASU 2023-08 requires an entity to present crypto assets measured at fair value separately from other
intangible assets in the balance sheets and record changes from the remeasurement of crypto assets separately from changes in the carrying
amounts of other intangible assets in the income statement. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a 90,000
unrealized loss in the fair market value of its digital asset holdings. 

Realized gain on sale of digital assets 

Realized gain on the sale of digital assets was
 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. With the implementation
of ASU 2023-08, realized gains on the sale of digital assets will be eliminated since the digital assets will be marked to market prior
to sale.

37 

Change in fair value of notes payable 

The Company has a note payable denominated in
Bitcoin, which is accounted for under the fair value method of accounting. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company
recognized a 194,000 decrease in the fair value of notes payable, compared to a 1,342,000 increase for the three months ended September
30, 2023. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense increased to 288,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 from 162,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 126,000 is primarily
due to the Amendment of the BTC Note on March 29, 2023. 

Loss on disposal of asset 

Loss on disposal of asset was 0 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 368,000 and 915,000, respectively, and an accumulated deficit of approximately 68,137,000
and 47,175,000, respectively. To date, the Company has financed its operations primarily through proceeds from the sales of its equity
securities through private placements and it s at-the-market program as described below, borrowings pursuant to the Sphere 3D Note
and the BTC Note, as amended, and cash flow from its digital currency mining operations (including revenue received under the Sphere 3D
MSA). 

The Company believes that its current levels of
cash will not be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for its operations for at least the next 12 months. The Company will require
additional capital resources to fund its operations and pay its obligations as they come due over the next twelve months. The Company
may also need to implement its strategy to expand its business or other investments or acquisitions. The Company may sell additional equity
or debt securities or enter into a credit facility to satisfy its capital requirements. The sale of additional equity securities could
result in dilution to its shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require
the Company to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict its operations. Financing may not be available in amounts
or on terms acceptable to the Company if at all. Any failure by the Company to raise additional funds on terms favorable to it, or at
all, could limit its ability to expand its business operations and could harm its overall business prospects. 

On June 10, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement
for the offering, issuance and sale of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of 70.0 million of common stock that may be issued and
sold under an at-the-market issuance sales agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann Co. Inc., Kingswood Investments, a division of Kingswood
Capital Partners, LLC, PI Financial (US Corp. and ATB Capital Markets USA Inc., each respectively acting as sales agents, (the ATM ).
We have used and intend to continue to use the net proceeds from the ATM for general corporate purposes, including without limitation,
capital expenditures, funding potential acquisitions of additional new mining equipment, other potential acquisitions, investments in
existing and future Bitcoin mining projects and repurchases and redemptions of our common stock and general working capital. The ATM will
terminate upon the earlier of (i) the issuance and sale of all of the shares of the common stock subject to the conditions set forth in
the ATM or (ii) termination of the ATM as otherwise permitted thereunder. The ATM may be terminated at any time by either the Company
or any sales agent with respect to itself upon five days prior notice, or by the sales agents at any time in certain circumstances,
including the occurrence of a material adverse effect on us. As of November 13, 2024, approximately 67.2 million in capacity remains
under the ATM.

Capital Expenditures and Other Obligations 

Coinmint Agreement 

On July 1, 2021, the Company entered into the
Coinmint Agreement, with Coinmint, an established operator of renewable-energy data centers, pursuant to which Coinmint provides hosting
services to the Company at Coinmint s hydro powered facility in Massena, New York (the Coinmint Facility for a 15-month
period, which upon its conclusion renews automatically for successive three-month terms unless either party delivers to the other party
90 days written notice of intent not to renew. Pursuant to the terms of the Coinmint Agreement, 7,200 S19j Pro Antminer machines
were delivered to and installed at the Coinmint Facility. Under the terms of the Coinmint Agreement, Coinmint directly passes through
the cost of electricity and maintenance costs to the Company, collects an initial reservation fee and collects a percentage of the Company s
bitcoin mining profits. 

The Coinmint Agreement was terminated on October
31, 2024, with effect on January 1, 2025. 

BTC Note 

On May 25, 2022, Gryphon Opco I LLC, a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Equipment Loan and Security Agreement with a lender amounting to 933.333333 Bitcoin at
an annual interest rate of 5 . 

The BTC Note is secured by (1) 7,200 S19j Pros
ASIC miners used for Bitcoin mining, (2) The Colocation Mining Services Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2022, by and between the Company
and Coinmint, and (3) The Contribution Agreement, dated as of May 25, 2022, by and between Borrower and the lender. 

The Company evaluated the BTC Note in accordance
with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. Based on this evaluation, the Company has determined that the BTC Note will require derivative accounting
and will be adjusted to fair value every reporting period. The fair value is determined by using the lowest day trading value, as of the
reporting date, as disclosed on Yahoo Finance. 

On March 29, 2023, the Company amended and restated
the BTC Note. The maturity date was extended from May 2024 to March 2026, and the interest rate was increased to 6 per annum, to be applied
to the number of bitcoins remaining to be paid at the beginning of each month. 

39 

The monthly principal and interest payments, starting
with the April 2023 payment, were adjusted to be 100 of net monthly mining revenue, defined as, for each calendar month, the sum of (a)
all of Borrower s revenue generated from all Bitcoin generated by the Borrower with the Collateral less (b) the sum of the
Borrower SG A in connection with Bitcoin mining operations, but not to exceed the greater of (x) 100,000 and (y) the amount that
was previously preapproved by the Lender in writing for such calendar month; provided, however that, to the extent that SG A was capped
by clause (b) above, any unapplied SG A could be rolled forward to subsequent months until fully deducted. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
unless otherwise approved by Lender, the aggregate amount of SG A during any rolling twelve-month period would not exceed 750,000,
provided that if at the end of a fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2023, if (x) the aggregate principal
amount payment received by the Lender for such fiscal quarter exceeded 38.6363638 Bitcoin and (y) the average principal amount payment
received by the Lender for each fiscal quarter (commencing fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2023 and through and including the fiscal quarter
for which such determination was to be made) exceeds 38.6363638 Bitcoin per fiscal quarter, then, the Borrower would pay to the Lender
75 of Net Monthly Mining Revenue for the immediately succeeding fiscal quarter (and thereafter, in the following fiscal quarter would
shift to 100 ). In the event that the Net Monthly Mining Revenue for any month was insufficient to cover interest payment under the BTC
Note, such deficiency would be deemed paid-in-kind by capitalizing such deficiency in interest payment and adding such amount to the principal
amount of indebtedness under the BTC Note. 

Also, as part of the Amendment, the Company agreed
not to convey, sell, lease, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of any of the Company s digital assets outside of the ordinary
course of business. 

Additionally, the Company was required thereunder
to maintain a collateral (mining equipment and digital assets) coverage ratio of 110 . A breach of the Collateral Coverage Ratio would
not be deemed to have occurred until the lender provided notice to the Company of such breach. If the Collateral Coverage Ratio decreased
below 110 , the Company would have to provide the lender with additional collateral in the form of bitcoin, U.S. dollars, or additional
equipment. If the Company was unable to do so, it would be in default on the BTC Note, which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s operations, financial condition, and results of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was not in breach of
the Collateral Coverage Ratio. 

The Amendment also added a conversion provision
whereby the lender has a limited right to convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal on the BTC Note into a number of shares
of the Company. The Conversion Right was available at any time during the one-month period after which the market capitalization of the
Company for the first time exceeded 125,000,000 for five consecutive days. The conversion price was equal to 150,000,000 divided by
the number of shares of Company common stock outstanding immediately prior to the lender s exercise of the Conversion Right during
the Conversion Period. 

As consideration for the Amendment, the Company
agreed to make a one-time payment of 173.17 bitcoins, which had a fair value of approximately 4,856,000 on the date of payment, therefore,
reducing the principal balance of bitcoins from 636.81 to 463.64, and a closing fee of 104,000, which was offset with the adjustment
for the change in fair value, as defined under debt modification accounting. 

The Company has evaluated the Amendment in accordance
with ASC 470-50 Modification and Extinguishments. The change in the interest rate from 5.0 to 6.0 caused there to be a significant change
in the cashflows of the BTC Note. Also, given that the BTC Note carried on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at fair
value, any gain on loss from the extinguishment would be adjusted through the change in fair value as of September 30, 2024. 

Also, based on the repayment terms and the interest
calculation, the Company is unable to determine what would be the current portion and long-term portions as of September 30, 2024, so
the Company will present the BTC Note as current. 

Although the BTC Note was payable with the Company s
digital assets earned from mining activities, there was a potential for the use of cash under the collateral agreement. If the collateral
coverage ratio decreases below 110 , the Company would have to provide the lender with additional collateral in the form of bitcoin, U.S.
dollars or additional equipment. 

Subsequent to September 30, 2024, on October 25,
2024, the Company and Anchorage entered into the Debt Repayment and Exchange Agreement (the DPE Agreement ), Loan, Guaranty
and Security Agreement (the New Loan Agreement ), the Pre-Funded Warrants (as defined below) and the 1.50 Warrants (as defined
below) (together, the Agreements to restructure the Anchorage Loan (the Restructuring and terminate the
existing the Anchorage Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Agreements, (i) approximately 9.1 million of the Anchorage Loan was converted
into shares of Common Stock, at an ascribed value of 1.10 per share, resulting in the issuance of 8,287,984 shares of Common Stock to
Anchorage in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, (ii) approximately 3.9 million of the Anchorage Loan
was converted into warrants to purchase 3,530,198 shares of Common Stock, which warrants are exercisable immediately, have a ten year
term and an exercise price of 0.01 per share (the Pre-Funded Warrants ), in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act and (iii) the remaining 5 million of the Anchorage Loan was exchanged for a new 5 million loan (the Restructured
Loan pursuant to the New Loan Agreement. 

40 

Restructured Loan 

Pursuant to the New Loan Agreement: 

the outstanding principal and interest are denominated in
dollars; 

the interest rate is 4.25 payable monthly; 

Anchorage has been given a first priority lien on all of
Gryphon and its subsidiaries assets; 

covenants related to mining machine locations and covenant
ratios in the Anchorage Loan Agreement have been removed; and 

Anchorage may convert half of the outstanding principal at
a price of 1.10 per share of Common Stock and the remaining half at a price of 1.50 per share of Common Stock. 

The Restructured Loan and the Warrants cannot
be converted or exercised, respectively, if Anchorage (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 19.99 of the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date of the Agreements after giving effect to such conversion or exercise without
the approval of Gryphon s stockholders. Gryphon agreed to seek such approval at its next annual meeting of stockholders. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company recognized interest expense amounting to 608,000 of which 93,000 is still accrued. 

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued
interest expense amounting to 77,000. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses,
and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition
or results of operations would be affected. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on
historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable after taking into account our circumstances and expectations
for the future based on available information. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical
if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate
was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that
we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined above. 

The critical accounting policies, and the judgements,
estimates, and assumptions associated with such policies, that we believe have the greatest potential impact on the condensed consolidated
financial statements are disclosed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2023. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB or other standards-setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. Updates to the FASB ASC are communicated
through the issuance of an Accounting Standards Update ASU ). The Company considers the applicability and impact of all
ASUs on the Company s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof. Described below are ASUs that
are not yet effective but may be applicable to the Company s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation
thereof. As of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements, there were no ASUs that management assessed and determined to
be applicable to the Company s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In addition to the Company s results determined
in accordance with GAAP, the Company also provides adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measurement of financial performance under generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Company provides investors with reconciliations from net loss to adjusted EBITDA
as components of Management s Discussion and Analysis. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as (a) GAAP net income (loss) plus (b)
adjustments to add back the impacts of (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) interest expense, (3) income tax expense (benefit) and (4)
adjustments for non-cash and non-recurring items which currently include (i) stock compensation expense, (ii) change in fair value of
notes payable and (iii) unrealized (gain) loss on marketable equity securities. 

41 

Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure of
performance under GAAP and, as a result, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP
financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared
in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with
the Company s Interim Reports on Form 10-Q and its Annual Reports on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Management uses adjusted EBITDA and the supplemental information provided herein as a means of understanding, managing, and evaluating
business performance and to help inform operating decision making. The Company relies primarily on its condensed consolidated financial
statements to understand, manage, and evaluate its financial performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. 

The following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP
adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure (i.e., net income (loss)) for the nine months ended September 30:

Recently Adopted Pronouncements 

On December 13, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No.
2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Topic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets. ASU 2023-08
requires entities to measure crypto assets that meet specific criteria at fair value with changes recognized in net income each reporting
period. Additionally, ASU 2023-08 requires an entity to present crypto assets measured at fair value separately from other intangible
assets in the balance sheets and record changes from remeasurement of crypto assets separately from changes in the carrying amounts of
other intangible assets in the income statement. The new standard is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January 1,
2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-08 on January 1, 2024. The adoption of the ASU 2023-08 was a 739,000
increase of our digital assets, as of January 1, 2024.

Not applicable for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this Report,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our Certifying Officers conducted evaluations of our disclosure
controls and procedures. As defined under Sections 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act ), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC ). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the issuer s management, including the Certifying Officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Based on their evaluation, the Certifying Officers
concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

The material weakness related to internal control
over financial reporting that was identified at September 30, 2024 was that we did not have sufficient personnel staffing in our accounting
and financial reporting department. As a result, we were not able to achieve adequate segregation of duties and were not able to provide
for adequate review of the financial statements. 

This control deficiency could result in a reasonable
possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. However, our
management believes that the material weakness identified does not result in the restatement of any previously reported financial statements
or any other related financial disclosure, and management does not believe that the material weakness had any effect on the accuracy of
our financial statements included as part of this Report. 

We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to
taking action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. Management has commenced the
following actions and will continue to assess additional opportunities for remediation on an ongoing basis: 

Continue the process that was
started during 2024 of adding to the Company s internal resources to enhance its capabilities in the areas of technical accounting,
financial reporting, and internal controls, that may include hiring a full-time person dedicated to internal controls. 

Utilize external third-party
audit and SOX 404 implementation firms to enable the Company to improve the Company s controls related to its material weaknesses. 

Continue to evaluate existing
processes and implement new processes and controls where necessary in connection with remediating the Company s material weaknesses,
such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. 

The Company recognizes that the material weaknesses
in its internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls operate for a sufficient
period of time and can be tested and concluded by management to be designed and operating effectively. Because the Company s remediation
efforts are ongoing, it cannot provide any assurance that these remediation efforts will be successful or that its internal control over
financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts. 

The Company continues to evaluate and work to
improve its internal control over financial reporting related to the identified material weaknesses, and management may determine to take
additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify the remediation plan described above. In addition, the Company
will report the progress and status of the above remediation efforts to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

During the most recently completed fiscal quarter,
there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f))
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

Sphere 3D Litigation 

On April 7, 2023, Sphere 3D filed an action against
Gryphon in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging claims for breach of the Sphere MSA entered between
the parties on August 19, 2021, and subsequently amended on December 29, 2021, as well as claims for breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing and breach of fiduciary duty. 

On June 15, 2023, Sphere 3D filed an amended complaint
in connection with the Sphere 3D Litigation, which clarified certain of Sphere 3D s prior allegations. On June 28, 2023, Gryphon
requested leave to file a motion to dismiss Sphere 3D s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, which the Court granted on August 11, 2023. On August 18, 2023, Gryphon filed: (i) its motion to dismiss
Sphere 3D s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (ii) its
answer and counterclaims against Sphere 3D, asserting, among other things, that Sphere had breached the Sphere MSA, breached the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing in connection with that contract, acted negligently in connection with a separate incident, and
defamed Gryphon. Gryphon s answer and counterclaims further asserted the defamation counterclaim against Sphere 3D s Chief
Executive Officer, Patricia Trompeter, personally. 

On September 20, 2023, Sphere 3D filed a second
amended complaint in connection with the Sphere 3D Litigation, which added a claim against Gryphon alleging that Gryphon s counterclaim
for defamation against Sphere 3D violated New York s anti-SLAPP law. 

On October 6, 2023, Sphere 3D delivered a purported
termination notice to Gryphon (the Sphere 3D MSA Termination regarding the Master Service Agreement MSA previously entered by the parties on August 19, 2021, and subsequently amended on December 29, 2021, largely on the basis of the deficient
allegations made by Sphere 3D in the Sphere 3D Litigation. On January 17, 2024, Gryphon filed an amended answer with fourth amended counterclaims
to Sphere 3D s second amended complaint, in which, among other things, Gryphon alleged that Sphere 3D s attempted termination
of the Sphere MSA was wrongful and ineffective because it violated the express terms of the MSA. Gryphon is also seeking relief based
on Sphere s repeated breaches of the exclusivity terms of the MSA. Gryphon intends to continue to vigorously defend against the
Sphere 3D Litigation, which it believes is without merit, and to aggressively pursue its counterclaim s against Sphere
3D for Sphere 3D s repeated violations of the MSA. 

On February 1, 2024, Gryphon filed an amended
answer and its own counterclaim against Sphere 3D. Gryphon s counterclaim alleges that Sphere 3D flagrantly and repeatedly breached
the terms of the MSA, including, among other breaching conduct, entering into multiple bitcoin mining hosting agreements with third-parties in violation of
the MSA s exclusivity clause and improperly terminating the MSA on October 6, 2023. 

On March 25, 2024, Gryphon filed a pre-motion
letter with the Court seeking pre-judgment attachment of the equity shares in Core that Sphere 3D received as a result of the Core Settlement
(as defined below) to secure a judgment against Sphere 3D. 

On June 27, 2024, during a discovery conference,
Sphere 3D agreed that it was not seeking to impose any liability against Gryphon for events that occurred in late February 2023 whereby
a hostile actor impersonated Sphere 3D s chief financial officer in an email sent to both Sphere 3D and Gryphon s personnel
and requested the transfer of bitcoin (worth approximately 560,000) from a Sphere 3D wallet controlled by Gryphon. Gryphon intends to
continue to vigorously defend against the Sphere 3D Litigation, which it believes lacks merit, and to aggressively pursue its counterclaim
against Sphere 3D for Sphere 3D s repeated violations of the MSA. The parties are in the discovery stage in the litigation. 

Gryphon cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings
or provide an estimate of potential damages or recovery, if any. Failure by Gryphon to obtain a favorable resolution of the Sphere 3D
Litigation could require it to pay damage awards or otherwise enter into settlement arrangements for which its insurance coverage may
be insufficient. Any such damage awards or settlement arrangements in current or future litigation could have a material adverse effect
on Gryphon s business, operating results or financial condition. Even if Sphere 3D s claims are not successful, or if Gryphon
is successful in pursuing its counterclaims or negotiating a favorable settlement, defending against this or future litigation is expensive
and could divert management s attention and resources, all of which could have an adverse and material impact on Gryphon s
business, operating results and financial condition and negatively affect Gryphon s value. Further, any valid termination of the
Sphere MSA in accordance with its terms could also have a negative impact on Gryphon s business and operating results. In addition,
such lawsuits may make it more difficult for Gryphon to finance its operations in the future.

Core Complaint and Related Matters 

In connection with the ongoing Core Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, on November 21, 2023,
the Company was notified that Core Scientific and its debtor affiliates filed an adversary proceeding complaint Core Complaint against Sphere 3D and the Company Core Litigation ). As it pertains to the Company, the Core Complaint alleged, among other
things, that the Company breached certain miner hosting agreements between Core and the Company by failing to deliver miners to Core under
the miner hosting agreements. The Core Complaint sought damages in the amount of 100 million and a declaratory judgment that Core has
no continuing obligations under those miner hosting agreements. The Company disputed the allegations of the complaint and was prepared
to assert all available defenses as well as counterclaims against Core. However, before the Company had to respond to the Core Complaint,
the parties reached a mutually agreeable settlement where all claims against the Company would be released and the Core Complaint dismissed
with prejudice. Therefore, on January 2, 2024, the Core Debtors filed an emergency motion in the Core Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings,
seeking the Court s approval of a settlement resolving all claims as between the Core Debtors, on the one hand, and Sphere 3D and
Gryphon on the other hand, arising from the miner hosting agreements; any claims and disputes as between Sphere 3D and Gryphon are excluded
from this proposed settlement. The Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement by order entered on January 16, 2024 (the Core Settlement ). 

On November 21, 2023, the Company was notified
by Core Scientific, Inc. that Core intended to cease hosting operations of 133 ASIC miners that the Company had operating at Core as of
September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had removed its hosted equipment pursuant to the terms of the operative Master
Services Agreement between the Company and Core. This hosted capacity represented approximately 1 of the Company s overall fleet
and management does not anticipate this action to result in a material impact to its operations. The Company relocated those miners to
its other existing operations. 

PPP Loan 

On April 21, 2020, the Company obtained a loan
in the principal aggregate amount of 2.2 million (the PPP Loan pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES
Act, which was forgiven in full, by the SBA, on September 3, 2021. 

On February 5, 2024, the Company received a letter,
dated January 25, 2024, from the SBA, on behalf of Key Bank, in which the SBA indicated that, notwithstanding its prior notification of
forgiveness, in full, of repayment of the PPP Loan, it was reviewing its prior determination of forgiveness for potential reversal. Specifically,
the SBA indicated that based on its preliminary findings, the SBA is considering a full denial of the previously received forgiven amount
based on the purported ineligibility of the Company to have received the PPP Loan under the SBA loan programs because the Company, operating
as Akerna at the time of the PPP Loan, provided software support to the cannabis industry. The Company responded to the SBA on February
6, 2024, providing reasons as to why it believes it was eligible for the PPP Loan, but has not received any further correspondence from
the SBA, since that date, and the SBA has not made any financial demands. The Company plans to continue to cooperate with any further
inquiry from the SBA. 

In January 2024, the Company received a civil
investigative demand from the DOJ seeking information and documents about the PPP Loan. The Company is cooperating with the inquiry. At
this time, there has been no formal demand for return of the PPP Loan proceeds, and no formal claim or lawsuit has been initiated against
the Company. 

Dutchie Litigation 

On January 13, 2023, Courier Plus Inc. d/b/a Dutchie Dutchie filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas, Dauphin County, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania against Akerna and
MJ Freeway, LLC MJF (which was a wholly-owned subsidiary prior to the closing of the Business Combination), alleging unfair
competition, tortious interference, and unjust enrichment with respect to MJF s exclusive government contract with the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania. We filed a preliminary objection alleging serious defects, such as jurisdiction. The parties attended a hearing in July
2023. In October 2023, the courts dismissed the case but left some items available in the complaint for an appeal. Dutchie has amended
its complaint and filed again. We filed another preliminary objection to their amended complaint. A hearing on our preliminary objections
was conducted, and the court granted in part and denied in part the second preliminary objections. Before and throughout this dispute,
we have worked with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to ensure continued compliance with our contract. We intend to continue to defend
our position vigorously and, at this time, do not believe an estimate of potential loss, if any, is appropriate. 

45 

TreCom Litigation 

On April 2, 2021, TreCom Systems Group, Inc. TreCom filed suit against Akerna and MJF in federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, seeking recovery of up to approximately
 4.2 million for breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims pursuant to a Subcontractor Agreement between MJF and TreCom. MJF provided a notice of termination
of the operative Subcontractor Agreement on August 4, 2020. MJF disputes the validity of TreCom s invoices and the enforceability
of the alleged agreement that TreCom submitted to the court. Akerna filed counterclaims against TreCom for breach of contract, a declaratory
judgment, commercial disparagement, and defamation. TreCom failed to return Akerna s intellectual property and issued numerous disparaging
statements to one of Akerna s clients. TreCom subsequently filed a motion to dismiss these counterclaims, which was denied by the
court. The court denied both parties motions for summary judgment. A trial is currently set to commence on December 2, 2024. Akerna
intends to vigorously defend against TreCom s claims, and pursue its own claims. With respect to the TreCom matter, we established
a loss contingency of 0.2 million in 2021 on the books of MJF which remains outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 

Former CEO Litigation 

As previously disclosed, on September 17, 2024,
Robby Chang was terminated as Chief Executive Officer and President of Gryphon for cause, with immediate effect, by the Board. Mr. Chang
remains a member of the Board. 

On October 21, 2024, the Company received notice
that both it and Ivy Crypto, Inc., a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Company, have been named as defendants in a complaint filed
by Mr. Chang in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Canada, alleging wrongful termination (the Claim ). The Company
intends to defend this matter vigorously. 

On October 22, 2024, the Board created a special
committee to oversee the Company s handling of the Claim made up of Steve Gutterman, Jimmy Vaiopoulos, Dan Tolhurst and Jessica
Billingsley. 

From time to time, we may be subject to other
legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the outcome of any existing or future litigation, litigation
can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Except for the additional risk factor set forth
below, there have been no material changes to our Risk Factors as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, as amended. 

There can be no assurance that we will be
able to comply with the applicable listing standards of Nasdaq. 

Our eligibility for listing on Nasdaq depends
on our ability to comply with Nasdaq s applicable continued listing requirements. 

On September 5, 2024, we received written notice
from Nasdaq indicating that the bid price for our common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, had closed below the minimum
 1.00 per share and, as a result, we are not in compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement for the continued listing on Nasdaq,
as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). 

In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule
5810(c)(3)(A), we have a period of 180 calendar days, or until March 4, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the common stock must meet or exceed 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business
days during this 180-day period. 

If we are not in compliance
by March 4, 2025, we may qualify for a second 180 calendar day compliance period. To qualify, we will be required to meet the continued
listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for Nasdaq, with the exception of
the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance
period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If it appears to Nasdaq that we will not be able to cure the deficiency,
or we are otherwise not eligible, then Nasdaq will notify the Company of its determination to delist its Common Stock, at which
point the Company would have an option to appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. 

On September 13, 2024, we received another notice
from Nasdaq notifying us that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) as a result of our Market Value of
Listed Securities (the MVLS falling below the minimum of 35 million required for continued listing on Nasdaq (the MVLS
Requirement from July 31, 2024 to September 12, 2024. 

46 

In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule
5810(c)(3)(C), Nasdaq has provided us with 180 calendar days, or until March 12, 2025, to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement.
To regain compliance during the 180-day period, our MVLS must be at least 35 million for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at
any time during this period, after which Nasdaq will provide written confirmation of compliance us and the matter will be closed.
If we do not regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement by that date, or qualify under an alternative listing standard, we will receive
written notification from Nasdaq that our securities are subject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal any such delisting
determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. 

We are considering available options to regain
compliance Nasdaq s continued listing requirements. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain such compliance. 

If Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading
on its exchange, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including: 

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

a determination that our common stock is
a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting
in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; 

a limited amount of analyst coverage; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

Termination of our agreement with Coinmint may materially our
operations, financial condition, and results of operations. 

On October 31, 2024, we terminated our hosting agreement with
Coinmint, with effect on January 1, 2025. The termination of our sole hosting agreement, which provides the infrastructure necessary
for the housing, maintenance, and operation of our bitcoin mining machines, may have a significant adverse effect on our business.
This agreement has been essential to our bitcoin mining operations, as it allowed us to operate without directly investing in our
own physical infrastructure. With the termination of this arrangement, we currently lack a replacement hosting solution. 

This disruption exposes us to numerous risks, including the
potential for a decline in our market position, reduced operational efficiency, and the likelihood of increased operational costs if
we are required to secure emergency or short-term hosting solutions at unfavorable terms. In addition, we may need to devote
significant resources to identify and secure a new hosting arrangement. There can be no assurance that we will find a suitable or
economically viable replacement in a timely manner, if at all. 

Restrictive covenants in our loan agreement
with Anchorage may limit our operating flexibility and ability to engage in certain transactions that may be in our long-term best interest. 

The New Loan Agreement (as defined below) contains
certain covenants that limit Gryphon s ability to engage in certain transactions that may be in Gryphon s long-term best interest.
Subject to certain limited exceptions, these covenants do or may limit Gryphon s ability to or prohibit Gryphon from permitting
any of its subsidiaries to, as applicable, among other things: 

make any conveyance, sale, lease, division, sale
and leaseback, assignment, transfer or other disposition of assets, subject to certain exceptions; 

create, incur, assume, or be liable for any additional
indebtedness, or create, incur, allow, or permit to exist any additional liens, subject to certain exceptions; 

make any dividend or other distribution on Gryphon
shares, or any payment (whether in cash, securities or other property) on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement, acquisition,
cancellation or termination of any Gryphon shares, or on account of any return of capital to Gryphon s shareholders in respect of
their shares; or 

merge or consolidate with another entity. 

While Gryphon has not previously breached and
is currently in compliance with the covenants contained in the New Loan Agreement, Gryphon may breach these covenants in the future. Gryphon s
ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events and factors beyond its control. In the event that Gryphon breaches one
or more covenants, Anchorage may choose to declare an event of default and require that Gryphon immediately repay all amounts outstanding
under the New Loan Agreement and terminate any commitment to extend further credit and foreclose on the collateral. The occurrence of
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds 

Except as previously reported in our Current Reports
on Form 8-K, we did not undertake any unregistered sales of our equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the
Company did not repurchase any of its common shares.
