 and consisted of cash on hand and short-term borrowings. Acquisition-related costs for the Weaver acquisition were immaterial. 
 The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, Weaver has been included within the North America Salty Snacks segment from the date of acquisition. The purchase consideration was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values and consisted of to goodwill, to property, plant and equipment, net and to other net assets acquired. The purchase price allocation has been finalized as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not include measurement period adjustments. 
 Goodwill was determined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill derived from this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes and reflects the value of leveraging our supply chain capabilities to accelerate growth and access to our portfolio of salty snacks products.

 - to -month periods. Our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of as of September 29, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. 
 Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded as incurred within cost of sales. As discussed in Note 13 , we define our segment income to exclude gains and losses on commodity derivatives until the related inventory is sold, at which time the related gains and losses are reflected within segment income. This enables us to continue to align the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged and thereby eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our reported segment income. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Price Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our international operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt and other non-functional currency transactions of certain subsidiaries. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound, Brazilian real, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso and Swiss franc. We typically utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge these exposures for periods ranging from to months. The contracts are either designated as cash flow hedges or are undesignated. The net notional amount of foreign exchange contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges was at September 29, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. The effective portion of the changes in fair value on these contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The net notional amount of foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was at September 29, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. The change in fair value on these instruments is recorded directly in cost of sales or selling, marketing and administrative SM A expense, depending on the nature of the underlying exposure. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 In order to manage interest rate exposure, from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions. These swaps, which are settled upon issuance of the related debt, are designated as cash flow hedges and the gains and losses that are deferred in other comprehensive income are being recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period that the hedged interest payments affect earnings. 
 Equity Price Risk 
 We are exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices related to our deferred compensation obligations to our employees. To mitigate this risk, we use equity swap contracts to hedge the portion of the exposure that is linked to market-level equity returns. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are entered into for periods of to months. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expense, together with the change in the related liabilities. The notional amount of the contracts outstanding at September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was and , respectively.

 (1) The fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts is the difference between the contract and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period. We estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. 
 (2) The fair value of deferred compensation derivatives is based on quoted prices for market interest rates and a broad market equity index. 
 (3) The fair value of commodities futures and options contracts is based on quoted market prices. 
 Other Financial Instruments 
 The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximated fair values as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. 
 The estimated fair value of our long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for similar debt issues and is, therefore, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. Long-term debt Total

However, segment operating results do not include these business realignment expenses because we evaluate segment performance excluding such costs. 
 2020 International Optimization Program 
 In the fourth quarter of 2020, we commenced a program International Optimization Program to streamline resources and investments in select international markets, including the optimization of our China operating model that will improve our operational efficiency and provide for a strong, sustainable and simplified base going forward. 
 The International Optimization Program was originally expected to total pre-tax costs of to , with cash costs in the range of to , primarily related to workforce reductions of approximately positions outside of the United States, costs to consolidate and relocate production, and third-party costs incurred to execute these activities. The costs and related benefits of the International Optimization Program relate to the International

 . The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 were and , respectively. Relative to the statutory rate, the 2024 effective tax rate was primarily impacted by investment tax credits partially offset by state taxes. 
 The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the United States, including various state and local returns, and in other foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely audited by taxing authorities in our filing jurisdictions, and a number of these disputes are currently underway, including multi-year controversies at various stages of review, negotiation and litigation in Mexico, Canada, Switzerland and the United States. The outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty, including the timing of resolution or potential settlements. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Based on our current assessments, we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. We reasonably expect reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately within the next 12 months because of the expiration of statutes of limitations and settlements of tax audits. 
 Inflation Reduction Act 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act IRA was signed into law. The IRA enacted a 15 corporate minimum tax on certain corporations and an excise tax on share repurchases after December 31, 2022, and created and extended certain energy-related tax credits and incentives. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 the tax-related provisions of the IRA did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, including our annual effective tax rate, or on our liquidity.

 Performance Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units 
 Under the EICP, we grant PSUs to select executives and other key employees. Vesting is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance objectives. We grant PSUs over performance cycles. If we meet targets for financial measures at the end of the applicable performance cycle, we award a resulting number of shares of our Common Stock to the participants. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. 
 For PSUs granted, the target award is a combination of a market-based total shareholder return and performance-based components. For market-based condition components, market volatility and other factors are taken into consideration in determining the grant date fair value and the related compensation expense is recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. For performance-based condition components, we estimate the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved each quarter and adjust compensation expenses accordingly. The performance scores of PSU grants during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 can range from to of the targeted amounts.

term. Compensation expenses are based on the grant date fair value because the grants can only be settled in shares of our Common Stock. The grant date fair value of PSUs is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based total shareholder return component and the closing market price of the Company s Common Stock on the date of grant for performance-based components. 
 During the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, we awarded RSUs to certain executive officers and other key employees under the EICP. We also awarded RSUs to non-employee directors. 
 We recognize the compensation expenses associated with employee RSUs over a specified award vesting period based on the grant date fair value of our Common Stock. We recognize expense for employee RSUs based on the straight- line method.

 reportable segments: (i) North America Confectionery, (ii) North America Salty Snacks and (iii) International. This organizational structure aligns with how our CODM manages our business, including resource allocation and performance assessment, and further aligns with our product categories and the key markets we serve. 
 North America Confectionery This segment is responsible for our traditional chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery market position in the United States and Canada. This includes our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, gum and refreshment products, protein bars, spreads, snack bites and mixes, as well as pantry and food service lines. This segment also includes our retail operations, including Hershey s Chocolate World stores in Hershey, Pennsylvania; New York, New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Niagara Falls (Ontario) and Singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain of the Company s trademarks and products to third parties around the world. 
 North America Salty Snacks This segment is responsible for our salty snacking products in the United States. This includes ready-to-eat popcorn, baked and trans fat free snacks, pretzels and other snacks. 
 International International is a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually material, including those geographic regions where we operate outside of North America. We currently have operations and manufacture product in Mexico, Brazil, India and Malaysia, primarily for consumers in these regions, and also distribute and sell confectionery products in export markets of Asia, Latin America, Middle East, Europe, Africa and other regions. 
 For segment reporting purposes, we use segment income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance. These items of our operating income are managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the CODM as well as the measure of segment performance used for incentive compensation purposes. 
 As discussed in Note 5 , derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. These derivatives are recognized at fair market value with the resulting realized and unrealized (gains) losses recognized in unallocated derivative (gains) losses outside of the reporting segment results until the related inventory is sold, at which time the related gains and losses are reallocated to segment income. This enables us to align the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged and thereby eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our reported segment income. 
 Certain manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and other activities supporting our global operations are integrated to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, assets and capital expenditures are not managed on a segment basis and are not included in the information reported to the CODM for the purpose of evaluating performance or allocating resources. We disclose depreciation and amortization that is generated by segment-specific assets, since these amounts are included within the measure of segment income reported to the CODM.

TRENDS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS 
 Throughout the first nine months of 2024, U.S. consumer behavior has continued to shift and evolve, as cost fatigue and labor markets restrict income growth and constrain consumer spending and purchasing patterns. As a result, consumer behavior related to our products has shifted. As such, during the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we continued to experience a dynamic macroeconomic environment, including price volatility related to select commodities, resulting in corresponding incremental costs and gross margin pressures, and net sales and net income declines. Despite specific actions taken to mitigate these gross margin pressures, we continue to experience overall declines in consumer demands for our products, and higher prices for direct materials used to manufacture our products were, and continue to be, the primary incremental cost to our business (see Consolidated Results of Operations included in this MD A). We utilize many exchange traded commodities for our business that are subject to price volatility, specifically cocoa products, which experienced a market price increase of approximately 70 since the beginning of the year (see Part I, Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 
 Furthermore, certain geopolitical events, specifically the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have increased global economic and political uncertainty. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, this conflict did not have a material impact on our commodity prices or supply availability. However, we are continuing to monitor for any significant escalation or expansion of economic or supply chain disruptions or broader inflationary costs, which may result in material adverse effects on our results of operations. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our key strategic initiatives and other material cash requirements in both the short-term and in the long-term; however, we continue to evaluate and take action, as necessary, to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure that our business can operate effectively during the current economic environment. We continue to monitor our discretionary spending across the organization (see Liquidity and Capital Resources included in this MD A). 
 
 Based on the length and severity of the fluctuating macroeconomic environment, including price volatility for our commodities, the possibility of a recession, changes in consumer shopping and consumption behavior, and changes in geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we may experience increasing supply chain costs, higher inflation and other impacts to our business. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential and evolving impacts on our business, consolidated results of operations, segment results, liquidity and capital resources.

 Results of Operations - Third Quarter 2024 vs. Third Quarter 2023 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales were 2,987.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3,030.0 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 42.5 million, or 1.4 . The net sales decrease was driven by a volume decline of approximately 3 , due to declines across our reportable segments, primarily in salty snack brands. Foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an unfavorable impact of less than 1 . The net sales decrease was partially offset by a favorable price realization of approximately 2 , driven by higher list prices across reportable segments. 
 For the purpose of correcting an inaccuracy in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024, with respect to second quarter 2024 performance, the North America Salty Snacks volume growth reported as approximately 9 should have stated approximately 11 , the North America Salty Snacks price decline reported as approximately 3 should have stated approximately 5 , the International volume declines reported as approximately 16 should have stated approximately 12 , and the International price increase reported as approximately 5 should have stated approximately 1 . As a result, the Total Consolidated volume decline reported as approximately 18 should have stated approximately 17 and the price increase reported as approximately 1 should have stated less than 1 . 
 Key U.S. Marketplace Metrics 
 For the third quarter of 2024, our total U.S. retail takeaway declined 1.4 in the expanded multi-outlet combined plus convenience store channels (Circana MULO + C-Stores), which includes candy, mint, gum, salty snacks and grocery items. Our U.S. candy, mint and gum CMG consumer takeaway declined 2.6 and experienced a CMG market share decline of 97 basis points. Our Salty consumer takeaway increased 2.8 in the third quarter of 2024 and experienced a Salty market share increase of 11 basis points. 
 
 Table of Contents 
 The Hershey Company | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | Page 37 

The CMG consumer takeaway and market share information reflects measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90 of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers, and convenience store channels, plus Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., partial dollar, club and military channels. These metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by Circana, the Company s market insights and analytics provider, and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category. 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 
 Cost of sales were 1,754.8 million in the third quarter 2024 compared to 1,669.7 million in the same period 2023, an increase of 85.1 million, or 5.1 . The increase was driven by 171.7 million of higher costs, primarily due to higher commodity costs from cocoa, higher supply chain costs, and incremental business realignment costs. The increase was partially offset by 71.4 million primarily related to lower sales volume, in line with the declines in net sales noted above. The increase was further offset by 15.2 million of favorable mark-to-market activity on our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years commodity purchases (See Part I, Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information). 
 Gross margin was 41.3 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 44.9 in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 360 basis points. The decrease was driven by unfavorable commodity costs, higher supply chain costs, unfavorable mix, and increased business realignment costs. The decrease was partially offset by lower sales volume. 
 SM A Expenses 
 SM A expenses were 591.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 624.4 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 32.5 million, or 5.2 . Total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses decreased 0.6 driven primarily by a decrease in the North America Confectionery segment, partially offset by an increase in North America Salty Snacks. SM A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, decreased 7.5 in the third quarter of 2024 driven by lower compensation costs across segments, partially offset by 20.0 million of incremental business realignment costs. 
 Business Realignment Activities 
 We periodically undertake business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business in support of our key growth strategies. Excluding the portion recorded within Cost of Sales and SM A expenses (as noted above), we recorded 27.6 million business realignment costs during the third quarter of 2024. There were no business realignments costs in the third quarter of 2023. The costs in 2024 related to the Advancing Agility Automation AAA Initiative, which commenced in 2024, focused on leveraging new technology to improve supply chain and manufacturing-related spend, and optimize selling, general and administrative expenses. Costs associated with business realignment activities are classified in our Consolidated Statements of Income as described in Note 9 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Operating Profit and Operating Profit Margin 
 Operating profit was 613.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 735.9 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 122.7 million, or 16.7 . The decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit and higher business realignment costs, partially offset by lower SM A expenses, as noted above. Operating profit margin decreased to 20.5 in 2024 from 24.3 in 2023 driven by the same factors noted above that resulted in lower gross margin for the period. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Net interest expense was 44.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 39.8 million in the same period of 2023, an increase of 4.5 million, or 11.5 . The increase was primarily due to higher short-term debt balances in 2024 versus 2023, specifically related to outstanding commercial paper and short-term foreign bank borrowings. 
 Other (Income) Expense, Net 
 Other (income) expense, net was 50.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 versus net expense of 42.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 7.4 million, or 17.1 . The increase in net expense was primarily driven by 11.6 million of higher write-downs on equity investments qualifying for tax credits in 2024 versus the third quarter of

 The Hershey Company | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | Page 38 

2023, partially offset by a decrease of 4.3 million of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost relating to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 
 Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate 
 The effective income tax rate was 14.0 for the third quarter of 2024 compared with 20.6 for the third quarter of 2023. Relative to the 21 statutory rate, the 2024 effective tax rate was primarily impacted by investment tax credits, partially offset by state taxes. Relative to the 21 statutory rate, the 2023 effective tax rate was impacted by investment tax credits, partially offset by state taxes and tax reserves. 
 Net Income and Earnings Per Share-diluted 
 Net income was 446.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 518.6 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 72.3 million, or 13.9 . EPS-diluted was 2.20 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.52 in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 0.32, or 12.7 . The decrease in both net income and EPS-diluted was driven by lower gross profit, higher business realignment costs and higher other income and expenses, partially offset by lower income taxes and lower SM A expenses. Our 2024 EPS-diluted benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding. 
 Results of Operations - First Nine Months 2024 vs. First Nine Months 2023 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales were 8,314.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 8,507.9 million during the same period of 2023, a decrease of 193.2 million, or 2.3 . The net sales decrease was driven by a volume decrease of approximately 5 , due to declines across our reportable segments. The net sales decrease was partially offset by a favorable price realization of approximately 3 , primarily due the North America Confectionery and International segments, partially offset by declines in North America Salty Snacks. There was no foreign currency exchange impact. 
 Key U.S. Marketplace Metrics 
 For the first nine months of 2024, our total U.S. retail takeaway decreased 0.1 in the expanded multi-outlet combined plus convenience store channels (IRI MULO + C-Stores), which includes candy, mint, gum, salty snacks and grocery items. Our U.S. CMG consumer takeaway declined 0.9 and experienced a CMG market share decline of 76 basis points. Our Salty consumer takeaway increased 3.2 and experienced a Salty market share increase of 7 basis points. 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 
 Cost of sales were 4,572.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 4,633.2 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 61.0 million, or 1.3 . The decrease was driven by 220.1 million of lower costs, primarily related to lower sales volume, in line with the declines in net sales noted above. The decrease was further driven by an incremental 191.7 million of favorable mark-to-market activity on our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years commodity purchases (See Part I, Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information). The decrease was partially offset by 350.8 million of higher costs, primarily driven by higher commodity costs from cocoa, higher supply chain costs, unfavorable mix and incremental business realignment costs. 
 Gross margin was 45.0 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 45.5 in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 50 basis points. The decrease was driven by higher commodity costs, higher supply chain costs, including higher logistics and labor costs, unfavorable product mix and increased business realignment costs. The decrease was partially offset by favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impact from commodity derivative instruments, favorable price realization and volume declines. 
 SM A Expenses 
 SM A expenses were 1,750.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1,777.8 million in the same period of 2023, an decrease of 26.9 million, or 1.5 . Total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses decreased 0.9 , driven by a decrease in North America Confectionery, partially offset by an increase in North America Salty Snacks. SM A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, decreased approximately 1.8 in the first nine months of 2024 driven by a decrease in compensation costs, partially offset by an

increase of 57.6 million of incremental business realignment costs, as well as higher investments in capabilities and technology. 
 Business Realignment Activities 
 We periodically undertake business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business in support of our key growth strategies. Excluding the portion recorded within Cost of Sales and SM A expenses (as noted above), we recorded business realignment costs of 32.6 million during the first nine months of 2024 versus 0.4 million in the first nine months of 2023. The costs in 2024 related to the AAA Initiative, which commenced in 2024, focused on leveraging new technology to improve supply chain and manufacturing-related spend, and optimize selling, general and administrative expenses. The costs in 2023 related to the International Optimization Program, which completed in 2023. The International Optimization Program was focused on optimizing our China operating model to improve our operational efficiency and provide for a strong, sustainable and simplified base going forward. Costs associated with business realignment activities are classified in our Consolidated Statements of Income as described in Note 9 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Operating Profit and Operating Profit Margin 
 Operating profit was 1,959.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2,096.5 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 137.5 million, or 6.6 . The decrease was predominantly due to lower gross profit and higher business realignment costs, partially offset by lower SM A expenses, as noted above. Operating profit margin decreased to 23.6 in the first nine months of 2024 from 24.6 in the same period in 2023 driven by the same factors that resulted in lower gross margin for the period. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Net interest expense was 125.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 114.1 million in the same period of 2023, an increase of 11.4 million, or 10.0 . The increase was primarily due to higher short-term debt balances in 2024 versus 2023, specifically related to outstanding commercial paper and short-term foreign bank borrowings. 
 Other (Income) Expense, Net 
 Other (income) expense, net was 82.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 versus a net expense of 130.2 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 47.5 million, or 36.5 . The decrease in net expense was primarily driven by 34.4 million of lower write-downs on equity investments qualifying for tax credits in 2024 versus the first nine months of 2023 and a decrease of 14.0 million of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs relating to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 
 Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate 
 Our effective income tax rate was 18.6 for the first nine months of 2024 compared with 18.3 for the first nine months of 2023. Relative to the 21 statutory rate, the 2024 effective tax rate was impacted by investment tax credits partially offset by state taxes. Relative to the 21 statutory rate, the 2023 effective tax rate was impacted by investment tax credits and employee share-based payments partially offset by state taxes and tax reserves. 
 Net Income and Earnings Per Share-diluted 
 Net income was 1,424.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1,512.7 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 88.1 million, or 5.8 . EPS-diluted was 7.00 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 7.36 in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 0.36, or 4.9 . The decrease in both net income and EPS-diluted was driven by lower gross profit and higher business realignment costs, partially offset lower other income and expenses, lower SM A and lower income taxes. Our 2024 EPS-diluted benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our Board-approved repurchase programs.

SEGMENT RESULTS 
 The summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our three reportable segments: North America Confectionery, North America Salty Snacks and International. For segment reporting purposes, we use segment income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance. These items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation. Segment income and segment income margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors, as they exclude the activities that are not directly attributable to our ongoing segment operations. 
 
 Our segment results, including a reconciliation to our consolidated results, were as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 In millions of dollars Net Sales: North America Confectionery 2,477.3 2,457.6 6,764.4 6,902.9 North America Salty Snacks 291.8 345.2 856.8 887.5 International 218.4 227.2 693.5 717.5 Total 2,987.5 3,030.0 8,314.7 8,507.9 Segment Income: North America Confectionery 724.8 847.5 2,137.5 2,392.4 North America Salty Snacks 54.0 57.4 144.9 147.9 International 14.2 31.7 82.0 127.8 Total segment income 793.0 936.6 2,364.4 2,668.1 Unallocated corporate expense (1) 161.8 199.3 496.2 563.0 Unallocated mark-to-market (gains) losses on commodity derivatives (2) (31.1) 1.8 (195.7) 5.2 Costs associated with business realignment activities 49.1 (0.4) 104.8 3.4 Operating profit 613.2 735.9 1,959.1 2,096.5 Interest expense, net 44.3 39.8 125.5 114.1 Other (income) expense, net 50.1 42.7 82.7 130.2 Income before income taxes 518.8 653.4 1,750.9 1,852.2

The decrease was driven by volume declines of approximately 17 , predominantly as a result of accelerated shipments in the third quarter of 2023 ahead of our ERP system implementation, which was completed in the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was partially offset by favorable price realization of approximately 2 , due to list price increases primarily in Dot s Homestyle Pretzels snacks. 
 Our North America Salty Snacks segment income was 54.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 57.4 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 3.4 million, or 5.9 .

The decrease reflects volume declines of approximately 3 , primarily related to SkinnyPop and Paqui snacks, as well as accelerated shipments ahead of our ERP system implementation in 2023, partially offset by volume growth in Dot s Homestyle Pretzels snacks. The decrease was further driven by an unfavorable price realization of less than 1 . 
 Our North America Salty Snacks segment income was 144.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 147.9 million the same period of 2023, a decrease 3 million, or 2.0 . The decrease was primarily due to volume declines, as noted above, and higher advertising and related consumer marketing costs. The decrease was partially offset by favorable commodity costs, lower supply chain costs, and favorable price realization. 
 International 
 The International segment includes all other countries where we currently manufacture, import, market, sell or distribute chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and other products. We currently have operations and manufacture product in Mexico, Brazil, India and Malaysia, primarily for consumers in these regions, and also distribute and sell confectionery products in export markets of Latin America, as well as Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa AMEA and other regions. International results, which accounted for 7.3 and 7.5 of our net sales for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Percent Change September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Percent Change In millions of dollars Net sales 218.4 227.2 (3.9) 693.5 717.5 (3.3) Segment income 14.2 31.7 (55.2) 82.0 127.8 (35.8) Segment margin 6.5 14.0 11.8 17.8

 Net sales of our International segment were 218.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 227.2 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease 8.8 million, or 3.9 . The decrease was due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 4 , primarily driven by Mexico and Brazil, and volume declines of approximately 1 across the segment, partially offset by growth in Europe and LATAM. The decrease was partially offset by favorable price realization of approximately 1 , primarily driven by Europe and Mexico. 
 Our International segment generated income of 14.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 31.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 17.5 million, or 55.2 , driven primarily by volume declines and higher commodity costs, partially offset by favorable price realization and lower supply chain costs. 
 Results of Operations - First Nine Months 2024 vs. First Nine Months 2023 
 Net sales of our International segment were 693.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 717.5 million the same period of 2023, a decrease 24.0 million, or 3.3 . The decrease was due to volume declines of approximately 6 across the segment, partially offset by growth in AMEA and Europe. The decrease was partially offset by favorable price realization of approximately 2 and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of less than 1 , primarily driven by Mexico. 
 Our International segment generated income of 82.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 127.8 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 45.8 million, or 35.8 , driven primarily by volume declines, increased commodity costs and unfavorable mix, partially offset by favorable price realization and lower supply chain costs. 
 Unallocated Corporate Expense 
 Unallocated corporate expense includes centrally-managed (a) corporate functional costs relating to legal, treasury, finance and human resources, (b) expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations, including warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, information systems and global shared services, (c) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (d) acquisition and integration-related costs and (e) other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, unallocated corporate expense totaled 161.8 million, as compared to 199.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 37.5 million, or 18.8 . The decrease was primarily driven by lower compensation costs, partially offset by higher acquisition and integration related costs. 
 In the first nine months of 2024, unallocated corporate expense totaled 496.2 million, as compared to 563.0 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 66.8 million, or 11.9 . The decrease was primarily driven by lower compensation costs and lower acquisition and integration related costs, partially offset by incremental investments in capabilities and technology. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Historically, our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations. Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which typically peak during the summer months, are generally met by utilizing cash on hand, bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper. Commercial paper may also be issued, from time to time, to finance ongoing business transactions, such as the repayment of long-term debt, business acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. 
 At September 29, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 615.0 million, an increase of 213.0 million compared to the 2023 year-end balance. Additional detail regarding the net uses of cash are outlined in the following discussion. Additionally, at September 29, 2024, we had outstanding short- and long-term debt totaling 5.3 billion, of which 904.8 million was classified as the current portion of long-term debt. Of the 904.8 million, 300 million of 2.050 Notes are due upon maturity on November 15, 2024, 300 million of 0.900 Notes are due upon maturity on June 1, 2025, and 300 million of 3.200 Notes are due upon maturity on August 21, 2025. We believe we can satisfy these debt obligations with cash generated from our operations, issuing new debt, and/or by borrowing on our unsecured credit facility. 
 Approximately 85 of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at September 29, 2024 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the United States. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is distributable to the United States without material tax implications, such as withholding tax. We intend to continue to reinvest the remainder of this balance outside of the United States for which there would be a material tax implication to distributing for the foreseeable future and, therefore, have not recognized additional tax expense on these earnings. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various short- and long-term cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures.

Cash Flow Summary 
 The following table is derived from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Nine Months Ended In millions of dollars September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,590.0 1,565.6 Investing activities (549.3) (735.5) Financing activities (847.0) (784.4) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 19.3 (38.3) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 213.0 7.4 
 Operating activities 
 We generated cash of 1,590.0 million from operating activities in the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 24.4 million compared to 1,565.6 million in the same period of 2023. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by the following factors: 
 In the aggregate, select net working capital items, specifically, trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, consumed cash of 183.9 million in 2024, compared to 449.6 million in 2023. This 265.7 million fluctuation was mainly driven by a decrease in cash used by accounts receivable due to a decrease in sales of everyday core U.S. confection brands, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of vendor and supplier payments, and lower inventory levels. 
 Timing of income tax payments contributed to an increase in operating cash of 138.5 million in 2024, compared to an increase of 83.2 million in 2023. This 55.3 million fluctuation was primarily due to the variance in actual tax expense for 2024 relative to the timing of quarterly estimated tax payments. We paid cash of 180.3 million for income taxes during 2024 compared to 264.5 million in the same period of 2023. 
 Other assets and liabilities consumed cash of 51.8 million in 2024, compared to 93.7 million in 2023. This 42.0 million fluctuation was primarily due to our 2023 purchase of an irrevocable group annuity contract to settle a portion of our post retirement benefit obligation, partially offset by the timing of certain prepaid expenses and other current assets. 
 The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the following net cash outflows: 
 Net income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, a write-down of equity investments, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and other charges) resulted in 349.5 million of lower cash flow in 2024 relative to 2023. 
 Investing activities 
 We used cash of 549.3 million for investing activities in the first nine months of 2024, a decrease of 186.2 million compared to 735.5 million in the same period of 2023. This decrease in net cash used in investing activities was mainly driven by the following factors: 
 Capital spending . Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, primarily to support our ERP system implementation, capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were 471.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 548.6 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease in our 2024 capital expenditures is largely driven by the wind down of our key strategic initiatives, including completion of the upgrade of a new ERP system across the enterprise in 2024. We expect 2024 capital expenditures, including capitalized software, to approximate 575 million to 600 million, a slight decrease from our previously estimated range of 600 million to 625 million. We intend to use our existing cash and internally generated funds to meet our 2024 capital requirements.

Investments in partnerships qualifying for tax credits . We make investments in partnership entities that in turn make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and renewable energy tax credits. We invested approximately 78.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 18.1 million in the same period of 2023. 
 Business Acquisition . In 2024, we had no acquisition activity. In May 2023, we acquired Weaver for a cash purchase price of 165.8 million. Further details regarding our business acquisition activity is provided in Note 2 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Other investing activities . In the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, our other investing activities were minimal. 
 Financing activities 
 We used cash of 847.0 million for financing activities in the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 62.6 million compared to 784.4 million in the same period of 2023. This increase in net cash used in financing activities was mainly driven by the following factors: 
 Short-term borrowings, net. In addition to utilizing cash on hand, we use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs. During the first nine months of 2024, we generated cash of 482.3 million predominately through the issuance of short-term commercial paper and an increase in short-term foreign bank borrowings. During the first nine months of 2023, we generated cash of 126.1 million predominately through the issuance of short-term commercial paper, as well as an increase in short-term foreign bank borrowings. 
 Long-term debt borrowings and repayments . During the first nine months of 2024, we had no long-term debt borrowings or repayments activity. During the first nine months of 2023, we issued 350 million of 4.250 Notes due in May 2028 and 400 million of 4.500 Notes due in May 2033 (the 2023 Notes ). Proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, net of discounts and issuance costs, totaled 744,092. Additionally, in May 2023 we repaid 250 million of 2.625 Notes and 500 million of 3.375 Notes due upon their maturity. 
 Dividend payments . Total dividend payments to holders of our Common Stock and Class B Common Stock were 814.3 million during the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 163.0 million compared to 651.3 million in the same period of 2023. Details regarding our 2024 cash dividends paid to stockholders are as follows:

 Share repurchases . We repurchase shares of Common Stock to offset the dilutive impact of treasury shares issued under our equity compensation plans. The value of these share repurchases in a given period varies based on the volume of stock options exercised and our market price. In addition, we periodically repurchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to Board-authorized programs intended to drive additional stockholder value. Details regarding our share repurchases are as follows:

 (1) In February 2023, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the Milton Hershey School Trust (the School Trust ), pursuant to which the Company purchased 1,000,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust at a price equal to 239.91 per share, for a total purchase price of 239.9 million. 
 (2) In July 2018, our Board of Directors approved a 500 million share repurchase authorization to repurchase shares of our Common Stock. As a result of the February 2023 Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, the July 2018 share repurchase authorization was completed. In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved an additional 500 million share repurchase authorization, which was completed as of March 31, 2024. In December 2023, our Board of Directors approved an additional 500 million share repurchase authorization. This program commenced after the existing May 2021 authorization was completed and is to be utilized at management s discretion. As a result of the share repurchase authorization, approximately 470 million remains available for repurchases under our December 2023 share repurchase authorization. We are authorized to purchase our outstanding shares in open market and privately negotiated transactions. The program has no expiration date and acquired shares of Common Stock will be held as treasury shares. Purchases under approved share repurchase authorizations are in addition to our practice of buying back shares sufficient to offset those issued under incentive compensation plans. 
 Proceeds from exercised stock options and employee tax withholding. During the first nine months of 2024, we received 13.8 million from employee exercises of stock options and paid 30.5 million of employee taxes withheld from share-based awards. During the first nine months of 2023, we received 24.3 million from employee exercises of stock options and paid 34.1 million of employee taxes withheld from share-based awards. Variances are driven primarily by the number of shares exercised and the share price at the date of grant.

Safe Harbor Statement 
 We are subject to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we note the following factors that, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations and assumptions that we have discussed directly or implied in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Many of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as anticipate, assume, believe, continue, estimate, expect, forecast, future, intend, plan, potential, predict, project, strategy, target and similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like could, may, might, should, will and would, among others. 
 
 The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to the following: 
 
 Our Company s reputation or brand image might be impacted as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, human and workplace rights, and other environmental, social or governance matters, which in turn could result in litigation or otherwise negatively impact our operating results; 
 
 Disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results; 
 
 We might not be able to hire, engage and retain the talented global human capital we need to drive our growth strategies; 
 
 Risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts, and increased focus and evolving views of our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders on climate change issues, could negatively affect our business and operations; 
 
 Increases in raw material and energy costs, along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials and our ability to successfully hedge against volatility in raw material pricing, could affect future financial results; 
 
 Price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity; 
 
 Market demand for new and existing products could decline; 
 
 Increased marketplace competition could hurt our business; 
 
 Our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures; 
 
 Our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations; 
 
 We may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs, which may have an adverse impact on our business; 
 
 Changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products; 
 
 Political, economic and/or financial market conditions, including impacts on our business arising from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could negatively impact our financial results; 

Table of Contents 
 The Hershey Company | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | Page 45 

Disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations; 
 
 Complications with the design, implementation or usage of our new enterprise resource planning system, including the ability to support post-implementation efforts and maintain enhancements, new features or modifications, could adversely impact our business and operations; and 
 
 Such other matters as discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ending March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in expectations or events or circumstances after the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed. 
 
 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The total amount of short-term debt, net of cash, amounted to net debt of 581.5 million and net debt of 317.9 million, at September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this variable-rate short-term debt as of September 29, 2024 would have changed interest expense by approximately 5.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 3.1 million for 2023. 
 We consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates on our remaining debt portfolio, excluding fixed-rate debt converted to variable rates with fixed-to-floating instruments, to be minimal since this debt is largely long-term and fixed-rate in nature. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt at September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by approximately 196 million and 203 million, respectively. However, since we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturities, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing or selling products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce fluctuations in our long or short currency positions relating primarily to purchase commitments or forecasted purchases for equipment, raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies. 
 The fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period. We estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. The potential decline in fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates of 10 was 32.1 million as of September 29, 2024 and 20.2 million as of December 31, 2023, generally offset by a reduction in foreign exchange associated with our transactional activities. 
 
 Commodities Price Risk Management and Derivative Contracts 
 We use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products, sugar, corn products, certain dairy products, wheat products, natural gas and diesel fuel primarily to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs within our supply chain. Significant changes impacting our commodity price risk management since our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K are described below. 

Table of Contents 
 The Hershey Company | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | Page 46 

Cocoa Products 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the average cocoa futures contract price was 3.32 per pound, with a trading range of 1.84 to 5.20 per pound, based on the Intercontinental Exchange futures contract. This average cocoa futures contract price represents an increase of approximately 123 compared to the 2023 annual average of 1.49 per pound. The production forecast for the 2024 2025 season is improving in Ghana and Ivory Coast, due to a combination of favorable weather conditions and decreased demand for cocoa; however, the price outlook for cocoa remains uncertain due to significant liquidity and volatility issues, which may have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices (including amount and duration thereof), premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times, and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and cocoa powder. We generally hedge commodity price risks for 3- to 24-month periods. As a result, the average market prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs. 
 Commodity Sensitivity Analysis 
 Our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of 149.6 million as of September 29, 2024 and 94.9 million as of December 31, 2023. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses by 4.8 million, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases. 
 For additional information about our market risks, see Item 7A under Part II of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 29, 2024 . Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 29, 2024 . 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we completed the process of our multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning ERP system, which replaced our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company s financial records, enhance operational functionality, and provide timely information to the Company s management team related to the operation of the business. During the third quarter of 2022, we completed the implementation of one operating segment that is included in our International segment. In July 2023, we completed the transition to our new consolidated financial reporting book of record. During October 2023, we completed the implementation of our new ERP system in the North America Salty Snacks segment. We completed the implementation of our new ERP system in the North America Confectionery segment and select operating segments included in our International segment in April 2024. The implementation of the new ERP system resulted in material changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has updated the internal controls as appropriate and will continue to monitor the impact of the implementation on our financial reporting business processes. There have been no changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 29, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 During the three months ended September 29, 2024, no shares of Common Stock were purchased in open market transactions in connection with our standing authorization to buy back shares sufficient to offset those issued under incentive compensation plans, which authorization does not have a dollar or share limit and is not included in our share repurchase authorizations described in the following paragraph. 
 In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 500 million share repurchase authorization, which was completed as of March 31, 2024. In December 2023, our Board of Directors approved an additional 500 million share repurchase authorization. This program commenced after the existing May 2021 authorization was completed and is to be utilized at management s discretion. As a result of the share repurchase authorization, approximately 470 million remains available for repurchases under our December 2023 share repurchase authorization. We are authorized to purchase our outstanding shares in open market and privately negotiated transactions. The program has no expiration date and acquired shares of Common Stock will be held as treasury shares. Purchases under approved share repurchase authorizations are in addition to our practice of buying back shares sufficient to offset those issued under incentive compensation plans.

Item 5. Other Information. 
 Director and Executive Officer Trading 
 A portion of our directors and officers compensation is in the form of equity awards and, from time to time, they may engage in open-market transactions with respect to their Company securities for diversification or other personal reasons. All such transactions in Company securities by directors and officers must comply with the Company s Insider Trading Policy, which requires that transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information.
