 . . The contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payer (Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges), and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare and Medicaid) or negotiated with (managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies) the third-party payers. The payment arrangements with third-party payers for the services we provide to the related patients typically specify payments at amounts less than our standard charges. Medicare generally pays for inpatient and outpatient services at prospectively determined rates based on clinical, diagnostic and other factors. Services provided to patients having Medicaid coverage are generally paid at prospectively determined rates per discharge, per identified service or per covered member. Agreements with commercial insurance carriers, managed care and preferred provider organizations generally provide for payments based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted fee-for-service rates. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we paid million to acquire a hospital facility in Texas and million to acquire nonhospital health care entities.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we received proceeds of million for the sale of a hospital facility in California and million related to sales of real estate and other health care entity investments. We recognized pretax gains of million for these transactions.

Our provisions for income taxes included tax benefits related to settlements of employee equity awards of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our gross unrecognized tax benefits were million, excluding accrued interest and penalties of million, as of September 30, 2024 million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023). Unrecognized tax benefits of million million as of December 31, 2023) would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. At September 30, 2024 , the Internal Revenue Service IRS was conducting examinations of the Company s 2016, 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and the 2019 returns of certain affiliates. We are also subject to examination by the IRS for tax years after 2019 as well as by state and foreign taxing authorities. Depending on the resolution of any federal, state and foreign tax disputes, the completion of examinations by federal, state or foreign taxing authorities, or the expiration of statutes of limitation for specific taxing jurisdictions, we believe it is reasonably possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. However, we are currently unable to estimate the range of any possible change.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Forward-Lookin g Statements This quarterly report on Form 10-Q includes certain disclosures that contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding expected capital expenditures, expected dividends, expected share repurchases, expected net claim payments, expected inflationary pressures, expected labor costs, expected hurricane-related expenses and losses of revenues and all other statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and can be identified by the use of words like may, believe, will, expect, project, estimate, anticipate, plan, initiative or continue. These forward-looking statements are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to a number of known and unknown uncertainties and risks, many of which are beyond our control, which could significantly affect current plans and expectations and our future financial position and results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to, (1) changes in or related to general economic conditions nationally and regionally in our markets, including inflation and economic and business conditions (and the impact thereof on the economy, financial markets and banking industry); changes in revenues due to declining patient volumes; changes in payer mix (including increases in uninsured and underinsured patients); potential increased expenses related to labor, supply chain or other expenditures;

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 
 Third Quarter 2024 Operations Summary Revenues increased to 17.487 billion in the third quarter of 2024 from 16.213 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled 1.270 billion, or 4.88 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.079 billion, or 3.91 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Third quarter results for 2024 include losses on sales of facilities of 4 million, or 0.02 per diluted share. All per diluted share disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 259.917 million shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 275.424 million shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 14.465 million shares and 13.059 million shares, respectively, of our common stock. Third quarter results for 2024 also included additional expenses and loss of revenues estimated at approximately 50 million, or 0.15 per diluted share, associated with the impact of Hurricane Helene on our Florida, Georgia and North Carolina facilities. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate ongoing additional expenses and loss of revenues of approximately 200 million to 300 million, or 0.60 to 0.90 per diluted share, due to Hurricane Helene s impact to our North Carolina facilities, as well as from Hurricane Milton, which impacted certain facilities in Florida during October. The impact to the third quarter of 2024 and estimates for the fourth quarter of 2024 do not include any insurance recoveries we may receive. Revenues increased 7.9 on a consolidated basis and 7.1 on a same facility basis for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in consolidated revenues can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.8 increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 5.0 increase in equivalent admissions. The same facility revenues increase primarily resulted from the combined impact of a 2.5 increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.5 increase in same facility equivalent admissions. We recorded revenues of 397 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the Florida Medicaid hospital directed payment program for the year ended September 30, 2023. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, consolidated admissions and same facility admissions both increased 4.5 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Surgeries declined 0.8 on both a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Emergency department visits increased 4.4 on a consolidated basis and 4.6 on a same facility basis during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Consolidated and same facility uninsured admissions declined 1.6 and 1.8 , respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Cash flows from operating activities increased 1.036 billion, from 2.479 billion for the third quarter of 2023 to 3.515 billion for the third quarter of 2024. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to positive changes in working capital items of 859 million, mainly from a decline in accounts receivable, and an increase in net income of 285 million, excluding the non-cash impact of gains and losses on sales of facilities and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase of 190 million in income tax payments. Results of Operations Revenue/Volume Trends Our revenues generally relate to contracts with patients in which our performance obligations are to provide health care services to the patients. Revenues are recorded during the period our obligations to provide health care services are satisfied. Our performance obligations for inpatient services are generally satisfied over periods that average approximately five days, and revenues are recognized based on charges incurred in relation to total expected charges. Our performance obligations for outpatient services are generally satisfied over a period of less than one day. The contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payer (Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges), and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare and Medicaid) or negotiated with (managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies) the third-party payers. The payment arrangements with third-party payers for the services we provide to the related patients typically specify payments at amounts less than our standard charges. Medicare generally pays for inpatient and outpatient services at prospectively determined rates based on clinical, diagnostic and other factors. Services provided to patients having Medicaid coverage are generally paid at prospectively determined rates per discharge, per identified service or

 Results of Operations (continued) Revenue/Volume Trends (continued) per covered member. Agreements with commercial insurance carriers, managed care and preferred provider organizations generally provide for payments based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted fee-for-service rates. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. Revenues increased 7.9 from 16.213 billion in the third quarter of 2023 to 17.487 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Our revenues are based upon the estimated amounts we expect to be entitled to receive from patients and third-party payers. Estimates of contractual adjustments under managed care and commercial insurance plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients and uninsured copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured and other discounts). We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record self-pay revenues at the estimated amounts we expect to collect. Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective care, who have income at or below 400 of the federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. Our revenues by primary third-party payer classification and other (including uninsured patients) for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

At September 30, 2024, we had 98 hospitals in the states of Texas and Florida. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, 59 of our admissions and 51 of our revenues were generated by these hospitals. Uninsured admissions in Texas and Florida represented 74 of our uninsured admissions during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 
 Results of Operations (continued) Revenue/Volume Trends (continued) We receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. Some state Medicaid programs use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS to implement Medicaid expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. We receive supplemental payments in several states. These supplemental payment programs are regularly reviewed by certain government agencies, and some states have made requests to CMS to modify their existing supplemental payment programs. In May 2024, CMS issued a final rule related to Medicaid managed care programs that addresses access, financing and quality within these programs. This final rule addresses aspects of state directed program arrangements with new and updated requirements to ensure a more consistent and transparent approach for participating states. The various elements of the rule take effect between issuance and early 2028. It is possible that these developments, reviews and requests will result in the restructuring of or other significant changes to supplemental payment programs. We are unable to estimate the financial impact that program structure modifications and other program changes, if any, may have on our results of operations. Key Performance Indicators We present certain metrics and statistical information that management uses when assessing our results of operations. We believe this information is useful to investors as it provides insight to how management evaluates operational performance and trends between reporting periods. Information on how these metrics and statistical information are defined is provided in the following tables summarizing operating results and operating data.

 (b) Equivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent admissions are computed by multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and gross outpatient revenues and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenues. The equivalent admissions computation equates outpatient revenues to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume, resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 
 Results of Operations (continued) Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenues increased to 17.487 billion in the third quarter of 2024 from 16.213 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled 1.270 billion, or 4.88 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.079 billion, or 3.91 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Third quarter results for 2024 include losses on sales of facilities of 4 million, or 0.02 per diluted share. All per diluted share disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 259.917 million shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 275.424 million shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 14.465 million shares and 13.059 million shares, respectively, of our common stock. Revenues increased 7.9 on a consolidated basis and 7.1 on a same facility basis for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in consolidated revenues can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.8 increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 5.0 increase in equivalent admissions. The same facility revenues increase primarily resulted from the combined impact of a 2.5 increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.5 increase in same facility equivalent admissions. Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 45.0 in the third quarter of 2024 and 46.6 in the third quarter of 2023. Salaries and benefits were favorably impacted by a 17.8 decline in contract labor during the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Salaries and benefits per equivalent admission declined 0.9 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Same facility salaries and benefits per full time equivalent increased 1.1 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. We continue to utilize certain contract, overtime and other premium rate labor costs to support our clinical staff and patients. While these costs have declined compared to the prior year period, future costs may be affected by labor market conditions and other factors. Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 15.2 in the third quarter of 2024 and 14.9 in the third quarter of 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 4.8 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 6.8 for medical devices, 1.6 for pharmacy supplies and 4.4 for general medical and surgical items in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 21.2 in the third quarter of 2024 and 20.8 in the third quarter of 2023. Other operating expenses is primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. The 0.4 increase in other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023, was primarily related to increased costs for professional fees and state provider fees in certain states, in addition to higher repairs and maintenance expense related to the response to Hurricane Helene at impacted hospitals, primarily in North Carolina. We have seen inflation have a negative impact on certain of these expenses and expect inflationary pressures will continue to impact operating expenses in the future. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were 157 million and 145 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Equity in earnings of affiliates was 15 million and 19 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Depreciation and amortization increased 73 million, from 769 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 842 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in depreciation relates primarily to capital expenditures at our existing facilities. Interest expense was 515 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 483 million in the third quarter of 2023. Our average debt balance was 41.846 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 38.881 billion for the third quarter of 2023. The average effective interest rate for our debt was 4.9 for both of the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, we recorded losses on sales of facilities of 4 million and gains on sales of facilities of 2 million, respectively. The effective tax rates were 25.0 and 24.8 for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 
 Results of Operations (continued) Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (continued) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from 196 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 212 million for the third quarter of 2024. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenues increased to 52.318 billion in the first nine months of 2024 from 47.665 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled 4.322 billion, or 16.37 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.635 billion, or 13.07 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Results for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 include gains on sales of facilities of 209 million, or 0.61 per diluted share, and losses on sales of facilities of 12 million, or 0.07 per diluted share, respectively. Our provision for income taxes for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 included tax benefits of 93 million, or 0.35 per diluted share, and 89 million, or 0.32 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. All per diluted share disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 263.987 million shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 278.173 million shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 14.465 million shares and 13.059 million shares, respectively, of our common stock. Revenues increased 9.8 on a consolidated basis and 8.6 on a same facility basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in consolidated revenues can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.6 increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 6.0 increase in equivalent admissions. The same facility revenues increase primarily resulted from the combined impact of a 3.5 increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.9 increase in same facility equivalent admissions. Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 44.4 in the first nine months of 2024 and 46.0 in the first nine months of 2023. Salaries and benefits were favorably impacted by a 21.9 decline in contract labor during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Salaries and benefits per equivalent admission increased 0.1 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023. Same facility salaries and benefits per full time equivalent increased 1.7 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023. We continue to utilize certain contract, overtime and other premium rate labor costs to support our clinical staff and patients. While these costs have declined compared to the prior year period, future costs may be affected by labor market conditions and other factors. Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 15.2 in the first nine months of 2024 and 15.4 in the first nine months of 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 2.7 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 4.3 for medical devices and 3.0 for general medical and surgical items and declined 2.1 for pharmacy supplies in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023. Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 21.0 in the first nine months of 2024 and 19.5 in the first nine months of 2023. Other operating expenses is primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. The 1.5 increase in other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023, was primarily related to increased costs for professional fees and state provider fees in certain states. We have seen inflation have a negative impact on certain of these expenses and expect inflationary pressures will continue to impact operating expenses in the future. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were 469 million and 433 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Equity in earnings of affiliates was 13 million and equity in losses of affiliates was 6 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Depreciation and amortization increased 168 million, from 2.288 billion in the first nine months of 2023 to 2.456 billion in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in depreciation relates primarily to capital expenditures at our existing facilities. 

 23 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 
 Results of Operations (continued) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (continued) Interest expense was 1.533 billion in the first nine months of 2024 and 1.447 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Our average debt balance was 40.901 billion for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 38.695 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The average effective interest rate for our debt was 5.0 for both of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we recorded gains on sales of facilities of 209 million and losses on sales of facilities of 12 million, respectively. The gain for 2024 was primarily related to the sale of a hospital facility in California. The effective tax rates were 24.7 and 23.7 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships. The increase in the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 is related primarily to adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Our provisions for income taxes for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 included tax benefits of 93 million and 89 million, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from 595 million for the first nine months of 2023 to 649 million for the first nine months 2024. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to the operations of one of our Texas markets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled 7.955 billion for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 6.757 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The 1.198 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities, for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, related primarily to an increase in net income of 798 million, excluding the non-cash impact of gains and losses on sales of facilities, depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation, and positive changes in working capital items of 547 million, mainly from a decline in inventories and other assets, partially offset by an increase in income tax payments of 416 million. The combination of interest payments and net income tax payments in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 totaled 2.891 billion and 2.530 billion, respectively. Working capital totaled 1.762 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2.272 billion at December 31, 2023 (decline was primarily due to the 2.258 billion increase in long-term debt due within one year, offset by a 1.953 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents). Cash used in investing activities was 3.587 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 3.720 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were 3.590 billion in the first nine months of 2024 and 3.585 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate 5 billion in 2024. At September 30, 2024, there were projects under construction which had estimated additional costs to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately 4.7 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds. Cash used in financing activities totaled 2.419 billion in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 3.055 billion in the first nine months of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, net cash flows used in financing activities included a net increase of 3.269 billion in our indebtedness, payment of dividends of 525 million, repurchase of common stock of 4.342 billion and distributions to noncontrolling interests of 530 million. During the first nine months of 2023, net cash flows used in financing activities included a net increase of 1.109 billion in our indebtedness, payment of dividends of 501 million, repurchase of common stock of 2.901 billion and distributions to noncontrolling interests of 497 million. During February 2024, we issued 4.500 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) 1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.450 senior notes due 2031 (the Existing 2031 Notes ), (ii) 1.300 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.600 senior notes due 2034, (iii) 1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.000 senior notes due 2054 and (iv) 700 million aggregate principal amount of 6.100 senior notes due 2064. We used the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. During March 2024, we repaid all of the 2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.000 senior notes due 2024 at maturity. 

 24 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During August 2024, we issued 3.000 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) 750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.450 senior notes due 2031 (the New 2031 Notes ), (ii) 1.250 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.450 senior notes due 2034 and (iii) 1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.950 senior notes due 2054. The New 2031 Notes represent a further issuance of our Existing 2031 Notes, issued during February 2024, and together with the New 2031 Notes, the aggregate principal amount of these notes is 1.750 billion. We used the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. We have significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled 42.965 billion at September 30, 2024. Our interest expense was 1.533 billion for the first nine months of 2024 and 1.447 billion for the first nine months of 2023. In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities 7.986 billion available as of both September 30, 2024 and October 28, 2024) and anticipated access to public and private debt markets. Investments of our insurance subsidiaries, held to maintain statutory equity levels and to provide liquidity to pay claims, totaled 648 million and 564 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. An insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of 120 million and 121 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our facilities are insured by our insurance subsidiary for losses up to 80 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is generally subject, in most cases, to a 15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. Additionally, the insurance subsidiary has entered into reinsurance contracts providing reimbursement for a certain portion of losses in excess of self-insured retentions. Net reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were 1.980 billion and 1.926 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate 547 million. We estimate that approximately 517 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention. Management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investment securities held by our insurance subsidiaries were recorded at 648 million at September 30, 2024. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses that are not credit-related being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2024, we had unrealized losses of 18 million on the insurance subsidiaries investments. We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities held by our insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize credit-related impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors. We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately 1.256 billion of our debt at September 30, 2024 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining debt balance of 41.709 billion at September 30, 2024 was subject to fixed rates of interest. Both the general level of interest rates and our leverage affect our variable interest rates. Our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. The average effective interest rate for our debt was 5.0 for both of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

 25 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Market Risk (continued) The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was 42.593 billion at September 30, 2024. The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately 13 million. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates. We are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. We currently do not consider the market risk related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or our liquidity. Tax Examinations At September 30, 2024, the Internal Revenue Service IRS was conducting examinations of the Company s 2016, 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and the 2019 returns for certain affiliates. We are also subject to examination by the IRS for tax years after 2019 as well as by state and foreign taxing authorities. Management believes HCA Healthcare, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities, and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
