 No adjustment on any one contract was material to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024, or October 1, 2023. 
 We have large, long-term contracts with the U.S. Navy for Virginia-class submarines and an international customer for tracked vehicles in which our estimates for contract revenue include variable consideration from anticipated contract modifications. For both contracts, it is reasonably possible that the actual amount of variable consideration realized could be less than our estimate, which could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations. 
 In addition, during the quarter the Navy was informed of deficiencies in welding procedures conducted by our teammate and subcontractor on our Columbia-class and Virginia-class submarine programs. It is reasonably possible that addressing these deficiencies could potentially impose costs or

 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a new global minimum tax of 15 on a country-by-country basis, with certain aspects intended to be effective on January 1, 2024, and other aspects on January 1, 2025. Although it is uncertain whether the U.S. will adopt any Pillar Two rules, some countries have enacted, introduced, or are considering implementing legislation. Because we generally do not have material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the proposed Pillar Two minimum, any legislation enacted consistent with the Pillar Two model rules is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

 or fewer days preceding delivery of the new aircraft to the customer. At that time, the customer is required to either exercise the option or allow its expiration. Other trade-in commitments are structured to guarantee a predetermined trade-in value. These commitments present more risk in the event of an adverse change in market conditions. In either case, any excess of the preestablished trade-in price above the fair market value at the time the new aircraft is delivered is treated as a reduction of revenue in the new-aircraft sales transaction. As of September 29, 2024, the estimated change in fair market values from the date of the commitments was not material.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 (Dollars in millions, except per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted) 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 General Dynamics is a global aerospace and defense company that offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; ship construction and repair; land combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; and technology products and services. 
 Our company is organized into four operating segments: Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems and Technologies. We refer to the latter three collectively as our defense segments. Our primary customer is the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense (DoD), the intelligence community and other U.S. government agencies. We also have significant business with non-U.S. governments and a diverse base of corporate and individual buyers of business jet aircraft and related services. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 
 With approximately 70 of our revenue from work for the U.S. government, government spending levels particularly defense spending influence our financial performance. The Congress has not yet passed a defense appropriations bill for the government s fiscal year 2025 even though the new year began on October 1, 2024. However, on September 26, 2024, a continuing resolution (CR) was signed into law, providing funding for federal agencies through December 20, 2024. When the government operates under a CR, all programs of record are funded at the prior year s appropriated levels until the current year appropriations bill is signed into law. Therefore, the DoD is prohibited from starting new programs or increasing funding on existing programs unless there is an exception for the program included in the CR. We do not anticipate the current CR having a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the impact to our business from an extended CR or government shutdown that may result from any continuing delay by Congress to pass a new defense appropriations bill is currently uncertain and would depend on the duration and government implementation of the CR or shutdown. For additional information, see the Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, in our most recent Form 10-K filing. 
 The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused significant disruptions to national and global economies and government activities, including supply chain and staffing challenges. Additionally, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions, export controls and other restrictions targeting Russia and Belarus. Lastly, the impact of the conflict in the Middle East continues to evolve. The disruptions caused by these events continue to impact global economies and businesses. The primary impact to our business is supply chain challenges, including inflationary pressures. 
 28 

In our Aerospace segment, supply chain challenges have paced our ability to ramp up production at the rate we would have liked, in response to strong customer demand for our aircraft and have caused out-of-sequence manufacturing, which increases costs and decreases operational efficiency. In addition, the conflict in the Middle East has impacted the delivery schedule for our Israel-based supplier of mid-cabin aircraft. Within our defense segments, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in supply chain challenges that continue to impact our Marine Systems segment. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and increased threat environment have created additional demand for certain of our products and services, particularly in our Combat Systems segment. 
 Earlier this year, our ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G700 aircraft received U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) type certification, which paved the way for customer deliveries in the second quarter of 2024. Deliveries were impacted in the third quarter by late supply chain deliveries, additional type certification procedures due to complex interiors, a quality escape from a vendor that was identified and rectified and timing of regional weather events. These impacts are largely behind us and we expect to deliver about 42 G700 aircraft in all this year. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 The following paragraphs explain how we recognize revenue and operating costs in our operating segments and the terminology we use to describe our operating results. 
 In the Aerospace segment, we record revenue on contracts for new aircraft when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft. Revenue associated with the segment s services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Fluctuations in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries, and the level and type of aircraft services performed during the period. 
 The majority of the Aerospace segment s operating costs relates to new aircraft production on firm orders and consists of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots, recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace segment s services businesses are recognized generally as incurred. 
 For new aircraft, operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of ultra-large-cabin, large-cabin and mid-cabin aircraft deliveries. Aircraft mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our aircraft models. A new aircraft model typically has lower margins in its initial production lots, and then margins generally increase as we realize efficiencies in the production process. Additional factors affecting the segment s earnings and margin include the volume, mix and profitability of services work performed, the market for pre-owned aircraft, and the level of general and administrative (G A) and net research and development (R D) costs incurred by the segment. 
 29 

In the defense segments, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized generally over time as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G A expenses. Variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts. Because costs are used as a measure of progress, year-over-year variances in costs result in corresponding variances in revenue, which we generally refer to as volume. 
 Operating earnings and margin in the defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the estimated costs to complete the contract or both. Therefore, changes in costs incurred in the period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability. It is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value (or vice versa) that the profitability of that contract may be impacted. Contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher- versus lower-margin work. Higher or lower margins can result from a number of factors, including contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) and type of work (e.g., development/production). Contract mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our long-term production contracts. New long-term production contracts typically have lower margins initially, and then margins generally increase as we achieve learning curve improvements or realize other cost reductions.

 Operating Results 
 The increase in the Aerospace segment s revenue in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 consisted of the following: 
 Third Quarter Nine Months Aircraft manufacturing 315 1,299 Aircraft services 135 330 Total increase 450 1,629 
 Aircraft manufacturing revenue increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 due primarily to the number and mix of aircraft deliveries, including initial deliveries of our ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G700 aircraft. Aircraft services revenue was up in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 due to increased customer demand for aircraft maintenance based on established maintenance cycles, a larger installed base and customer flight activity. 
 31 

The increase in the segment s operating earnings in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 consisted of the following: 
 Third Quarter Nine Months Aircraft services 53 105 Aircraft manufacturing (5) 76 G A/other expenses (11) (35) Total increase 37 146 
 Aircraft services operating earnings increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 due to higher volume. Although aircraft manufacturing revenue increased in 2024, operating earnings have not increased at the same rate, reflecting additional costs associated with the first lot of G700 aircraft and out of station work caused by late supply chain deliveries. G A/other expenses have increased in 2024 due in part to the R D efforts supporting the extended FAA certification processes. In total, the Aerospace segment s operating margin decreased 90 basis points in the third quarter and 80 basis points in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the prior-year periods. 
 2024 Outlook 
 We expect the Aerospace segment s 2024 revenue to be approximately 12.3 billion, with operating margin of approximately 13.2 .

 G A EXPENSES 
 As a percentage of revenue, G A expenses decreased to 5.5 in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 5.9 in the first nine months of 2023. We expect G A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2024 to be generally consistent with 2023. 
 OTHER, NET 
 Net other income was 47 in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 65 in the first nine months of 2023, and represents primarily the non-service components of pension and other post-retirement benefits. In 2024, we expect net other income to be approximately 60. 
 INTEREST, NET 
 Net interest expense was 248 in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 265 in the prior-year period, reflecting the repayment of our scheduled debt maturities in 2023. See Note H to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1, for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including interest rates. We expect 2024 net interest expense to be approximately 320. 
 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX, NET 
 Our effective tax rate was 17.0 in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 16.2 in the prior-year period. For 2024, based on increased U.S. and foreign tax credits, tax benefits from equity-based compensation and other timing items, we anticipate a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 17.0 . 

BACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE 
 Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was 92.6 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared with 91.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. Our total backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts with customers as discussed in Note B to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. Our total estimated contract value, which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value, was 137.6 billion on September 29, 2024. 
 36 

The following table details the backlog and estimated potential contract value of each segment at the end of the third and second quarters of 2024: 
 Funded Unfunded Total Backlog Estimated Potential Contract Value Total Estimated Contract Value September 29, 2024 Aerospace 18,859 937 19,796 254 20,050 Marine Systems 29,008 11,463 40,471 9,578 50,049 Combat Systems 17,289 682 17,971 8,016 25,987 Technologies 9,794 4,602 14,396 27,093 41,489 Total 74,950 17,684 92,634 44,941 137,575 June 30, 2024 Aerospace 19,126 911 20,037 372 20,409 Marine Systems 29,912 11,436 41,348 3,983 45,331 Combat Systems 16,003 673 16,676 5,816 22,492 Technologies 9,365 3,875 13,240 28,283 41,523 Total 74,406 16,895 91,301 38,454 129,755 

AEROSPACE 
 Aerospace funded backlog represents primarily new aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers. Unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Aerospace segment ended the third quarter of 2024 with backlog of 19.8 billion. 
 Orders for new Gulfstream aircraft reflected strong demand, yielding a segment book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenue) of 1-to-1 for the first nine months of 2024, even as revenue grew by nearly 30 year over year. 
 Beyond total backlog, estimated potential contract value represents primarily options and other agreements with existing customers to purchase new aircraft and long-term aircraft services agreements. On September 29, 2024, estimated potential contract value in the Aerospace segment was 254. 

DEFENSE SEGMENTS 
 The total backlog in our defense segments represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of total backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the U.S. Congress and funded by customers, as well as commitments by international customers that are approved and funded similarly by their governments. The unfunded portion of total backlog includes the amounts we believe are likely to be funded, but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide the same funding level currently anticipated for a given program. 
 Estimated potential contract value in our defense segments includes unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts and unfunded work on indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Contract options represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option 
 37 

and establishes a firm order. For IDIQ contracts, we evaluate the amount of funding we expect to receive and include this amount in our estimated potential contract value. This amount is often less than the total IDIQ contract value, particularly when the contract has multiple awardees. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value. 
 Total backlog in our defense segments was 72.8 billion on September 29, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the Combat Systems and Technologies segments achieved book-to-bill ratios of 1.5-to-1 and 1.3-to-1, respectively. Overall, the total book-to-bill ratio in our defense segments was 1.1-to-1 in the third quarter of 2024. Estimated potential contract value in our defense segments was 44.7 billion on September 29, 2024. We received the following significant contract awards during the third quarter of 2024: 
 MARINE SYSTEMS 
 780 from the U.S. Navy for the construction of an additional John Lewis-class (T-AO-205) fleet replenishment oiler. The contract including options for an additional seven T-AO-205 oilers has a maximum potential value of more than 6.7 billion. 
 1.5 billion from the Navy for long-lead materials for Block VI Virginia-class submarines. 
 100 from the Navy to provide engineering, technical, design and planning yard support services for operational strategic and attack submarines. 
 85 from the Navy for maintenance and modernization on the USS Chung-Hoon, an Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided missile destroyer. 
 80 for advanced nuclear plant studies (ANPS) in support of the Columbia-class submarine program for the Navy. 
 COMBAT SYSTEMS 
 885 for various munitions and ordnance. These contracts have a maximum potential value of 1.7 billion. 
 465 for two contracts from the U.S. Army for the production of 155mm artillery projectile metal parts. These contracts have a maximum potential value of 1.7 billion. 
 395 from the Army for the production of 155mm propelling bag charges. 
 190 from the Army to produce Iron Fist Active Protection System kits. 
 180 from the Army to produce Stryker Sgt. Stout vehicles. 
 100 from the Army for long-lead materials to support the future retrofit of Stryker Sgt. Stout vehicles to a dual Stinger Vehicle Universal Launcher (SVUL) configuration. 
 TECHNOLOGIES 
 840 for several key contracts for classified customers. These contracts have a maximum potential value of 1 billion. 
 605 for multiple awards from the U.S. Space Development Agency to develop and integrate ground systems for the low-Earth orbit satellite network. 
 38 

105 from the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to continue operating and maintaining Pentagon and regional government-furnished network infrastructures. The contract including options has a maximum potential value of 300. 
 185 from the U.S. Department of State (DoS) to manage its global technical security supply chain. 
 135 to provide equipment and tools to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to augment its High-Performance Computing Systems. 
 130 from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) to provide hybrid cloud services and IT design, engineering, and operations and sustainment services. 
 120 from the DoS to provide overseas consular services to support visa application and issuance at U.S. embassies and consulates throughout the world under the Global Support Strategy (GSS) program. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation, which is underpinned by an operating discipline focused on cost control and working capital management. This emphasis gives us the flexibility for prudent capital deployment, while allowing us to step down debt over time, and preserves a strong balance sheet for future opportunities. 
 We evaluate a variety of capital deployment options based on current market conditions and our long-term outlook, and we believe agility is a key component of our capital deployment strategy as market conditions change over time. Our capital deployment priorities include investments in our products and services to drive long-term growth, a predictable dividend, strategic acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases. 
 We believe cash generated by operating activities, supplemented by commercial paper issuances, is sufficient to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs. An additional potential source of capital is the issuance of long-term debt in capital market transactions. 
 We ended the third quarter of 2024 with a cash and equivalents balance of 2.1 billion compared with 1.9 billion at the end of 2023. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in Part I, Item 1: 
 Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,952 3,514 Net cash used by investing activities (588) (608) Net cash used by financing activities (1,173) (2,792) 
 
 OPERATING ACTIVITIES 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 2 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 3.5 billion in the same period in 2023. The primary driver of cash flows in both periods was net earnings. Cash flows in the first nine months of 2024 were affected negatively by growth in operating working capital, particularly driven by the ramp-up in production of new Gulfstream aircraft models in our Aerospace segment and timing in our Combat Systems segment. Cash flows in the first nine months of 
 39 

2023 were affected positively by a decrease in unbilled receivables due to the receipt of progress payments on large international vehicle contracts in our Combat Systems segment and an increase in customer deposits driven by Gulfstream aircraft orders, offset partially by an increase in inventory due primarily to the ramp-up in production of new Gulfstream aircraft models. 
 
 INVESTING ACTIVITIES 
 Cash used by investing activities was 588 in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 608 in the same period in 2023. Our investing activities include cash paid for capital expenditures and business acquisitions; purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities; and proceeds from asset sales. The primary use of cash for investing activities in both periods was capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were 561 in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 600 in the same period in 2023. 
 
 FINANCING ACTIVITIES 
 Cash used by financing activities was 1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 2.8 billion in the same period in 2023. Financing activities include the use of cash for repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends, and debt and commercial paper repayments. Our financing activities also include proceeds received from debt and commercial paper issuances and employee stock option exercises. 
 On March 6, 2024, our board of directors (Board) declared an increased quarterly dividend of 1.42 per share, the 27th consecutive annual increase. Previously, the Board had increased the quarterly dividend to 1.32 per share in March 2023. Cash dividends paid were 1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. 
 We paid 183 and 434 in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, to repurchase our outstanding shares. On September 29, 2024, 4 million shares remained authorized by our Board for repurchase, representing 1.5 of our total shares outstanding. 
 Fixed-rate notes of 500 mature in November 2024. We currently plan to repay these notes at maturity using cash on hand. For additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates, see Note H to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. 
 On September 29, 2024, we had no commercial paper outstanding, but we maintain the ability to access the commercial paper market in the future. Separately, we have a 4 billion committed bank credit facility for general corporate purposes and working capital needs and to support our commercial paper issuances. We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows us to access the debt markets. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE - FREE CASH FLOW 
 We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. As described below, we use free cash flow to measure our performance in these areas. While we believe this metric provides useful information, it is not a defined operating measure under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and there are limitations associated with its use. Our calculation of this metric may not be completely comparable to similarly 
 40 

titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of this metric should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP measures. 
 We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles free cash flow with net cash from operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in Part I, Item 1: 
 Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,952 3,514 Capital expenditures (561) (600) Free cash flow 1,391 2,914 Cash flows as a percentage of net earnings: Net cash provided by operating activities 74 152 Free cash flow 53 126 

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES 
 For a discussion of environmental matters and other contingencies, see Note J to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. Except as otherwise noted in Note J, we do not expect our aggregate liability with respect to these matters to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We employ judgment in making our estimates, but they are based on historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts our results of operations for all periods presented. 
 Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. We review and update our contract-related estimates regularly. We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. The aggregate impact of adjustments in 
 41 

contract estimates decreased our operating earnings (and diluted earnings per share) by 12 0.03) for the three-month period ended September 29, 2024, and increased our operating earnings (and diluted earnings per share) by 101 0.29) for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2024, and 11 0.03) and 98 0.28) for the three- and nine-month periods ended October 1, 2023, respectively. No adjustment on any one contract was material to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024, or October 1, 2023. 
 Other critical accounting policies and estimates include long-lived assets and goodwill, commitments and contingencies, and retirement plans. For a full discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 The outstanding notes described in Note H to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1, issued by General Dynamics Corporation (the parent), are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured, joint and several basis by several of the parent s 100 -owned subsidiaries (the guarantors). The guarantee of each guarantor ranks equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of such guarantor. A listing of the guarantors is included in an exhibit to this Form 10-Q. 
 Because the parent is a holding company, its cash flow and ability to service its debt, including the outstanding notes, depends on the performance of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to distribute cash to the parent, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the outstanding notes have a direct claim only against the parent and the guarantors. 
 Under the relevant indenture, the guarantee of each guarantor is limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without rendering the guarantee voidable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. Each indenture also provides that, in the event (1) of a merger, consolidation or sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a guarantor (other than a transaction with the parent or any of its subsidiaries) or (2) there occurs a transfer, sale or other disposition of the voting stock of a guarantor so that the guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of the parent, then the guarantor or the entity acquiring the assets (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a guarantor) will be released and relieved of any obligations under the guarantee. 
 The following summarized financial information presents the parent and guarantors (collectively, the combined obligor group) on a combined basis. The summarized financial information of the combined obligor group excludes net investment in and earnings of subsidiaries related to interests held by the combined obligor group in subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes.

These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve factors, risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These factors include, among others: 
 general U.S. and international political and economic conditions;

 termination of government contracts due to unilateral government action; 
 differences in anticipated and actual program performance, including the ability to perform within estimated costs, and performance issues with key suppliers; 
 expected recovery on contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment; 
 changing customer demand for business aircraft, including the effects of economic conditions on the business-aircraft market; 
 changing prices for energy and raw materials; 
 the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or other similar outbreaks; 
 the status or outcome of legal and/or regulatory proceedings; 
 potential effects of audits and reviews by government agencies of our government contract performance, compliance and internal control systems and policies; 
 cybersecurity events and other disruptions; 
 risks and uncertainties relating to our acquisitions and joint ventures; and 
 potential for increased regulation related to global climate change. 
 All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to General Dynamics or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section. We do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report. These factors may be revised or supplemented in future SEC filings.
