The Company s effective tax rate was and for the three month period ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense for the three month period ended October 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the previous year is due primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance in the current period.

The Company recognizes a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Given the Company s recent operating losses and going concern uncertainty identified in the current quarter, the Company determined that it may not reasonably rely on future forecasted income to benefit its deferred assets. For these reasons the Company has established a full valuation allowance on its deferred assets as of the end of the current quarter.

to years. At contract inception, the Company reviews the facts and circumstances of the arrangement to determine if the contract is or contains a lease. The Company follows the guidance in Topic 842 to evaluate whether the contract has an identified asset; if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset; and if the Company has the right to direct the use of the underlying asset. When determining if a contract has an identified asset, the Company considers both explicit and implicit assets, and whether the supplier has the right to substitute the asset. When determining if the Company has the right to direct the use of an underlying asset, the Company considers if it has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use and if it controls the decision-making rights over the asset. The Company s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The Company exercises judgment to determine the term of those leases when extension or termination options are present and includes such options in the calculation of the lease term when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. The Company has elected to include both lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease payments. Payments made to a lessor for items such as taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, or other costs commonly referred to as executory costs, are also included in lease payments if they are fixed. The fixed portion of these payments are included in the calculation of the lease liability, while any variable portion would be recognized as variable lease expenses, when

Overview: The Company currently operates in one reportable segment as an independent provider of electronic manufacturing services EMS and provides manufacturing and assembly services ranging from the assembly of individual components to the assembly and testing of box-build electronic products. The Company has the ability to produce assemblies requiring mechanical as well as electronic capabilities. This includes printed circuit board assemblies, electro-mechanical subassemblies and completely assembled (box-build) electronic products. The Company relies on numerous third-party suppliers for components used in the Company s production process. Certain of these components are available only from single-sources or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, a customer s specifications may require the Company to obtain components from a single-source or a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the Company s results of operations. Further, the Company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from suppliers. The Company does not enter into long-term purchase agreements with major or single-source suppliers. The Company believes that short-term purchase orders with its suppliers provides flexibility, given that the Company s orders are based on the changing needs of its customers. In connection with the production of assembled products, the Company provides services to its customers, including (1) automatic and manual assembly and testing of products; (2) material sourcing and procurement; (3) manufacturing and test engineering support; (4) design services; (5) warehousing and distribution services; (6) assistance in obtaining product approval from governmental and other regulatory bodies and (7) compliance reporting. The Company provides these manufacturing services through an international network of facilities located in the United States, Mexico, China, Vietnam and Taiwan. Sales can be a misleading indicator of the Company s financial performance. Sales levels can vary considerably among customers and products depending on the type of services (turnkey versus consignment) rendered by the Company and the demand by customers. Consignment orders require the Company to perform manufacturing services on components and other materials supplied by a customer, and the Company charges only for its labor, overhead and manufacturing costs, plus a profit. In the case of turnkey orders, the Company provides, in addition to manufacturing services, the components and other materials used in assembly. Turnkey contracts, in general, have a higher dollar volume of sales for each given assembly, owing to inclusion of the cost of components and other materials in net sales and cost of goods sold. Variations in the number of turnkey orders compared to consignment orders can lead to significant fluctuations in the Company s revenue and gross margin levels. Consignment orders accounted for less than 1 of the Company s revenues for the three and six month periods ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023. The Company s international footprint provides our customers with flexibility within the Company to manufacture in China, Mexico, Vietnam or the U.S. We believe this strategy will continue to serve the Company well as its customers continuously evaluate their supply chain strategies. Despite supply chain component shortages improving in fiscal 2024, the Company s business, results of operations, and financial condition continue to be adversely affected by certain supply chain issues due to world-wide component shortages. The Company anticipates continuing improvement in supply chain predictability in fiscal 2025.

Results of Operations: The following table sets forth the Company s consolidated results of operations, including the percentage relationships of gross profit and expense items to net sales for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended October 31, October 31, 2024 2023 Net sales 74,719,360 98,691,684 Cost of products sold 67,815,156 89,003,929 As a percent of net sales 90.8 90.2 Gross profit 6,904,204 9,687,755 As a percent of net sales 9.2 9.8 Selling and administrative expenses 6,370,511 6,613,634 As a percent of net sales 8.5 6.7 Operating income 533,693 3,074,121 Other income - 6,503 Change in fair value of warrants (626,000) - Interest expense, net (4,701,108) (2,708,696) (Loss) income before income taxes (4,793,415) 371,928 Income tax expense (4,673,254) (343,666) Net (loss)/income (9,466,669) 28,262 
 Net Sales Net sales decreased 23,972,324, or -24.3 , to 74,719,360 for the three month period ended October 31, 2024, compared to 98,691,684 for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The Company s sales decreased for the three month period ended October 31, 2024, in the consumer electronics, industrial electronics and medical/life science markets. The decrease in sales is primarily due to customers that have lowered their demand in the current quarter, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Costs of products sold Cost of products sold decreased 21,188,773, or -23.8 , to 67,815,156 (90.8 of net sales) for the three month period ended October 31, 2024, compared to 89,003,929 (90.2 of net sales) for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of sales is primarily due to lower sales volumes, higher labor costs and other fixed manufacturing costs for the three month period ended October 31, 2024, than in the same period in the prior fiscal year. The three month period ended October 31, 2024 includes approximately 300,000 of severance related to staff reductions during the period. Gross profit margin Gross profit margin was 9.2 of net sales, for the three month period ended October 31, 2024, compared to 9.8 for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross margins as a percentage of sales is primarily due to lower sales volumes, higher labor and other fixed manufacturing costs, and severance related expenses during the three month period ended October 31, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.

Selling and administrative expenses Selling and administrative expenses decreased 243,123, or -3.7 to 6,370,511 (8.5 of net sales) for the three month period ended October 31, 2024, compared to 6,613,634 (6.7 of net sales) for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses is primarily due to a decrease in bonus expense. Change in fair value of warrants Warrants were issued at a valuation of 2,263,000 during the quarter using a Monte Carlo model with a subsequent change in the fair value of warrants increasing expense by 626,000 for a net value as of October 31, 2024 of 2,889,000 in connection with the TCW Amendment which included the obligation to issue warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock. The valuation was based on the actual number of warrants that can be issued under this amendment using the Monte Carlo model subject to remeasurement until warrants are exercised or cancelled. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net, increased to 4,701,108 for the three month period ended October 31, 2024, compared to 2,708,696 for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The increase relates to an expense of deferred financing costs as required by the August debt modification. Income tax expense Income tax expense increased 4,329,588 to 4,673,254 for the three month period ended October 31, 2024, compared to 343,666 for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The Company s effective tax rate was (61.46) and 92.40 for the three month period ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense for the three month period ended October 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the previous year is due primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance in the current period. The change in effective tax rate is due to variations in income earned by jurisdiction and the recording of valuation allowance. Net income/loss Net income decreased 9,494,931, to a net loss of 9,466,669 for the three month period ended October 31, 2024, compared to a net income of 28,262 for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in net income primarily relates to lower sales volumes, a warrant remeasurement, deferred financing costs related to debt modification, higher labor and other fixed manufacturing costs and severance related costs partially offset with lower selling and administrative expenses and lower interest expense.

Liquidity and Capital Resources: The Company s financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Over the past two years the Company has been in violation of financial covenants in its credit agreements (further discussion in Note E Long-term Debt). Pursuant to amendments to those credit agreements, the Company must satisfy revised terms to those agreements, including the requirement to pursue and close a Replacement Transaction to pay the Obligations (as defined in the 

 36 
 SigmaTron International, Inc. October 31, 2024 

Credit Agreements) in full no later than September 30, 2025 unless the Company meets certain debt ratios for the twelve month period ending on August 31, 2025. In addition, there is a risk of additional covenant failures based on current revenue levels. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company having adequate capital to fund its operating plan and performance. Management s plans to continue as a going concern may include raising additional capital through sales of equity securities and borrowing, focusing the Company on its most profitable elements, and exploring alternative funding sources on an as needed basis. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing its plans. The COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures and the broader business climate in its industry have negatively impacted the Company s business operations and is expected to continue to do so and, these impacts may include reduced access to capital. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern may be dependent upon its ability to successfully secure other sources of financing and sustain profitable operations. The Company is obligated by its lenders to execute a Replacement Transaction by September 2025. Due to this requirement, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. While the Company expects to refinance under commercially reasonable terms there can be no guarantee of success. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company has reduced its debt by selling assets, reducing workforce, and reducing its working capital requirements. The Company is exploring additional activities designed to further reduce its debt load and improve operating performance. Subsequent to October 31, 2024, during December 2024, the Company executed a sale/leaseback transaction with respect to its Elk Grove Village, Illinois headquarters, using the proceeds to further reduce its debt position. The Company s primary sources of liquidity have traditionally been comprised of cash and cash equivalents as well as availability under credit agreements in place at the time. The Company is obligated to either meet certain debt ratios by August 31, 2025 or find a Replacement Transaction no later than September 30, 2025. While the Company expects to have sufficient financial resources available on acceptable terms, there can be no assurance this will occur, particularly in light of increasingly conservative financial markets. The Company continues to explore other strategic initiatives to further reduce its debt to enable it to comply with increasingly stringent financial covenants. Delays or a failure to effectively reduce debt, including due to circumstances outside of our control, could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. In the event customers delay orders or future payments are not made timely, economic conditions remain impacted for longer than the Company expects or deteriorate further, the Company experiences continued supply chain disruptions on certain raw materials, the Company desires to expand its operations, its business grows more rapidly than expected, the Company fails to effectively reduce debt, any new public health crises arise, or geopolitical risks continue or worsen , the Company s liquidity position could be severely impacted and additional financing resources may be necessary. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain equity or debt financing at acceptable terms, or at all, in the future. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to retain or renew its credit agreements in the future, or that any retention or renewal will be on the same terms as currently exist.

Operating Activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was 12,931,640 for the six months ended October 31, 2024, compared to cash flow provided by operating activities of 15,766,616 for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily the result of a decrease in inventory in the amount of 12,798,326, an increase in operating lease liabilities in the amount of 2,664,870, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets in the amount of 1,774,858 and a decrease in accounts receivable in the amount of 1,526,593. Cash flow from operating activities was offset by an increase in right-of-use assets in the amount of 2,627,211, a decrease in customer deposits in the amount of 2,565,383 and a decrease in accounts payable in the amount of 2,489,427. The decrease in inventory is the result of improvement in the component marketplace which has allowed the Company to complete assemblies for shipping. The decrease in accounts payable is a result of lower accounts payable balances due to lower purchases of raw materials and the timing of payments. The decrease in accounts receivable is a result of lower accounts receivable balances due to lower volumes during the six months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Cash flow provided by operating activities was 15,766,616 for the six months ended October 31, 2023.

The Facility, as amended, allowed the Company to borrow on a revolving basis up to the lesser of (i) 70,000,000 or (ii) an amount equal to a percentage of the eligible receivable borrowing base plus a percentage of the inventory borrowing base minus any reserves established by Lender (the Revolving Commitment ). The maturity date of the Facility is July 18, 2027. The Credit Agreements contain financial covenants relating to (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreements), which is the ratio of the Company s fixed payments on its indebtedness made during any fiscal period minus non-financed capital expenditures to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreements) and (ii) the Total Debt to EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreements), which is the ratio of the Company s borrowed money or letters of credit to EBITDA. In addition, the JPM Credit Agreement imposes a cash dominion period if there is an event of default or if availability is less than 10 of the Revolving Commitment (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement), and such requirement continues until there is no event of default and availability is greater than 10 of the Revolving Commitment, in each case for 30 consecutive days. In connection with the entry into the JPM Credit Agreement, Lender and TCW, as administrative agent under the Term Loan Agreement, entered into the Intercreditor Agreement, dated July 18, 2022, and acknowledged by SigmaTron and Wagz (the ICA ), to set forth and govern the lenders respective lien priorities, rights and remedies under the JPM Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement. Th e facility under the JPM Credit Agreement is secured by: (a) a first priority security interest in SigmaTron s (i) accounts receivable and inventory (excluding Term Priority Mexican Inventory (as defined in the ICA) and certain inventory in transit, (ii) deposit accounts, (iii) proceeds of business interruption insurance that constitute ABL BI Insurance Share (as defined in the ICA), (iv) certain other property, including payment intangibles, instruments, equipment, software and hardware and similar systems, books and records, to the extent related to the foregoing, and (v) all proceeds of the foregoing, in each case, now owned or hereafter acquired (collectively, the ABL Priority Collateral and (b) a second priority security interest in Term Priority Collateral (as defined below) other than (i) real estate and (ii) the equity interests of SigmaTron s foreign subsidiaries (unless such a pledge is requested by Lender). As of October 31, 2024, there was 23,387,327 outstanding and 15,168,702 of unused availability under the revolving loan facility compared to an outstanding balance of 28,598,719 and 13,443,766 of unused availability at April 30, 2024. As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the unamortized deferred financing amount offset against outstanding debt was 529,987 and 592,664, respectively. The Term Loan Agreement provides for a term loan from TCW to the Company in the principal amount of 40,000,000 (the TCW Term Loan ). The TCW Term Loan bears i nterest at a rate per annum based on SOFR, plus the Applicable Margin of 7.50 (each as defined in the Term Loan Agreement). The TCW Term Loan has a SOFR floor of 1.00 . The maturity date of the TCW Term Loan is July 18, 2027. The amount outstanding as of October 31, 2024, was 38,245,241 compared to an outstanding balance of 37,503,301 at April 30, 2024. As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, 

 39 
 SigmaTron International, Inc. October 31, 2024 

the unamortized deferred financing amount offset against outstanding debt was 2,992,817 and 935,492, respectively. The TCW Term Loan is secured by: (a) a first priority security interest in all property of SigmaTron that does not constitute ABL Priority Collateral, which includes: (i) SigmaTron s interest in its Elk Grove Village real estate, (ii) SigmaTron s machinery, equipment and fixtures (but excluding ABL Priority Equipment (as defined in the ICA)) , (iii) the Term Priority Mexican Inventory (as defined in the ICA), (iv) SigmaTron s stock in its direct and indirect subsidiaries, (v) SigmaTron s general intangibles (excluding any that constitute ABL Priority Collateral), goodwill and intellectual property, (vi) the proceeds of business interruption insurance that constitute Term BI Insurance Share (as defined in the ICA) , (vii) tax refunds, and (viii) all proceeds thereof, in each case, now owned or hereafter acquired (collectively, the Term Priority Collateral and (b) a second priority security interest in all collateral that constitutes ABL Priority Collateral. Also, SigmaTron s three Mexican subsidiaries pledged all of their assets as security for the TCW Term Loan. The net proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Elgin, Illinois, property in February, 2024, reduced the TCW Term Loan. Waivers and Amendments No. 1 2 In March 2023, the Company received default notices from JPM and TCW due to non-compliance with certain financial covenants under their respective Credit Agreements, including the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Total Debt to EBITDA Ratio. Additionally, the Company received a delinquency notification from Nasdaq for failing to timely file its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023, which also constituted a default under the Credit Agreements. Consequently, the total debt balances were classified as current liabilities. On April 28, 2023, the Company entered into waivers with JPM and TCW, which waived certain events of default and amended terms of the Credit Agreements. These amendments included requirements to maintain a minimum of 2.5 million in revolver availability, modifications to the definition of EBITDA, and adjustments to the Total Debt to EBITDA Ratios. On June 15, 2023, the Company executed further amendments to extend TCW s ability to trigger a potential corporate restructuring to occur no earlier than August 1, 2023. Waivers and Amendments No. 3 As of August 19, 2024, the Company was not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreements as follows: the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for multiple twelve month periods including those ending on April 30, 2024 and July 31, 2024 was less than 1.10:1.00, the Total Debt to EBITDA Ratio for the twelve month period ending on April 30, 2024 was greater than 4.50:1.00, and the Total Debt to EBITDA Ratio for the twelve month period ending on July 31, 2024 was greater than 4.25:1.00 (collectively, the 2024 Covenant Defaults ). Due to the 2024 Covenant Defaults, the facilities under the Credit Agreements were classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024. In addition, due to the lender demand of a Replacement Transaction by September 2025 and the risk of additional covenant violations based on current revenue levels (see Note B - Basis of Presentation - Going Concern for additional information) the Company continues to classify this debt as current liabilities as of October 31, 2024. In addition, the Company received a delinquency notification letter from Nasdaq, dated August 16, 2024, indicating that the Company was not in compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq for failing to timely file the Company s F o rm 10- K annual report for the fiscal year ended 

 40 
 SigmaTron International, Inc. October 31, 2024 

April 30, 2024. This notification also constituted a default under the Credit Agreements (collectively with the 2024 Covenant Defaults, the 2024 Defaults ). The Company had 60 days from the date of the Nasdaq delinquency notice, or until October 15, 2024, to file a plan with Nasdaq to regain compliance. On September 10, 2024, the Company received a notification letter from Nasdaq indicating that the Company had regained compliance with the applicable continued listing requirements based on the filing of the Company s F o rm 10- K annual report for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024. On August 19, 2024 (the Third Amendment Effective Date ), the Lender Parties waived the 2024 Defaults pursuant to (i) the Waiver and Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement (the JPM Amendment between the Company and JPM, and (ii) the Waiver and Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement (the TCW Amendment and together with the JPM Amendment, the 2024 Amendments by and among the Company, the TCW Lenders, and the Agent. In consideration of the TCW Amendment, the Company and the Agent also entered into the Third Amendment Fee Letter (the Fee Letter dated as of the Third Amendment Effective Date. The 2024 Amendments provided for, among other things, a waiver of the Company s noncompliance with the financial covenants relating to (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreements), and (ii) the Total Debt to EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreements), in each case as of the Third Amendment Effective Date. The 2024 Amendments also amended other provisions of the Credit Agreements, including to: (i) modify the minimum ratios under the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio to range from 0.70:1.0 for the twelve months ending as of July 31, 2024, to 1.00:1.0 for the twelve months ending as of September 30, 2025 and thereafter, measured monthly; (ii) adjust the maximum ratios under the Total Debt to EBITDA Ratio to range from 6.50:1.0 for the twelve months ending as of July 31, 2024, to 3.50:1.0 for the twelve months ending as of April 30, 2027, measured quarterly; (iii) modify the definition of EBITDA to allow for additional adjustments for certain transactions and charges; (iv) provide for the reimbursement of certain fees by the Company in connection with the Amendments or the transactions contemplated thereby; (v) increase the minimum required Availability (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement) to 3.5 million starting on the Third Amendment Effective Date; (vi) provide that the Company must pursue and close a Replacement Transaction to pay the Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreements) in full no later than September 30, 2025 unless the Company meets certain debt ratios for the twelve month period ending on August 31, 2025; and (vii) require the Company to engage a financial advisor if requested by the Agent after November 1, 2024. In addition, pursuant to the JPM Amendment, the parties agreed to reduce the Revolving Commitment (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement) from 70 million to 55 million as of the Third Amendment Effective Date and pay to JPM certain amendment fees and certain additional fees if the Company does not meet certain financial milestones by the applicable measurement periods specified in the JPM Amendment. In addition, pursuant to the TCW Amendment the parties agreed to (i) amend the principal payment schedule under the TCW Term Loan to 250,000 per quarter; (ii) extend the PIK Period (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) for three additional quarters beyond October 31, 2024 if the Total Debt to EBITDA Ratio exceeds a certain threshold as of certain dates; (iii) permit the Company to elect to pay on a quarterly basis in-kind a portion of the Baseline Applicable Margin (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) per annum provided no default or event of default under the Term Loan Agreement has occurred; (iv) increase a portion of the Term Loan Borrowing Base (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) based on the value of the Company s real estate; (v) reduce the asset coverage pre-payment ratio under the TCW Term Loan to 90 of the outstanding principal balance; and (vi)

 SigmaTron International, Inc. October 31, 2024 

provide the Agent with the right to appoint a non-voting observer to attend regular meetings of the Company s Board of Directors and any relevant committees. Also on August 19, 2024, and in connection with the TCW Amendment, the Company entered into the Fee Letter, which provides for a payment to the Agent of 395,000 added to the principal amount owed under the TCW Term Loan and for certain monthly ticking fees equal to a range of percentages of the outstanding principal amount under the TCW Term Loan, provided the Company does meet certain financial milestones by the applicable dates provided therein. In addition, pursuant to the Fee Letter, if the Company does not meet certain financial metrics from December 2024 to September 2025 as defined in the agreement, the Company has agreed to deliver to the Agent warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock (the Warrants in an amount equal to a percentage of the outstanding common stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis ranging from 1.25 (as of December 1, 2024) to 17.5 (as of September 1, 2025). The exercise price for the Warrants will be 0.01 per share and the Warrants would vest immediately upon issuance. The Company evaluated the accounting for the warrants associated with the Fee Letter to determine whether the warrants should be classified as equity or as a derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in the Entity s Own Equity (ASC 815-40), the Company classifies a warrant as equity if it is indexed to the Company s equity and several specific conditions for equity classification are met. A warrant is not considered indexed to the Company s equity in general when it contains certain types of exercise contingencies or adjustments to exercise price. If a warrant is not indexed to the Company s equity or it has net cash settlement that results in the Warrants to be accounted for under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, or ASC 815-40, it is classified as a derivative liability which is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with any changes in its fair value recognized currently in the statement of operations. The Company concluded that the warrants shall be classified as a liability upon entering into the Fee Letter and as a result recorded a liability of 2,263,000. In subsequent periods, these Warrants are subject to remeasurement. As of October 31, 2024, the warrants were valued at 2,889,000. The remeasurement of the warrants is recorded within the change in fair value of warrants within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All other material terms of the Credit Agreements, as amended by the Amendments, remain unchanged. China Construction Bank On March 15, 2019, the Company s wholly-owned foreign enterprise, Wujiang SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., entered into a credit facility with China Construction Bank. On January 26, 2021, the agreement was amended and expired in accordance with its terms on January 6, 2022. On January 17, 2022, the agreement was renewed, and expired in accordance with its terms on December 23, 2022. On February 17, 2023, the agreement was renewed, and expired in accordance with its terms on February 7, 2024. On March 1, 2024, the agreement was renewed, and is scheduled to expire on February 1, 2025. Under the agreement Wujiang SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. can borrow up to 10,000,000 Renminbi, approximately 1,400,000 as of October 31, 2024, and the facility is collateralized by Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd. s manufacturing building. Interest is payable monthly and the facility bears a fixed interest rate of 3.15 per annum. There was no outstanding balance under the facility at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively.

 SigmaTron International, Inc. October 31, 2024 

Notes Payable Buildings The Company entered into a mortgage agreement on March 3, 2020, in the amount of 556,000, with The Bank and Trust SSB to finance the purchase of the property that serves as the Company s warehousing and distribution center in Del Rio, Texas. The note requires the Company to pay monthly installment payments in the amount of 6,103.

The fluctuation of currencies from time to time, without an equal or greater increase in inflation, could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company. The impact of currency fluctuations for the six month period ended October 31, 2024, resulted in net foreign currency transaction losses of 767,167 compared to net foreign currency losses of 461,859 for the same period in the prior year.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks . As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this item pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. In connection with this review and the audit of the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2024, it identified a material weakness as reported previously, which continues to exist as of October 31, 2024. The Company did not properly design or maintain effective controls related to the application of appropriate accounting principles over non-standard revenue transactions. Specifically, controls to ensure that revenue recognition criteria were met prior to recognizing sales transactions were not operating effectively. Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that as a result of the material weakness and control deficiencies as reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024, its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of October 31, 2024. Notwithstanding the weakness, the Company s management has concluded that the financial statements included elsewhere in this report present fairly, and in all material respects, its financial position, results of operation and cash flow in conformity with GAAP. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 44 
 SigmaTron International, Inc. October 31, 2024 

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting and Disclosure Controls Management remains committed to ongoing efforts to address the material weakness. Although the Company will continue to implement measures to remedy its internal control deficiencies, there can be no assurance that its efforts will be successful or avoid potential future material weaknesses. In addition, until remediation steps have been completed and operated for a sufficient period of time, and subsequent evaluation of their effectiveness is completed, the material weakness previously identified will continue to exist. Other than the remediation efforts previously disclosed, there have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting for the quarter ended October 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time the Company is involved in legal proceedings, claims, or investigations that are incidental to the Company s business. In future periods, the Company could be subjected to cash cost or non-cash charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved on unfavorable terms. However, although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based on present information the Company does not expect these legal proceedings or claims will have any material adverse impact on its future consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Other than the risk factor disclosed in this Item 1A. below, there have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors since the filing of the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of the material weaknesses is not effective, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations. In connection with the Company s management evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, the Company's management has identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. As a result of the material weakness, the Company's management has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of October 31, 2024, as further described in Item 4, Controls and Procedures. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company's material weakness in internal controls was related to the application of appropriate accounting principles over non-standard revenue transactions. Specifically, controls to ensure that revenue recognition criteria were met prior to recognizing sales transactions were not operating effectively. 

 45 
 SigmaTron International, Inc. October 31, 2024 

The Company is taking steps to remediate the material weakness by, among other things, implementing measures to improve its internal control structure, specifically, strengthening the Company's review process related to revenue contracts, such as multiple levels of review and supporting evidence of such transactions. However, no assurance can be given that these measures will remediate the material weakness or prevent additional material weaknesses in the future. The Company may discover additional material weaknesses in its system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in misstatements of its financial statements. The Company's internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. If the Company is unable to remediate the material weakness in a timely manner or if it identifies additional material weaknesses in the future, the Company may be unable to provide required financial information in a timely and reliable manner and the Company may incorrectly report financial information. Likewise, if the Company's financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, the Company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Further, the existence of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect the Company's reputation or investor perceptions of the Company, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of the Company's common stock. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None beyond what was previously disclosed. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. Item 5 . Other Information. None.
