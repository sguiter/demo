The fair values were determined using a model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived or corroborated by observable data. SLB is exposed to risks on future cash flows to the extent that the local currency is not the functional currency and expenses denominated in local currency are not equal to revenues denominated in local currency. SLB uses foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against a portion of these cash flow risks. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. SLB is also exposed to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. While SLB uses foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge this exposure as it relates to certain currencies, these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Instead, the fair value of the derivative is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, as are changes in the fair value of the hedged item.

SLB delivered strong third-quarter 2024 results, achieving earnings growth and margin expansion due to its ongoing focus on cost optimization, greater adoption of SLB s digital products and solutions, and the contribution of long-cycle projects in deepwater and gas. 
 
 This performance was achieved despite an environment where short-cycle activity growth softened, and some international producers exercised cautious spending triggered by lower oil prices and ample global supply, while land activity in the US remained subdued. Third-quarter 2024 global revenue of 9.2 billion was essentially flat with the second quarter of 2024. Revenue grew sequentially in the Middle East Asia and offshore North America but was offset by a decline in Latin America, while Europe Africa revenue was flat sequentially. 
 
 Although some customers have adopted a more cautious approach to their near-term capital expenditures and discretionary spending amid lower commodity prices, most projects are progressing as planned. Recent geopolitical events have further highlighted the importance of long-term energy security and reducing potential supply disruptions. SLB is well-positioned to navigate the evolving market conditions by leveraging its unique exposure to long-cycle projects in international, deepwater, and gas markets. 
 Digital Integration 
 Digital Integration revenue of 1.1 billion increased 4 sequentially due to higher digital revenue while Asset Performance Solutions APS revenue was flat. Digital revenue grew 7 sequentially driven by the increased adoption internationally of our cloud, AI, and edge technology platforms. 
 
 Digital Integration pretax operating margin of 36 expanded 456 basis points bps sequentially, mostly due to improved profitability in digital, following higher uptake of digital products and solutions and cost efficiencies. 
 Reservoir Performance 
 Reservoir Performance revenue of 1.8 billion was flat sequentially as revenue grew in offshore North America and Latin America, offset by declines in Europe Africa and Middle East Asia. 
 
 Reservoir Performance pretax operating margin of 20 contracted 53 bps sequentially largely due to lower profitability in evaluation. 
 Well Construction 
 Well Construction revenue of 3.3 billion declined 3 sequentially on lower revenue in measurements and fluids driven by lower drilling activity in Latin America, US land, and Saudi Arabia. 
 
 16 

Well Construction pretax operating margin of 22 declined 19 bps sequentially due to reduced activity both in North America and internationally. 
 Production Systems 
 Production Systems revenue of 3.1 billion increased 3 sequentially with growth primarily driven by higher sales of surface production systems and completions. 
 
 Production Systems pretax operating margin of 17 expanded 110 bps sequentially with improved profitability in surface production systems, completions, and artificial lift.

(1) Net debt represents gross debt less cash and short-term investments. Management believes that Net debt provides useful information to investors and management regarding the level of SLB s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt. Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, total debt. 

(2) Includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, exploration data costs, and APS investments. 

(3) Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, APS investments and exploration data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of our ability to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, cash flow from operations. 

Key liquidity events during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 included: 
 Capital investments (consisting of capital expenditures, APS investments and exploration data capitalized) were 1.9 billion during both the first nine months of 2024 and the first nine months of 2023. Capital investments for the full year 2024 are expected to be approximately 2.6 billion, which is the same level as the full year 2023. 

In January 2024, SLB announced a 10 increase to its quarterly cash dividend from 0.25 per share of outstanding common stock to 0.275 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in April 2024. Dividends paid during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 1.1 billion and 961 million, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2024, SLB had cumulatively repurchased approximately 3.0 billion of SLB common stock under its 10 billion share repurchase program.

During the second quarter of 2024, SLB and Aker Carbon Capture ASA ACC announced the closing of their previously announced joint venture. The new company, SLB Capturi , combines technology portfolios, expertise, and operation platforms to support accelerated carbon capture adoption for industrial decarbonization at scale. At closing, SLB paid NOK 4.1 billion 0.4 billion) in cash to ACC for the purchase of 80 of the shares in Aker Carbon Capture Holdings AS ACCH ), which held the business of ACC. ACC is also entitled to performance-based payments of up to NOK 1.4 billion if certain targets are met over the period from 2025 to 2027. 

After a lock-up period of three years, ACC is entitled to sell its 20 interest in ACCH to SLB during a period of six months for a price based on the fair market value of the combined business subject to a floor of NOK 1.0 billion and a ceiling of NOK 2.1 billion (the put option ). Additionally, after the expiration of the put option, SLB has the right to purchase ACC s 20 interest in the combined business during the following six months for a price based on the fair market value of the combined business subject to a floor of NOK 1.5 billion and a ceiling of NOK 2.6 billion. 
 During the first quarter of 2023, SLB sold all of its remaining approximately 9 million shares in Liberty and received proceeds of 137 million. 

As of September 30, 2024, SLB had 4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand and committed debt facility agreements with commercial banks aggregating 5.0 billion, all of which was available. SLB believes these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months and beyond. 
 SLB has a global footprint in more than 100 countries. As of September 30, 2024, only three of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5 of SLB s net receivable balance. Only one of these countries, the United States, represented greater than 10 of such receivables. As of September 30, 2024, Mexico represented 9 of SLB's net accounts receivable balance. (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). SLB s receivables from its primary customer in Mexico are not in dispute and SLB has not historically had any material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable relating to this customer. 
 
 On October 17, 2024, SLB entered into a definitive agreement to sell its interest in the Palliser APS project in Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, SLB will receive cash proceeds of approximately 430 million, subject to closing adjustments that are typical for such a transaction. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close late in the fourth quarter of 2024. SLB recorded revenue of approximately 0.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relating to this project.
