 Our Business We develop, manufacture, market and distribute MRI compatible medical devices and accessories, disposables and services relating to them. We are a leader in the development of innovative MRI compatible medical devices. We are the only known provider of a non-magnetic IV infusion pump system that is specifically designed to be safe for use during MRI procedures. We were the first to develop an infusion delivery system that largely eliminates many of the dangers and problems present during MRI procedures. Standard infusion pumps contain magnetic and electronic components, which can create radio frequency interference and are dangerous to operate in the presence of the powerful magnet that drives an MRI system. Our patented MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pump system has been designed with a non-magnetic ultrasonic motor, uniquely designed non-ferrous parts and other special features to safely and predictably deliver anesthesia and other IV fluids during various MRI procedures. Our pump solution provides a seamless approach that enables accurate, safe and dependable fluid delivery before, during and after an MRI scan, which is important to critically ill patients who cannot be removed from their vital medications, and children and infants who must generally be sedated to remain immobile during an MRI scan. Each IV infusion pump system consists of an MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pump, non-magnetic mobile stand, proprietary disposable IV tubing sets and many of these systems contain additional optional upgrade accessories. Our 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system has been designed with non-magnetic components and other special features to safely and accurately monitor a patient s vital signs during various MRI procedures. The IRADIMED 3880 system operates dependably in magnetic fields up to 30,000 gauss, which means it can operate virtually anywhere in the MRI scanner room. The IRADIMED 3880 has a compact, lightweight design allowing it to travel with the patient from their critical care unit to the MRI and back, resulting in increased patient safety through uninterrupted vital signs monitoring and decreasing the amount of time critically ill patients are away from critical care units. The features of the IRADIMED 3880 include: wireless Electrocardiogram (ECG) with dynamic gradient filtering; wireless blood oxygen saturation monitoring (SpO2) using Masimo algorithms; non-magnetic respiratory carbon dioxide (CO2); invasive and non-invasive blood pressure; patient temperature; and optional advanced multi-gas anesthetic agent unit featuring continuous Minimum Alveolar Concentration measurements. The IRADIMED 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system has an easy-to-use design and allows for the effective communication of patient vital signs information to clinicians. We generate revenue from the sale of MRI compatible medical devices and accessories, extended warranty agreements, services related to maintaining our products and the sale of disposable products used with our devices. The principal customers for our MRI compatible products include hospitals and acute care facilities, both in the United States and internationally. As of September 30, 2024, our direct U.S. sales force consisted of 27 field sales representatives, 4 regional sales directors and supplemented by 8 clinical application specialists. Internationally, we have distribution agreements with independent distributors selling our products. Selling cycles for our devices have varied widely and have historically ranged between three and six months in duration. We also enter into agreements with integrated delivery networks IDNs and healthcare supply contracting companies, which are commonly referred to as group purchasing organizations GPOs in the U.S., which enable us to sell and distribute our products to their member hospitals. GPOs negotiate volume purchase prices for hospitals, group practices, and other clinics that are members of a GPO. Under our GPO agreements, we are required to pay the GPOs a fee of three percent of the sales of our products to members of the GPO. Sales to participating IDNs do not have an associated fee. Financial Highlights For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our revenue increased by 1.8 million, or 11.0 to 18.3 million, compared to 16.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Income before the provision for income taxes was 6.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.4 million for the quarter ended

 September 30, 2023. Net income remained consistent at 5.0 million, or 0.40 per diluted share in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the remainder of 2024, we expect higher revenue when compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher sales of our medical devices, related accessories, disposables, and services. We also expect higher operating expenses compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher sales and marketing, regulatory, and general and administrative expenses. Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Annual Report have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider them to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. As of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the information provided regarding recent accounting pronouncements in Note 1 to the Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit increased by 1.4 million, or 10.5 , to 14.2 million from 12.8 million for the same period in 2023. Gross profit margin was 77.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 77.8 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin is primarily due to a favorable inventory adjustment in prior year and current quarter geographic sales mix. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenue increased by 0.9 million, or 7.9 , to 12.3 million from 11.4 million for the same period in 2023. Gross profit increased by 4.9 million, or 13.2 , to 41.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 36.7 million for the same period in 2023. Gross profit margin was 77.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 76.4 for the same period in 2023. The increase in gross profit margin is primarily due to decreased raw material costs, favorable geographic sales mix, and overhead spent as a percentage of revenue. Operating Expenses

This increase is primarily due to higher legal and professional expenses, software maintenance, and increased payroll and benefit expenses.

Table of Contents 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expense increased by 1.3 million, or 12.0 , to 12.1 million from 10.8 million for the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to higher legal and professional expenses, regulatory consulting, and payroll and benefits expenses. Sales and Marketing For the three months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expense increased by 0.9 million, or 31.0 , to 3.8 million from 2.9 million for the same period in 2023. This increase is primarily due to higher sales commissions, sales activities expenses, and payroll and benefits expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expense increased by 2.3 million, or 26.1 , to 11.1 million from 8.8 million for the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales commissions, sales activities expenses, and payroll and benefits expenses. Research and Development For the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expense increased by 0.1 million, or 20.0 , to 0.6 million from 0.5 million for the same period in 2023. This is primarily due to us no longer allocating recently approved product parts related to the next generation pump to research and development, offset by increased payroll and benefit expenses. These approved parts are now included in raw material inventory. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expense increased by 0.1 million, or 4.5 , to 2.3 million from 2.2 million for the same period last year. This is primarily due to higher payroll and benefits expenses as well as software maintenance, and consulting expenses related to the next generation pump. Other Income, Net Other income, net consists of interest income, foreign currency gains and losses, and other miscellaneous income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income, net increased by 0.1 million, to 0.6 million from 0.5 million for the same period in 2023. This increase is due to higher interest rates earned by money market fund investments that comprise a significant portion of our cash balances. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported other income, net, of 1.8 million and 1.2 million, respectively. The change is primarily due to higher interest rates earned by money market fund investments. Income Taxes For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for income tax expense of 1,368,830 and 3,843,834, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 21.3 and 21.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate primarily due to U.S. state income tax expense, partially offset by research and development tax credits. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for income tax expense of 1,341,352 and 3,403,523, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 20.9 and 21.2 , respectively, and differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate primarily due to U.S. Federal income tax expense partially offset by research and development tax credits. On July 31, 2024, the Company received notice of examination from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the tax year ended December 31, 2021. We are currently complying with the taxing authority and believe our tax position for the year under review was appropriate and have not accounted for any proposed adjustments at this time. The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for our United States Federal and certain U.S. state income taxes for 2019 and subsequent years.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity have historically been our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash flow from operations and access to the financial markets. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and dividend payments, if any. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 51.7 million, stockholders equity of 83.4 million, and working capital of 66.2 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 49.8 million, stockholders equity of 71.4 million, and working capital of 59.7 million . On April 3, 2024, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the 2024 Shelf ), which was declared effective by the SEC on May 8, 2024. The 2024 Shelf covers the offering, issuance and sale by the Company of up to an aggregate of 75.0 million of its common stock. As of September 30, 2024, all 75.0 million remained available under the 2024 Shelf. We believe that our current cash, and any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements for at least the next 12 months and into the foreseeable future. We do not anticipate requiring additional capital; however, if required or desirable, we may seek to obtain a credit facility, raise debt, or issue additional equity in private or public markets. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (unaudited) Net cash provided by operating activities 19,637,394 9,552,532 Net cash used in investing activities (5,760,057) (7,374,351) Net cash used in financing activities (11,918,484) (13,393,921) Cash provided by operating activities increased by 10.0 million, to 19.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.6 million for the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operations was positively impacted by net income, lower inventory purchases, and reduced accounts receivable and negatively impacted by higher cash outflows related to accounts payable. Cash used in investing activities decreased by 1.6 million, to 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.4 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we acquired land for 6.2 million in cash to be used for future office, assembly, warehouse, and shipping space to accommodate our increased operations and anticipated growth. The majority of our 2024 spend in investing activities is attributed to construction costs of our new facility on the aforementioned land. Cash used in financing activities decreased by 1.5 million, to 11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 13.4 million for the same period in 2023. In both periods, the Company paid special dividends to our stockholders; and in the 2024 period, we commenced a regular quarterly dividend policy, subject to the sole discretion of the Company s Board of Directors and applicable law. We market our products to end users in the U.S. and to distributors internationally. Sales to end users in the U.S. are generally made on open credit terms. Management maintains an allowance for potential credit losses. Our current manufacturing and headquarters facility has been leased from Susi, LLC, an entity controlled by our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board, Roger Susi. Pursuant to the terms of the Lease Amendment, the monthly base rent is 34,133, adjusted annually for changes in the consumer price index.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the 2023 Annual Report. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) of the Exchange Act are designed to ensure that: (1) information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (2) such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective.
