 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates were calculated using an Annual Effective Tax Rate approach. The book income related to fair value changes to liabilities was excluded from forecasted earnings as these amounts are based on changes in stock price and are unable to be forecasted. The book loss related to impairments was also treated as a discrete item for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the portion of income allocated to noncontrolling interests, the portion of losses incurred primarily in the United Kingdom for which no tax benefit is recognized, certain gains recognized on contingent liabilities for which no tax liability is recognized, and the impact of state and local and non-U.S. taxes. 
 
 The Company regularly evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax asset and may recognize or adjust any valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets generated by its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and its investment in Umbrella. The Company files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the tax years that remain open under the statute of limitations may be subject to examinations by the appropriate tax authorities.

 As part of the Company s strategic review of its Real Estate Businesses, the Company realigned its operating segments which resulted in a change to our reporting units as of September 30, 2024. We determined that triggering events had occurred due to changes in the composition of the our reporting units in addition to declining revenues and increased expenses associated with the Real Estate Businesses. As such, an interim goodwill impairment test of the reporting units was performed prior to their realignment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized an impairment charge of million related to TIG s Investment management agreements IMA ), which is classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. See Note 10 (Intangible Assets, Net) for further details. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a million and million impairment to goodwill for its Wealth Capital Solutions and International Real Estate segments, respectively. The primary drivers of impairment are the financial projections and discount rate for the IMA and financial projections, discount rate, and market multiples for goodwill. As of September 30, 2024, all goodwill allocated to the International Real Estate segment is written off. See Note 17 (Segment Reporting) for further information about changes to the Company s segments. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company evaluated as of September 30, 2023 whether circumstances existed, indicating that the fair value of its reporting units may have declined to an amount lower than the carrying value of goodwill recorded on its Consolidated Statement of Position as of that date. The Company considered a variety of factors, including the impact of prevailing market conditions, persistently high interest rates and uncertainties caused by inflation and certain world events as well as the recent actions taken by the Company to restructure and reposition certain of the businesses within its reporting units. Based on the evaluation of these factors, the Company concluded that triggering events had occurred during the period that required the Company to assess whether the goodwill allocated to its legacy Strategic Alternatives reporting unit was impaired. Accordingly, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test, which compared the estimated fair value of the legacy Strategic Alternatives reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach and the Guideline Public Company Method GPCM under the market approach, in equal weightings, in determining a fair value for the reporting unit. The results of the impairment test performed at September 30, 2023 indicated that the carrying value of the legacy Strategic Alternatives reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value by million. Consequently, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge for this amount. 
 
 The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses require significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The Company s forecasted cash flows were based on its current assessment of the markets and on assumed growth rates expected as of the measurement date. The key assumptions used in the cash flows were revenue growth rates, operating expenses, gross margins, and discount rates that appropriately reflect the risks inherent in the cash

Any additional Series A Preferred Shares issued to Allianz will abide under the same conditions and terms as under the Investment as described in Note 1 (Description of the Business). The Allianz Tranche Right is classified as a contingently convertible instrument and will be included in our diluted earnings per share if the right has been exercised within the reporting period. As of September 30, 2024, no shares under the Allianz Tranche Right had been issued. 
 (5) As mentioned in footnote 2 above, during the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued Series C Preferred Shares and Warrants for Class A Shares. The Warrants do not participate in dividends declared on common stock and are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share. Since the Warrants are classified as liabilities and remeasured at fair value each period, application of the treasury stock method for calculation of diluted earnings per share includes reversing the income statement effect of the fair value remeasurement for the period.

 million and million, respectively. Payments under the TRA that are on account of liabilities arising in connection with the Business Combination will be revalued at the end of each reporting period with the gain or loss recognized in earnings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company carried million and million, respectively, of its TRA liability at fair value, as it is contingent consideration from the Business Combination. The remaining portion of the TRA liability is carried at a value equal to the expected future payments under the TRA. 
 In connection with the TRA, certain parties to the Business Combination who received Class B Units in Umbrella have the ability to exchange Class B Units in Umbrella (along with their paired Class B shares) for shares of Class A Common Stock in the Company on a :1 exchange basis. These future exchanges are anticipated to be treated as taxable exchanges which may provide an increase in the tax basis of the assets of the Company and therefore provide for additional payments under the TRA. TRA liabilities that are generated on account of future exchanges will be recorded under ASC 450, Contingencies . On August 31, 2023, holders of Class B Units exchanged Class B Paired Interests with the Company, for shares of Class A Common Stock on a :1 basis totaling an amount equal to multiplied by the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock received at the time of the transaction. On March 11, 2024, holders of Class B Units exchanged Class B Paired Interests with the Company, for shares of Class A Common Stock on a :1 basis totaling an amount equal to multiplied by the total number of shares of Class B Paired Interests exchanged at the time of the transaction. On May 14, 2024, holders of Class B Units exchanged Class B Paired Interests with the Company, for shares of Class A Common Stock on a :1 basis totaling an amount equal to multiplied by the total number of shares of Class B Paired Interests exchanged at the time of the transaction. On August 19, 2024, holders of Class B Units exchanged Class B Paired Interests with the Company, for shares of Class A Common Stock on a :1 basis totaling an amount equal to multiplied by the total number of shares of Class B Paired Interests exchanged at the time of the transaction. 
 Payments under the TRA will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless (i) the Company exercises its right to terminate the TRA and pays recipients an amount representing the present value of the remaining payments, (ii) there is a change of control or (iii) the Company breaches any of the material obligations of the TRA, in which case all obligations will generally be accelerated and due as if the Company had exercised its right to terminate the TRA. In each case, if payments are accelerated, such payments will be based on certain assumptions, including that the Company will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, assuming no material changes in the relevant tax laws and that the Company generates sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased amortization resulting from the increase in tax basis of certain of AlTi s assets, we expect to pay approximately million under the TRA. Future changes in the fair value of the TRA liability will be recognized in earnings. Any future cash savings and related payments under the TRA due to subsequent exchanges of Class B Paired Interests for shares of Class A Common Stock would be accounted for separately from the amount related to the Business Combination.

Upon the Company s Class A Share price meeting a volume-weighted average price threshold of for out of trading days within of the Closing, the remaining percent of the Business Combination Earn-out Securities will vest and be issued. If, within of the Closing, a change of control event occurs (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), any Business Combination Earn-out Securities not previously issued will be deemed to have vested and will be issued (or, in the case of the Sponsor, which shares have already been issued, will no longer be subject to forfeiture).

 Litigation 
 From time to time, we may be named as a defendant in legal or regulatory actions. Although there can be no assurance of the outcome of such matters, management s current assessment is that no loss contingency reserve is required to be recorded as of September 30, 2024 for any potential liability related to any current legal or regulatory proceeding or claim that would individually or in the aggregate materially affect our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
 
 Home REIT is a real estate investment trust company listed on the London Stock Exchange. AFM UK was its alternative investment fund manager AIFM until August 21, 2023 and AHRA was its investment adviser until June 30, 2023. Services are no longer provided by any AlTi companies or any legacy Alvarium companies to Home REIT. AFM UK is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. AHRA was owned by ARE (another wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) up until December 30, 2022, when it was sold. AlTi was formed on January 3, 2023, through the Business Combination that included certain legacy Alvarium companies, including AFM UK.

contribution to any losses incurred by Home REIT or its directors if current or former shareholders in Home REIT issue claims against them as outlined in the preceding paragraph; and (ii) on a standalone basis, for losses they assert have been incurred by Home REIT as a result of alleged breaches of contractual, tortious and fiduciary duties, unlawful means conspiracy and deceit by AFM UK and/or AHRA, and, in the case of ARE, they assert that ARE is liable to Home REIT for any acts or omissions of AHRA under the UK s appointed representative regime. It is not possible at this point in time for us to reliably assess what the quantum of such claims might be, or AFM UK s and ARE s potential exposure, though they may potentially be material. Our intent is that any litigation or other action commenced by Home REIT and/or its directors against AFM UK and/or ARE will be defended vigorously. However, if any claims were commenced, we would anticipate that such claims may involve complex questions of law and fact, and significant legal expenses may be incurred in defending such litigation. 
 HLIF is a private fund which pursues a similar investment strategy to Home REIT. In the period from June 30, 2022 to December 31, 2023, the estimated value of its underlying real estate investment portfolio declined by approximately , due to a decrease in the timely collection of rents on the underlying portfolio, but also due to higher interest rates and other macro-economic factors. HLIF is managed by AFM UK as its AIFM and authorized corporate director and is advised by SHIA. Like AHRA, SHIA was permitted to perform certain limited regulated activities as an appointed representative of its regulated principal firm, ARE. 
 
 In February 2024, the UK FCA commenced investigations into the historic performance of certain group entities, in their services to Home REIT and/or HLIF, and whether they breached certain civil or criminal regulatory rules and/or principles. The investigations relate to the historic management of Home REIT and/or HLIF by certain legacy Alvarium companies. The investigations are focused primarily on whether any false or misleading statements were made in relation to Home REIT and/or HLIF and/or whether these group entities breached other FCA rules and/or principles. ARE and AFM have voluntarily requested the imposition of requirements by the UK FCA which primarily involves the companies agreeing to maintain their current assets

 In this section, unless the context otherwise requires, references to AlTi, we, us, and our are intended to mean the business and operations of AlTi and its consolidated subsidiaries. The following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of AlTi and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated unaudited financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report. 
 Amounts and percentages presented throughout our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations may reflect rounded results in thousands (unless otherwise indicated) and consequently, totals may not appear to sum. 
 
 Our Business 
 We are a global wealth management firm, with a diverse array of investment, advisory, and administrative capabilities with which we serve our clients and investors, and provide value to our shareholders. As of the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, management completed a strategic review of certain businesses within the historically defined Strategic Alternatives segment. This review considered, among other things, changes to our legal entity structure as well as changes of the components included within the operating segments outlined below. As part of the changes of our segment composition, our business is currently organized into two business segments - Wealth Capital Solutions and International Real Estate: 
 we manage or advise approximately 77.3 billion in combined assets as of September 30, 2024; 
 in our Wealth Capital Solutions segment, we provide holistic solutions for our wealth management and alternative investments clients through our full spectrum of wealth and asset management services, including discretionary investment management services, non-discretionary investment advisory services, trust services, administration services, and family office services; 
 in our International Real Estate segment, we assist our investors with real estate co-investments by providing access to highly differentiated opportunities in these areas as well as structuring and selecting partners with a proven track record in alternative asset classes, with attractive risk adjusted return characteristics. 
 
 Our business is global, with approximately 440 professionals operating in 21 cities in 9 countries across three continents as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The services that we provide form a complementary ecosystem for our target markets of clients, investors, and businesses, many of whom share common interests and goals that we can connect and serve. The complementary nature of our services and a differentiated suite of capabilities position us well for organic growth across our business lines. Our strategy includes a focus on inorganic growth through acquisitions and investments in talented managers in exchange for a share of future revenues or profits. We also believe we are well positioned to capitalize on global market trends and dynamics that we see facing our world as well as the industry, clients, investors, and businesses we serve. 
 
 Fee Structure 
 
 Consistent with offering a diverse range of services, we generate a diverse range of revenue streams across our business lines. A high-level summary of these revenue streams is set forth below. 
 Broadly, our revenues fall into four categories: (i) recurring management, advisory, or administration fees; (ii) performance or incentive fees; (iii) distribution from investments and (iv) other income or fees: 
 90 

Management, advisory, and administration fees are historically more predictable across market conditions than our other revenue sources. These fees are recurring in nature (usually being annual or quarterly fees) and are earned from both our wealth management division from investment management, investment advisory, trusts and administration, and family office services, and also from our fund management activities associated with our internally managed funds. Added to the recurring nature of these fees, our high client retention rate in our wealth management services, and the long-term nature of our fund management fees, means that these fees are also relatively stable. 
 Incentive or performance fees are comprised of both carried interest payments we earn on co-investments and annual performance or incentive fees earned in some cases from our investment management and advisory or fund management services associated with our internally managed funds. These fees, being performance related, are variable in nature and more susceptible to impact from exogenous factors. As a result, performance and incentive fees provide potential upside to our revenues in the future and, in our view, can be highly accretive to our profitability. 
 Distributions from investments are generated from the equity interests we have in the three external managers pursuant to which we are entitled to distributions based on the terms of the respective arrangements. Distributions from each investment will be recorded upon receipt of the distribution. We receive distributions from our External Strategic Managers through our profit or revenue sharing arrangements that are generated through their management and incentive fees based on the performance of the underlying investments. The management component of the distributions is recurring in nature, while the incentive portion is more susceptible to impact from exogenous factors. 
 Other income or fees included transaction fees from businesses we have exited or are in the process of exiting such as strategic advisory, corporate advisory, brokerage, and placement agency services. Transaction fees are generally non-recurring in nature, are typically commission based, and are payable on the successful completion of a transaction. Transactions are also susceptible to impact from exogenous factors. 
 Wealth Capital Solutions Income 
 Management Fees 
 Investment management or advisory fees are the primary source of revenue in our Wealth Capital Solutions segment. These fees are generally calculated on the basis of a percentage of the value of each client s assets (AUM or AUA) and are charged using either an average daily balance or ending balance, quarterly in arrears. Fees from internal fund management and advisory services related to our alternatives platform are approximately 0.75 to 1.5 of the net asset value of the funds underlying investments. 
 AUM refers to the market value of all assets that we manage, provide discretionary investment advisory services on, and have execution responsibility for. Although we have investment responsibility for AUM, we include both billable (assets charged fees) and non-billable assets (assets exempt of fees) in our AUM calculation (e.g., we have agreements with certain clients under which we do not bill on certain securities or cash and cash equivalents held within their portfolio). AUM includes the value of all assets managed or supervised by operating partner subsidiaries, affiliates, and joint ventures in which the Company holds either a majority or minority stake. Our calculations of AUM and AUA may differ from the calculation methodologies of other wealth managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other wealth managers. 
 AUA consists of all assets we are responsible for overseeing and reporting on, but we do not necessarily charge fees on all such assets. Billable assets represent the portion of our assets on which we charge fees. Non-billable assets are exempt of fees and consist of assets such as cash and cash equivalents in certain agreed upon situations, personally owned real estate, and other designated assets. 
 The fees vary depending upon the level and complexity of client assets and the services being provided. The fee typically covers investment advisory services and basic estate and wealth planning services. The more complex 
 91 

estate and wealth planning services, as well as our Trustee service, and certain extended family office services, are typically billed separately, as a fixed or time-based amount. 
 Incentive Fees 
 
 TIG Arbitrage is entitled to receive incentive fees if certain performance returns have been achieved as stipulated in our governing documents. The incentive fees for TIG Arbitrage are calculated using 15 to 20 of the net profit/income. We recognize our incentive fees when it is no longer probable that a significant reversal of revenue will occur. Our incentive fees are not subject to clawback provisions. 
 
 Distributions from Investments 
 
 Distributions from investments are earned through our profit or revenue sharing arrangements with the External Strategic Managers. Our economic interests in the External Strategic Managers are as follows: 
 Real Estate Bridge Lending Strategy 20.92 profit share; 
 European Equities 25 revenue share; and 
 Asian Credit and Special Situations 12 revenue share 
 Our distributions from investments from European equities and Asian credit and special situations are comprised of a management fee component and, depending on performance, an incentive fee component. Depending on the fund, the incentive fee component can range from 15 to 35 of the net profit/income, in excess of a 10 return hurdle. 
 Some clients in certain jurisdictions may also pay performance fees if their portfolio achieves returns in excess of an agreed benchmark or hurdle rate. Typically, such fees are paid annually upon crystallization and are not accrued prior to being earned. 
 International Real Estate Income 
 Fund Management Fees 
 We earn management fees in our International Real Estate segment through private real estate fund management and private real estate recurring fees. We generate income for managing and advising a private real estate investment fund. Our fees from managing and advising this vehicle are contained in management and advisory contracts relating to the relevant fund and are typically calculated on a sliding scale of percentages of the asset value, market capitalization or the investor capital of the relevant fund as applicable. 
 
 Real Estate Co-investment 
 As sponsors of private market direct and co-investment transactions, we generate income from debt and equity structures relating to specified real estate investments or investments in other alternative asset classes. Private market fees include arrangement, retainer, management, advisory, performance, acquisition, promotion and other associated fees as well as interest arbitrage for debt structures. Arrangement fees are typically 50 to 100 basis points of equity value contributed into a transaction. Acquisition fees are typically payable where there are no agency fees or where there is an off-market transaction sourced by the team. Such acquisition fees are usually in the range of 50 to 100 basis points of the purchase price of the relevant acquisition. The equity structures are typically medium to long-term (three to ten years) closed-ended structures with fees normally ranging between 50 and 175 basis points of the equity value committed or drawn. The debt structure terms are generally between 12 and 36 months. The investment adviser, general partner or other entity entitled to fees in respect of each of our co-investments receives such fees either monthly, quarterly, or annually. 
 We may be entitled to a portion of the performance-related entitlements (such as carried interest or promotion) that may be payable on exit from Co-investment transactions. Such revenues are only received if the investor hurdle (i.e. a minimum return to the investor) is reached and may include a catch-up. Carried interest entitlements are based on a percentage of the investor return above such hurdle and are set on a deal and fund basis. Typically, carried interest entitlements represent 10 to 20 of the investors equity internal rate of 
 92 

return in excess of an 8 to 15 hurdle, with no carried interest entitlement being payable if the hurdle is not met. In relation to our co-investments, a group company will typically have entered into an advisory or management agreement, or other arrangement, that entitles us to receive a share of base management fees (whether directly or through a joint venture entity) from the inception of the relevant investment or joint venture, through to exit and the liquidation of the relevant transaction vehicle, or as otherwise set out in an approved business plan. Where we have established feeder vehicles for clients, there may also be administration and advisory fees associated with those vehicles (these are earned by our trusts and administration business). 
 
 Market Trends and Business Environment 
 
 Our business is directly and indirectly affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions, particularly in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe and Asia. Our business is also sensitive to current and expected interest rates, as well as the currency markets. 
 
 After significant market gains in the first half of 2024, the third quarter continued the pattern of strong equity market performance. Government fixed income markets over the third quarter to the end of September, also rallied strongly as generally yields fell and bond prices rose. It is also noteworthy that credit conditions in the U.S. continued to improve with credit spreads the extra yield over Treasuries that corporate bonds must pay to compensate for extra risk continued to narrow. 
 
 Our fee-based revenue streams are driven by the value of our clients portfolio holdings, in the case of our Wealth Capital Solutions segment or the performance of our varied funds and direct investments in our International Real Estate segment. The overall level of revenues in these businesses, however, does not correlate completely with changes in global equity and fixed income markets. 
 
 In our Wealth Capital Solutions segment, while our client portfolios are well diversified across a range of asset classes and thus are not solely impacted by changes in equities or government bonds, they benefited in the year from the strong performance of these exposures. Client portfolios also include holdings such as gold, credit, infrastructure, and hedge funds that also delivered positive returns for the quarter and year to date. Portfolio performance changes depend on multiple additional factors that include, but are not limited to, the risk profile of each client, the level of alternative and private market holdings and the geographic and industry mix of client s equity and fixed income assets. We also note that our UHNW client base generally does not need to draw down materially from their portfolios to support day-to-day living needs and, accordingly, are able to approach portfolio investing with a long-term time horizon. Hence, in terms of behavior, they are less sensitive to short-term fluctuations and volatility in market conditions. 
 
 In our Wealth Capital Solutions segment, fees are also derived from alternative funds which are structured to have low correlation to equity and fixed income markets and in some cases benefit in times of market stress. Our European long-short equity and Asian Credit manager continue to perform well this year. With respect to incentive fees earned by our event-driven strategy, US GAAP only permits recognition of such fees when it is probable there will be no significant reversal, which typically occurs in the fourth quarter of each year. 
 
 The higher cost of capital environment, ongoing increases in construction costs and generally stagnating real estate prices are negatively impacting some of the real estate segments in which we operate. These declines impact the level of management fees that we earn. On the private real estate side within the International Real Estate segment, the more difficult market and interest rate conditions may reduce the ultimate return expected from some of these investments. It is important to note that these assets are utilized in conjunction with longer-term investment strategies and are not subject to daily market pricing. Given the uncertainty in outlook, and the potential for diminution in value at realization, we modified our billing methodology for certain of our private real estate holdings, which will result in lower fees earned, until monetization. 
 
 We generally do not hedge investment currency risk associated with client portfolios and investor holdings across global markets. Hence, as we report our revenues in U.S. dollars, the translation impact from changes in the value of currencies outside the U.S. dollar can impact our results in any given financial reporting period.

We believe that the combination of our Wealth Capital Solutions and International Real Estate segments differentiates us from pure-play firms in both sectors and provides a growing base of recurring and diversified revenues. Since the Business Combination, total AUM/AUA increased by approximately 19 , and within our Wealth Capital Solutions segment, these have grown 34 since the Business Combination. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of 153.6 million. We believe these results, generated through a combination of strong market performance and organic client wins, are starting to reflect the power of our franchise, which we believe will continue to flow to an improved bottom line as we look forward to the remainder of 2024. Net income was (98.6) million and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization Adjusted EBITDA was approximately 21.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 We have continued to right-size the organization, simplify our business lines, and initiate processes to reduce the number of our regulated entities, while securing important client wins and adding key revenue-generating talent. Since the beginning of the year, we have reported AUM/AUA growth amidst a volatile market environment. 
 
 Our core businesses continue to perform well, as reflected in the results of our Wealth Capital Solutions segment, which for the current quarter reported 17 higher revenues 62 higher Adjusted EBITDA compared to the prior year period Further, we continue to focus on efforts to reduce recurring spend on operating costs, while maintaining diligent control on investments in people and infrastructure to facilitate additional scalability and growth. In addition, we believe that we will be able to continue to deploy the capital raised from the investments from Allianz and Constellation to make accretive investments that will benefit our GAAP results and Adjusted EBITDA in future periods. 
 
 Managing Business Performance and Key Financial Measures 
 Non-US GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA as non-US GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable US GAAP measure of net income (loss). Adjusted Net Income represents net income (loss) before taxes plus (a) equity-settled share-based payments, (b) transaction-related costs, including professional fees, (c) impairment of equity method investments, (d) change in fair value of investment or other financial instruments, (e) onetime bonuses recorded in the statement of operations, (f) compensation expense related to the earn-in of certain variable interest entities, and (g) adjusted income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA represents adjusted net income plus (a) interest expense, net, (b) income tax expense, (c) adjusted income tax expense less income tax expense, and (d) depreciation and amortization expense. 
 We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA as non-US GAAP measures to track our performance and assess our ability to service our borrowings. These non-US GAAP financial measures supplement and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of, the results of operations, which are discussed further under Components of Consolidated Results of Income and are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. For the specific components and calculations of these non-US GAAP measures, as well as a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure in accordance with US GAAP, see Reconciliation of Consolidated US GAAP Financial Measures to Certain Non-US GAAP Measures.

Operating Metrics 
 We monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the wealth and asset management industry, which are discussed below. 
 AlTi Global, Inc. 
 AUM: 47.1 billion 
 AUA: 77.3 billion 
 Wealth Capital Solutions 
 AUM: 46.7 billion 
 AUA: 68.3 billion 
 International Real Estate 
 AUM: 0.4 billion 
 AUA: 9.0 billion 

Wealth Capital Solutions - AUM 
 
 AUM refers to the market value of all assets that we manage, provide discretionary investment advisory services on, and have execution responsibility for. Although we have investment responsibility for AUM, we include both billable (assets charged fees) and non-billable assets (assets exempt of fees) in our AUM calculation (e.g., we have agreements with certain clients under which we do not bill on certain securities or cash and cash equivalents held within their portfolio). AUM includes the value of all assets managed or supervised by operating partner subsidiaries, affiliates, and joint ventures in which the Company holds either a majority or minority stake. Our calculations of AUM and AUA may differ from the calculation methodologies of other wealth managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other wealth managers. 
 
 The table below presents the change in our total AUM for the wealth management businesses within the Wealth Capital Solutions segment for the periods indicated:

 Wealth Capital Solutions - AUA 
 
 AUA includes all assets we manage as defined above, oversee, and report on. We view AUA as a core metric to measure our investment and fundraising performance as it includes non-financial assets (e.g., real estate) that 
 99 

are not included in AUM, investment consulting assets (not included in AUM but revenue generating) and other assets that we do not charge fees upon and do not have responsibility for investment execution responsibility, but the reporting of which is valued by our clients. AUA includes the value of all assets managed or supervised by operating partner subsidiaries, affiliates, and joint ventures in which the Company holds either a majority or minority stake. Our calculations of AUA and AUM may differ from the calculation methodologies of other wealth managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other wealth managers.

 Components of Consolidated Results of Income 
 Revenues 
 Management/Advisory Fees 
 For services provided to each client account, the Company charges investment management, custody, and/or trustee fees based on the fair value of the assets of such account Management/advisory fees ). The Company invoices clients based on the terms outlined in the signed customer contract (e.g., quarterly in arrears or in advance) based on the fair market value or net asset value. For those assets for which valuations are not available on a daily basis, the most recent valuation provided to the Company is used as the fair value for the purpose of calculating the quarterly fee. 
 The customer exchanges consideration to obtain services that are the output of the Company s ordinary activities, which are investment management services provided to each client account. Further, none of the scope exceptions under ASC 606-10-15-2 apply to the Management/advisory fees; therefore, they are in the scope of ASC 606. 
 Incentive Fees 
 The Company is entitled to receive incentive fees if certain targeted returns have been achieved as stipulated in its customer contracts. The incentive fees are generally calculated using 15 to 20 of the net profit its customers earn. Incentive fees are generally calculated and recognized when it is probable that there will be no significant reversal. 
 Distributions from Investments 
 
 The Company has equity interests in three entities pursuant to which it is entitled to distributions based on the terms of the respective arrangements. Distributions from each investment will be recorded upon receipt of the distribution. The Company receives distributions from External Strategic Managers through profit or revenue sharing arrangements that are generated through management and incentive fees based on performance of the underlying investments. 
 Other Fees 
 
 The Company generates arrangement fees in its co-investment division by arranging private debt or equity financing, generally in connection with an acquisition. Arrangement fees range from 0.5 to 1.75 of the equity value contributed into a transaction and are payable upon close of the deal. The Company also generates brokerage fees which are similar to arrangement fees except that they are generally paid for assisting public companies in raising capital. 
 Expenses 
 Compensation and Employee Benefits: Compensation generally includes salaries, bonuses, other performance-based compensation such as commissions, long-term deferral programs, benefits, and payroll taxes. 
 102 

Compensation is accrued over the related service period and long-term deferral program awards are paid out based on the various vesting dates. 
 General, Administrative and Other Expenses: General, administrative and other expenses include costs primarily related to professional services, occupancy, travel, communication and information services, distribution costs, and other general operating items. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses: Fixed assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis, with the corresponding depreciation and amortization expense included within depreciation and amortization in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The estimated useful life for leasehold improvements is the lesser of the remaining lease term or the life of the asset, while other fixed assets are generally depreciated over a period of three to fifteen years. 
 Interest Expense: I nterest expense consists of the interest expense on our outstanding debt, amortization of deferred financing costs, and amortization of original issue discount. 
 Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense consists of taxes paid or payable by our consolidated operating subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries are treated as flow-through entities for federal income tax purposes and, accordingly, are not subject to federal and state income taxes, as such taxes are the responsibility of certain direct and indirect owners of the flow-through entities. However, the flow-through entities are subjected to UBT and certain other state taxes. A portion of our operations is conducted through domestic and foreign corporations that are subject to corporate level taxes and for which we record current and deferred income taxes at the prevailing rates in the various jurisdictions in which these entities operate.

 Consolidated Condensed Results of Operations For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 For the Three Months Ended Favorable (Unfavorable) (Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Revenues Management/advisory fees 49,633 44,004 5,629 Incentive fees 88 885 (797) Distributions from investments 3,562 2,596 966 Other income/fees 60 701 (641) Total Revenues 53,343 48,186 5,157 Expenses Compensation and employee benefits 40,470 40,009 461 Non-compensation expenses 28,886 33,246 (4,360) Total Operating Expenses 69,356 73,255 (3,899) Other income (expenses) (104,875) (149,481) 44,606 Net loss before taxes (120,888) (174,550) 53,662 Income tax (expense)/benefit

103 

Revenue 
 
 Management / advisory fees. Management and advisory fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 5.6 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher management fees in Wealth Capital Solutions, principally due to the acquisition of Envoi at the beginning of the quarter, as well as organic growth over the past year, which led to higher AUM. These gains were partially offset by lower management fees from the Arbitrage strategy. 
 
 Incentive fees. Incentive fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 0.8 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to higher investor redemptions in the Arbitrage strategy within our Wealth Capital Solutions segment in the prior period, which had resulted in greater crystallized incentive fees. 
 
 Distributions from investments. Distributions from investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 1.0 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by higher distributions related to incentive fees in the European Equities strategy. These increases were largely offset by lower distributions related to management fees in the Real Estate Bridging strategy and lower incentive fees in the Asian Credit strategy. 
 
 Other fees / income. Other fees and income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.6 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower transactional income in International Real Estate. This segment generated 0.7 million in fees for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Expenses 
 
 Compensation expense. Compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 0.5 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by higher accruals for incentive compensation in the current year period, partially offset by lower salary and other net benefits costs. 
 
 Non-compensation expense. Non-compensation expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 4.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The prior year period included approximately 4.3 million in foreign currency losses on certain intra-group funding arrangements, which were restructured during that period to reduce currency exposures. Professional fees also declined 2.3 million compared to the prior year period, as we continue efforts to rationalize spending on consultants and outside advisors. These decreases were partially offset by higher expenses for technology, marketing and distribution, and occupancy. 
 
 Other income (expenses) 
 
 Other income (expenses) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 44.6 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The prior year period included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling 153.9 million, resulting from the exit and restructuring of certain businesses within the former Strategic Alternatives segment. In the current year period, goodwill and intangible impairment charges totaled 116.1 million. 
 
 The charges in the current year period were due to a strategic review of the Company s Real Estate Businesses and the decision to change the composition of its operating segments. This led to a goodwill impairment charge of 69.7 million and an intangible asset impairment charges totaling 46.6 million. The goodwill impairment charge was mainly due to declines in forecasted net cash flows from the real estate co-investment and fund management businesses compared to the prior year s assessment. As a result, all goodwill previously attributed to these business was fully written off as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 104 

Additionally, a non-cash impairment charge of 44.9 million was recorded to write down the intangible asset representing the value of the investment management contract for the internally managed Event Driven strategy. This charge was due to a decline in forecasted net cash flows for this contract, primarily driven by a reduction in AUM over the past 12-18 months. In the current quarter, we also recorded higher net unrealized gains of 4.7 million on certain items accounted for at fair value, primarily related to investments in external managers. 
 
 Taxes 
 
 The Company s effective tax rate was 7.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the 3-month period ended September 30, 2023, differed from the statutory U.S. corporate tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of mark-to-market losses associated with contingent liabilities and equity consideration in the Business Combination, and goodwill impairment. The effective tax rate for the 3-month period ended September 30, 2024, differs from the statutory U.S. corporate tax rate, generally due to the impact of a forecasted valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets generated in the Company s subsidiaries in the U.K., the portion of income allocated to noncontrolling interests, and the impact of a deferred tax asset relating to the Company s US asset management business. 
 
 Consolidated Condensed Results of Operations For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 For the Nine Months Ended Favorable (Unfavorable) (Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Revenues Management/advisory fees 142,886 137,318 5,568 Incentive fees 304 1,931 (1,627) Distributions from investments 9,972 14,829 (4,857) Other income/fees 446 3,440 (2,994) Total Revenues 153,608 157,518 (3,910) Expenses Compensation and employee benefits 118,920 137,133 (18,213) Non-compensation expenses 80,324 101,953 (21,629) Total Operating Expenses 199,244 239,086 (39,842) Other income (expenses) (62,859) (165,938) 103,079 Net loss before taxes (108,495) (247,506) 139,011 Income tax (expense)/benefit 
 9,876 12,578 (2,702) Net (loss) income (98,619) (234,928) 136,309 
 Revenue 
 
 Management / advisory fees. Management and advisory fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 5.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by higher fees in Wealth Capital Solutions, primarily due to the inclusion of EEA and Envoi in our results, strong market performance, and other organic growth over the past year. These gains were partially offset by lower management fees in the Arbitrage strategy and in International Real Estate,due to the disposition of LRA on March 6, 2024, the deconsolidation of AHRA as of the end of the prior year period, and the repositioning of that segment over the past year. 
 
 105 

Incentive fees. Incentive fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 1.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to higher investor redemptions in the prior year period in the Arbitrage strategy within Wealth Capital Solutions, resulting in higher crystallized incentive fees in the prior period compared to the current year period. 
 
 Distributions from investments. Distributions from investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 4.9 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.This decrease was primarily due to lower distributions related to incentive fees in the European Equities strategy within Wealth Capital Solutions in the current period. The prior year saw particularly strong performance in this strategy, leading to significant distributions related to incentive fees. 
 
 Other fees / income. Other fees and income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 3.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by lower transactional income in International Real Estate, which generated 239.0 thousand in fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Expenses 
 
 Compensation expense. Compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 18.2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower non-cash stock based compensation costs. The prior year period included 24.7 million of expense related to both legacy TWMH and Alvarium incentive plans, as well as the issuance of AlTi equity following the Business Combination. These savings were partially offset by higher net benefits costs in the current period. 
 
 Non-compensation expense. Non-compensation expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 21.6 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a 21.1 million decline in professional fees. The prior year period included significant advisor costs in connection with the Business Combination and other transactions completed during that time. 
 
 Other income (expenses) 
 
 Other income (expenses) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 103.1 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower goodwill and impairment charges and higher net unrealized gains on items accounted for at fair value. The prior year period included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling 153.9 million from the exit and restructuring of certain business within the former Strategic Alternatives segment, as well as a 29.4 million impairment of intangibles related to the deconsolidation of AHRA. 
 
 In the current year period, we recorded goodwill and intangible impairment charges totaling 116.1 million in the third quarter and an additional 0.7 million related to impairment of customer intangibles in the second quarter. Additionally, in the current quarter, net unrealized gains increased by 36.1 million. Certain items accounted for at fair value. such as investments in external managers, warrants issued in connection with financing transactions, and the Tax Receivable Agreement had higher net unrealized gains in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, than in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These gains were partially offset by lower net unrealized gains on earn-out obligations for the same comparable periods. 
 
 These year over year increases in Other income were partially offset by higher interest expense, totaling 4.6 million in the current year period. 
 
 Taxes 
 
 The Company s effective tax rate was 9.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 13.3 for nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2023 differs from the statutory U.S. corporate tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of mark-to-market losses 
 106 

associated with contingent liabilities and equity consideration in the Business Combination, and goodwill impairment. The effective tax rate for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2024 differs from the statutory U.S. corporate tax rate generally due to the impact of a forecasted valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets generated in the Company s subsidiaries in the U.K., and the portion of income allocated to noncontrolling interests, and the impact of a deferred tax asset relating to the Company s US asset management business . 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing, and financing activities. Management takes a prudent approach to ensure the Company's liquidity will continue to be sufficient for its foreseeable working capital needs, contractual obligations, distribution payments and strategic initiatives. 
 
 On January 3, 2023, concurrent with the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company entered into a 250.0 million credit facility with a syndicate led by BMO Capital Markets Corp. The facility, which has a term of five years and is comprised of a 150.0 million revolving credit facility and a 100.0 million term loan facility, was to be used to pay down subsidiary debt and fund growth initiatives. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 40.2 million outstanding on the term loan facility and 91.0 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. See Note 14 (Debt, net of unamortized deferred financing costs) in our accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Allianz and Constellation Investment

Cash Flows 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The following tables and discussion summarize our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows by activity attributable to AlTi. Negative amounts represent an outflow or use of cash. 
 For the Nine Months Ended Favorable (unfavorable) (Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Net cash used in operating activities (50,596) (81,001) 30,405 Net cash used in investing activities 
 (53,467) (132,383) 78,916 Net cash provided by financing activities 
 306,711 30,879 275,832 Effect of exchange rate on cash balances 
 1,244 2,782 (1,538) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 
 203,892 (179,723) 383,615 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased 383.6 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023, primarily due to the Company s net financing activities during the period, which included raising 400.0 million of common and preferred equity before transaction costs. This capital raising activity was partially offset by net reduction in debt outstanding of approximately 57.9 million. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Our cash inflows from operating activities are comprised of cash collected through management and advisory fees, incentive fees, distributions from investments, and other income/fees. Cash outflows primarily include operating expenses, with the most significant components being compensation and benefits, professional fees, and interest on our debt obligations. Our net operating cash outflow of (50.6) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflects the Company s net operating loss for the period, as operating expenses exceeded revenues. Compared to the prior year period, net operating cash outflows declined by 30.4 million, mainly due to lower professional fees, which were higher in the prior year due to extensive use of professional services for capital raising, other financing activities, and supporting the Company s evolving financial reporting infrastructure. Management believes that continued efforts to implement cost rationalization initiatives and to deploy recently raised capital in accretive businesses will further reduce operating cash outflows as the Company scales and matures. 
 
 Our net operating cash outflow of 81.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflects the Company s net operating loss for the period, as operating expenses exceeded revenues. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 53.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven primarily by the deployment of approximately 95.9 million of capital related to the acquisition of EEA, Pointwise, and Envoi, partially offset by approximately 48.9 million of proceeds from the sales of FOS and LRA. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 132.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by transactions with legacy TWMH and TIG shareholders in connection with the Business Combination, as well as the acquisitions of ALWP and AWMS and additional investments in certain external managers. 
 108 

Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 306.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily resulted from the issuance of common and preferred equity, net of transaction costs paid, partially offset by the net pay down of our credit facility, member distributions, and tax payments associated with settlements of equity compensation awards. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 30.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflects the net proceeds from debt issuance and retirement, partially offset by member distributions. 
 Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 In the normal course of business, we may engage in off-balance sheet arrangements, including transactions in derivatives, guarantees, commitments, indemnifications, and potential contingent repayment obligations. We do not have any off-financial position arrangements that would require us to fund losses or guarantee target returns to clients. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 
 As discussed in Note 19 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report, we may in the future be required to make payments under the TRA. 
 Pursuant to the TRA, the Company will pay certain parties to the Business Combination 85 of certain tax benefits, if any, that it realizes (or in certain cases is deemed to realize) as a result of any increase in tax basis of the assets of Umbrella related to the Business Combination. 
 
 Amounts payable under the TRA are contingent upon (i) the generation of taxable income over the life of the TRA, (ii) the tax rates in effect as of time periods in which tax benefits are used, and (iii) certain terms governing the rate of interest to be applied to payments under the TRA. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the liability associated with the TRA was approximately 29.7 million and 17.6 million, respectively. Payments under the TRA that are on account of liabilities arising in connection with the Business Combination will be revalued at the end of each reporting period with the gain or loss recognized in earnings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company carried 9.4 million and 13.2 million, respectively, of its TRA liability at fair value, as it is contingent consideration from the Business Combination. The remaining portion of the TRA liability is carried at a value equal to the expected future payments under the TRA. 
 In connection with the TRA, certain parties to the Business Combination who received Class B Units in Umbrella have the ability to exchange Class B Units in Umbrella (along with their paired Class B shares) for shares of Class A Common Stock in the Company on a 1:1 exchange basis. These future exchanges are anticipated to be treated as taxable exchanges which may provide an increase in the tax basis of the assets of the Company and therefore provide for additional payments under the TRA. TRA liabilities that are generated on account of future exchanges will be recorded under ASC 450, Contingencies . On August 31, 2023, holders of Class B Units exchanged 1,813,248 Class B Paired Interests with the Company, for shares of Class A Common Stock on a 1:1 basis totaling an amount equal to 7.31 multiplied by the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock received at the time of the transaction. On March 11, 2024, holders of Class B Units exchanged 4,954,518 Class B Paired Interests with the Company, for shares of Class A Common Stock on a 1:1 basis totaling an amount equal to 6.61 multiplied by the total number of shares of Class B Paired Interests exchanged at the time of the transaction. On May 14, 2024, holders of Class B Units exchanged 286,242 Class B Paired Interests with the Company, for shares of Class A Common Stock on a 1:1 basis totaling an amount equal to 4.69 multiplied by the total number of shares of Class B Paired Interests exchanged at the time of the transaction. On August 19, 2024, holders of Class B Units exchanged 1,840,077 Class B Paired Interests with 
 109 

the Company, for shares of Class A Common Stock on a 1:1 basis totaling an amount equal to 4.02 multiplied by the total number of shares of Class B Paired Interests exchanged at the time of the transaction. 
 Payments under the TRA will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless (i) the Company exercises its right to terminate the TRA and pays recipients an amount representing the present value of the remaining payments, (ii) there is a change of control or (iii) the Company breaches any of the material obligations of the TRA, in which case all obligations will generally be accelerated and due as if the Company had exercised its right to terminate the TRA. In each case, if payments are accelerated, such payments will be based on certain assumptions, including that the Company will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, assuming no material changes in the relevant tax laws and that the Company generates sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased amortization resulting from the increase in tax basis of certain of AlTi s assets, we expect to pay approximately 29.7 million under the TRA. Future changes in the fair value of the TRA liability will be recognized in earnings. Any future cash savings and related payments under the TRA due to subsequent exchanges of Class B Paired Interests for shares of Class A Common Stock would be accounted for separately from the amount related to the Business Combination. 
 Warrants 
 Prior to the Business Combination, the Company issued Warrants to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock at a price of 11.50 per share. Throughout the period from January 1, 2023 to March 31, 2023, 428,626 Warrants were exercised. On April 3, 2023, 78,864 Warrants were exercised. On June 7, 2023, the Company closed an offer and consent solicitation and entered into a warrant amendment, pursuant to which the remaining 19,892,387 Warrants were exchanged for 4,962,147 shares of Class A Common Stock. The exercises and exchanges throughout the period from January 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023 resulted in an increase in Additional paid-in-capital amount of 29.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, none of such Warrants are outstanding. 
 
 On March 27, 2024, the Company completed the initial issuance of Constellation Warrants to purchase 1,533,333 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of 7.40 per share. On May 15, 2024, the Company completed the issuance of an additional tranche of Constellation Warrants to purchase 466,667 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock. As of September 30, 2024, none of the Constellation Warrants have been exercised. 
 
 On July 31, 2024, the Company issued the Allianz Warrants to purchase 5,000,000 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of 7.40 per share. As of September 30, 2024, none of the Allianz Warrants have been exercised. 
 Business Combination Earn-out 
 Under the terms of the Business Combination, upon Closing, the Sponsor and the selling shareholders of TWMH, TIG, and Alvarium became entitled to receive earn-out shares contingent on various share price milestones. Additionally, upon a change of control of the Company, the share price milestones will be deemed to have been met and all the Business Combination Earn-out Securities will be payable to the earn-out holders. The earn-out shares are precluded from being considered indexed to the Company s own stock and are recognized as a liability at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the earn-out share liability was 14.3 million and 62.4 million, respectively. See Note 2 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) for additional detail. 
 AWMS Earn-out Liability 
 On August 2, 2023, the Company acquired the remaining 70 of the issued and outstanding ownership and membership interests of AWMS, increasing its interest from 30 to 100 . The AWMS Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and the fair value of the total purchase consideration transferred was 16.8 million. The total purchase consideration transferred includes cash consideration, equity consideration, deferred cash consideration, earn-out consideration, (or AWMS earn-out liability), and the 
 110 

payment of assumed liabilities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the AWMS earn-out liability of 1.1 million and 1.1 million is reported in Earn-out liabilities, at fair value, in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, respectively. Since the AWMS earn-out liability meets the definition of a derivative, it is recorded at fair value as a derivative liability on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and measured at fair value at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measuremen t, with changes in fair value to be recognized in Gain (loss) on earn-out liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and in Fair value of earn-out liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the period of change. 
 
 East End Advisors Contingent Consideration 
 
 On April 1, 2024, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding ownership and membership interests of EEA. The EEA Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and the fair value of the total purchase consideration transferred was 93.1 million. Included in the total purchase consideration is estimated contingent consideration of 23.3 million, for which the Company may be required to make additional cash payments contingent on the future EBITDA performance targets between the closing date and the fifth anniversary of the closing date. The contingent consideration was measured at fair value at the acquisition date and recorded as within the Earn-out liabilities line item in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
 
 Pointwise Deferred Consideration 
 
 On May 9, 2024, AlTi acquired the remaining 50 of the issued and outstanding ownership and membership interest of PW, increasing its interest from 50 to 100 . The PW Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and the fair value of the total purchase consideration was 8.0 million. The total purchase consideration transferred includes cash consideration, equity consideration and estimated deferred consideration of 3.3 million. The deferred consideration was measured at fair value at the acquisition date and recorded within the Other liabilities line item in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
 
 Envoi Earn-out Liability 
 
 On July 1, 2024, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Envoi pursuant to the terms of the Envoi Acquisition. The Envoi Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and the fair value of the total purchase consideration transferred was 34.3 million. The total purchase consideration transferred includes estimated contingent consideration totaling 9.0 million, for which the Company may be required to pay additional cash or equity consideration contingent on future revenue-based performance targets between the closing date and the fourth anniversary of the closing date. The Envoi earn-out liability is reported in the Earn-out liabilities, at fair value, in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
 
 Indemnification Arrangements 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that contain indemnities for related parties of the Company, persons acting on behalf of the Company or such related parties and third parties. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements cannot be determined and has not been recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of material loss to be remote. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates, and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our 
 111 

estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates, and/or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates. Actual results may also differ from our estimates and judgments due to risks and uncertainties and changing circumstances, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to geopolitical tensions, changes in market conditions, or other relevant factors. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. For a summary of our significant accounting policies and estimates, see Note 2 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Estimation of Fair Values 
 
 Investments at Fair Value External Strategic Managers: The fair values of our Investments in External Strategic Managers were determined using significant unobservable inputs. The assumptions used could have a material impact on the valuation of these assets and include our best estimates of expected future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate. Changes in the estimated fair values of these assets may have a material impact on our results of operations in any given period, as any decreases in these assets have a corresponding negative impact on our GAAP results of operations in the period in which the changes occur. 
 
 TRA Liability: We carry a portion of our TRA liability at fair value, as it is a contingent consideration related to the Business Combination. The valuation of the TRA liability is sensitive to our expectation of future cash savings that we may ultimately realize related to our tax goodwill and other intangible assets deductions. We then apply a discount rate that we believe is appropriate given the nature of and expected timing of payments of the liability. A decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in an increase in the fair value estimate of the liability, which would have a correspondingly negative impact on our US GAAP results of operations. However, payments under the TRA are ultimately only made to the extent we realize the offsetting cash savings on our income taxes due to the tax goodwill and other intangibles deduction. 
 
 Earn-out Liabilities: The fair values of our Business Combination Earn-out Securities liability, our AWMS earn-out liability, our EEA earn-out liability, our Envoi earn-out consideration liability, and our Envoi earn-out growth consideration liability were determined using various significant unobservable inputs. The assumptions used could have a material impact on the valuation of these liabilities, and include our best estimate of expected volatility, expected holding periods and appropriate discounts for lack of marketability. Changes in the estimated fair values of these liabilities may have material impacts on our results of operations in any given period, as any increases in these liabilities have a corresponding negative impact on our US GAAP results of operations in the period in which the changes occur. See Note 2 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) for additional details. 
 
 Equity-based Compensation: The Company issued stock grants to certain employees as bonus compensation. The fair value of the grants was determined based on the share price on the date of issuance. 
 
 Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in Business Combinations: The determination of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations involves significant judgment and estimation. We utilize various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow approach and market approach, to assess the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities. These valuation methodologies incorporate assumptions regarding future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, useful lives of assets, market multiples, and the realization of tax assets. Additionally, we allocate the purchase price consideration among identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, considering any contingent consideration. The realization of tax assets is assessed based on historical performance, future taxable income projections, and applicable tax laws and regulations. Uncertainties and contingencies inherent in the fair value measurement process are carefully evaluated and disclosed as appropriate to ensure transparency in our financial reporting. 
 
 Fair Value of Reporting Units for Goodwill Impairment Testing: In assessing goodwill impairment, we determine the fair value of reporting units using established valuation methodologies, primarily the discounted 
 112 

cash flow approach and market approach. The income approach involves discounting future cash flows generated by the reporting units, considering key assumptions such as revenue growth rates, discount rates, terminal value calculations, and market multiples. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units, and impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of goodwill to the fair value of the reporting units. We conduct regular assessments for triggering events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate goodwill impairment testing. These disclosures ensure stakeholders understand the methodologies, assumptions, and sensitivities involved in our goodwill impairment testing process. We conduct sensitivity analyses on key inputs and assumptions used in fair value measurements and critical accounting estimates to assess the potential impact on financial results. Changes in assumptions, such as discount rates, growth rates, or market multiples, are carefully evaluated to understand their effect on the fair value of assets, liabilities, or reporting units. Our sensitivity analysis considers a range of potential outcomes and their implications on financial reporting. Mitigating factors and risk management strategies are employed to address uncertainties and enhance the reliability of our financial disclosures. These disclosures provide stakeholders with insight into the robustness of our valuation methodologies and the degree of uncertainty inherent in our financial reporting process. 
 
 Fair Value of Constellation and Allianz Warrants: The fair value of our Constellation and Allianz Warrants use various significant unobservable inputs and was determined by using the Black-Scholes-Merton Model. The assumptions used could have a material impact on the valuation of these liabilities, and include our best estimate of expected volatility, expected holding periods and appropriate discounts for lack of marketability. Changes in the estimated fair values of these liabilities may have material impacts on our results of operations in any given period, as any increases in these liabilities have a corresponding negative impact on our US GAAP results of operations in the period in which the changes occur. 
 
 Fair Value of the Allianz Tranche Right: The fair value of the Allianz Tranche Right uses various significant unobservable inputs and is determined by using the binomial lattice model. The assumptions used could have a material impact on the valuation of this liability and include our best estimate of expected volatility, expected holding periods, and appropriate discounts for lack of marketability. Changes in the estimated fair value of this liability may have a material impact on our results of operations in any given period, as any increase in this liability has a corresponding negative impact on our US GAAP results of operations in the period in which the changes occur. 
 
 Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Receivable: The fair value of contingent consideration receivable uses a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the future share price of the acquirer of LRA. Any implied contingent consideration is discounted using the risk-free rate and the acquirer s estimated credit spread. Changes in any assumptions, such as the discount rate or the estimated credit spread may have a material impact on our results of operations in any given period, as any decrease in this receivable my have a corresponding negative impact on our US GAAP results of operations in the period in which the changes occur. 

Income Taxes 
 Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating income tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We recognize the income tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the positions. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. The Company s income tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether or not we have uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition or de-recognition. 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences, using currently enacted tax rates, of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax 
 113 

basis. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 
 Variable Interest Entities 
 The determination of whether to consolidate a VIE under US GAAP requires a significant amount of judgment concerning the degree of control over an entity by its holders of variable interests. To make these judgments, we conduct an analysis, on a case-by-case basis, of whether we are the primary beneficiary and are therefore required to consolidate an entity. We continually reconsider whether we should consolidate a VIE. Upon the occurrence of certain events, such as modifications to organizational documents and investment management agreements of our products, we will reconsider our conclusion regarding the status of an entity as a VIE. Our judgment when analyzing the status of an entity and whether we consolidate an entity could have a material impact on individual line items within our consolidated financial statements, as a change in our conclusion would have the effect of grossing up the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the entity being evaluated. In light of the relatively insignificant direct and indirect investments into our products, the likelihood of a reasonable change in our estimation and judgment would likely not result in a change in our conclusions to consolidate or not consolidate any VIEs to which we have exposure. 
 
 Impact of Changes in Accounting on Recent and Future Trends 
 The Company has considered all newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to its operations and the preparation of its unaudited condensed consolidated statements, including those it has not yet adopted. We believe that none of the changes to US GAAP that went into effect during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or that have been issued but that we have not yet adopted have substantively impacted our recent trends or are expected to substantively impact our future trends. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Our primary exposure to market risk is related to our role as wealth management advisor to our investment products and the sensitivity to movements in the market value of their investments, including the effect on management fees and investment income. 
 
 Market Risk 
 The market price of investments may significantly fluctuate during the period of investment and should their value decline, our fees may decline accordingly. Investments may decline in value due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries represented in the securities markets. The value of an investment may decline due to general market conditions, which are not specifically related to such investment, such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency rates, or adverse investor sentiment generally. It may also decline due to factors that affect a particular industry or industries, such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry. The impact of changes in market risk on client specific liquidity or overall financial position, may result in client changing the asset holdings, including increasing or decreasing the non-billable portion of their asset portfolios. Such changes will also impact our fees. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 We are party to agreements providing where we provide services, and such transactions contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In such agreements, we depend on the counterparty to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure through reviews of the financial condition of new clients and through collection of fees directly from client portfolios. For clients that generate fees from carried interest and/or preferred return, we periodically review the receivables for collectability and will make appropriate provision for credit losses, should circumstances warrant. 
 114 

Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 131.2 million outstanding under our borrowing agreements, including 40.2 million outstanding on the Term Loan facility and 91.0 million outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility: 
 
 The interest rate on our financing agreements fluctuates with changes in 6-month SOFR, which at September 30, 2024 were 4.81 and 5.52 , respectively. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024, was 9.37 . 
 
 Based on the floating rate component of our financing agreements payable as of September 30, 2024, we estimate that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in increased interest expense of approximately 1.3 million over the next 12 months. 

Exchange Rate Risk 
 We and our funds hold investments that are denominated in foreign currencies that may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between those currencies and the U.S. dollar. Movements in the exchange rate between currencies impact the management fees, carried interest and incentive fees earned by funds with fee paying AUM denominated in foreign currencies as well as by funds with fee paying AUM denominated in U.S. dollars that hold investments denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, movements in the exchange rate impact operating expenses for our global offices that transact in foreign currencies and the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, including cash balances and investments. 
 
 We monitor our exposure to exchange rate risks in the course of our regular operating activities, wherein we utilize payments received in foreign currencies to fulfill obligations in foreign currencies. When appropriate, we will use derivative financial instruments to hedge the net foreign currency exposure from certain direct investments denominated in foreign currencies and the cash flow exposure from our foreign based subsidiaries. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, as further described below in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
 
 As previously disclosed in Part II, Item 9 of our Annual Report, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting relating to the lack of sufficiently documented risk assessments, process level controls and information technology controls that support our financial statements and reporting. Further, management has commenced, but as of September 30, 2024 has not completed its efforts to design and implement a testing plan to determine the effectiveness of controls that support our financial statements and reporting. As a result, several specific material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting remain as of September 30, 2024, as discussed below. 
 
 115 

Management is in the process of implementing a remediation plan for these material weaknesses, including, among other things, hiring additional accounting personnel, completing its efforts to design and implement process level and management review controls and to sufficiently document and implement policies to ensure financial statement disclosures are complete and accurate and to identify and address emerging risks. We cannot reasonably estimate the cost of such remediation plan at this time. We can give no assurance that such efforts will remediate these deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting or that additional material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements, may subject us to litigation and investigations, and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence, cause a decline in the price of the Class A Common Stock and limit our ability to access capital markets. 
 
 The material weaknesses, if not remediated, could result in misstatements of accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual consolidated financial statements or the interim condensed consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 
 Our management anticipates that our internal control over financial reporting will not be effective until the above material weaknesses are remediated. If our remediation of these material weaknesses is not effective, or we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to the Nasdaq listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and the price of our common stock may decline as a result. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 116 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we may be involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits, and claims incidental to the conduct of its business, some of which may be material. Our businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. To our knowledge, other than what we disclosed in the Litigation sections in Note 19 (Commitments and Contingencies) there are no material legal or regulatory proceedings currently pending or threatened against us. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 This section supplements and updates certain of the information found under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report, based on information currently known to us and recent developments since the date of the Annual Report filing. The matters discussed below should be read in conjunction with the risks described in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report. However, the risks and uncertainties that we face are not limited to those described below and those set forth in the Annual Report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 We may face damage to our professional reputation and legal liability if our services are not regarded as satisfactory or for other reasons. 
 
 In recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial advisors and investment managers has been increasing. Our asset management and advisory activities may expose us to the risk of significant legal liabilities to our clients and third parties, including our clients stockholders or beneficiaries, under securities or other laws and regulations for, for example, materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities and other transactions. We make investment decisions on behalf of our clients that could result in substantial losses. Since November 2022, Home REIT and AHRA, which served as its investment advisor until June 30, 2023, have been the subject of allegations regarding Home REIT s operations, stemming from a report issued by a short seller and Home REIT has seen its financial performance materially decline. AlTi was formed on January 3, 2023 through a business combination transaction that included certain legacy Alvarium companies. Although AHRA was sold prior to the business combination and has never been a subsidiary of AlTi, we were required under GAAP to consolidate its results in our financial statements until June 30, 2023, when it was deconsolidated. HLIF pursues a similar investment strategy to Home REIT and its financial performance has similarly declined significantly since the end of 2021. The historic management of these funds by certain legacy Alvarium companies is now the subject of investigations by the UK FCA and, in the case of Home REIT, potential claims are being asserted by its current and former shareholders and, separately, by Home REIT and its directors. We no longer provide services to Home REIT. Notwithstanding this, we or our subsidiaries may potentially suffer reputational damage from the allegations concerning the historic management of Home REIT or HLIF. Further, we may be subject to the risk of legal and regulatory liabilities or actions alleging breach of regulatory rules and/or principles, negligence, misconduct (including deceit), breach of fiduciary duty or breach of contract. In particular, although the UK FCA s investigations concerning the historic management of Home REIT and HLIF have only recently commenced and their outcomes cannot be known or anticipated as at the date of this Quarterly Report, any financial penalties or other adverse outcomes resulting from these investigations may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, if any litigation or other action is commenced against AFM UK and/or ARE in connection with Home REIT, whilst it is not possible at this point in time for us to reliably assess the quantum of such claims, or AFM UK s and ARE s potential exposure, such claims may potentially be material to the Company and, although our intent is for any such claims to be defended, an adverse outcome could have an adverse affect on the business, financial condition or results of operations. These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Significant legal expenses may be incurred in defending 
 117 

litigation and responding to regulatory investigations. In addition, negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the private markets in general, whether or not based in truth, or litigation or regulatory action against us or any third-party managers recommended by us or involving us may tarnish our reputation and harm our ability to attract and retain clients. Substantial legal or regulatory liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 On July 31, 2024, the Company completed the sale to Allianz of (i) 140,000 shares of a newly created class of Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) 19,318,580.96 shares of Class A Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to 250.0 million and issued to Allianz warrants to purchase 5,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, as previously disclosed on the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 31, 2024. 
 
 The securities sold to Allianz were issued without registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon the exemption provided under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act in a transaction not involving any public offering. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 
 a) None. 
 
 b) None. 
 
 c) During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no officers or directors or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.

(b) For purposes of calculating the Total Leverage Ratio, Total Net Leverage Ratio, the Interest Coverage Ratio and Consolidated EBITDA, Specified Transactions that have been completed by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries during any Computation Period, and prior to or simultaneously with the event with respect to which the calculation of any such ratio is being made, shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Specified Transactions had occurred on the first day of such Computation Period. If since the beginning of any Computation Period any Person that subsequently became a Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into Borrower or any other Subsidiary since the beginning of such Computation Period shall have completed any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this Section, then Consolidated EBITDA, the Total Leverage Ratio, Total Net Leverage Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Specified Transaction occurred at the beginning of the applicable Computation Period. (c) Unless otherwise provided, U.S. Dollar baskets set forth in the representations and warranties, covenants and events of default provisions of this Agreement (and other similar baskets; it being understood that this sentence does not apply to Section 2 of this Agreement) are calculated as of each date of measurement by the USD Equivalents thereof as of such date of measurement; provided that if any such baskets are exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in applicable currency exchange rates after the last time such baskets were accessed, such baskets will not be deemed to have been exceeded solely as a result of such fluctuations in currency exchange rates. (d) For purpose of this Section 1.6, Specified Transaction shall mean any merger, acquisition or other investment or any Disposition. (e) Any financial ratios required to be maintained by any Loan Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding-up if there is no nearest number).

Each Letter of Credit shall be issued by an L/C Issuer, but each Lender shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for such Lender s Revolver Percentage of the amount of each drawing thereunder and, accordingly, each Letter of Credit shall constitute usage of the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Lender pro rata in an amount equal to its Revolver Percentage of the L/C Obligations then outstanding. (ii) An L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if: (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to such L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such L/C Issuer shall prohibit or

(b) Applications. At any time before the Revolving Credit Termination Date, the L/C Issuers shall, at the request of Borrower, issue one or more Letters of Credit in U.S. Dollars, in a form satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer, with expiration dates no later than the earlier of 12 months from the date of issuance (or which are cancelable not later than 12 months from the date of issuance and each renewal) or 30 days prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date, in an aggregate face amount as set forth above, upon the receipt of an application duly executed by Borrower and, if such Letter of Credit is for the account of one of its Subsidiaries, such Subsidiary for the relevant Letter of Credit in the form then customarily prescribed by such L/C Issuer for the Letter of Credit requested (each an Application ). Notwithstanding anything contained in any Application to the contrary: (i) Borrower shall pay fees in connection with each Letter of Credit as set forth in Section 2.11, and (ii) if the applicable L/C Issuer is not timely reimbursed for the amount of any drawing under a Letter of Credit on the date such drawing is paid, Borrower s obligation to reimburse such L/C Issuer for the amount of such drawing shall bear interest (which Borrower hereby promises to pay) from and after the date such drawing is paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed). If Borrower so requests in any Application, an L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit such L/C 

-46- Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the applicable L/C Issuer, Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to such L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date which shall comply with this paragraph; provided, however, that such L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) such L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of the last sentence of this clause (b) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is 30 days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from Administrative Agent, any Lender or Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.2 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing such L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. Each L/C Issuer agrees to issue amendments to the Letter(s) of Credit increasing the amount, or extending the expiration date, thereof at the request of Borrower subject to the conditions of Section 4 and the other terms of this Section 2.3. (c) The Reimbursement Obligations. Subject to Section 2.3(b), the obligation of Borrower to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for all drawings under a Letter of Credit (a Reimbursement Obligation shall be governed by the Application related to such Letter of Credit, except that reimbursement shall be made by no later than 3:00 p.m. on the date when each drawing is to be paid if Borrower has been informed of such drawing by the applicable L/C Issuer on or before 11:00 a.m. on the date when such drawing is to be paid or, if notice of such drawing is given to Borrower after 11:00 a.m. on the date when such drawing is to be paid, by no later than 12:00 Noon on the following Business Day, in immediately available funds at Administrative Agent s principal office in Chicago, Illinois, or such other office as Administrative Agent may designate in writing to Borrower (who shall thereafter cause to be distributed to such L/C Issuer such amount(s) in like funds). If Borrower does not make any such reimbursement payment on the date due and the Participating Lenders fund their participations therein in the manner set forth in Section 2.3(e) below, then all payments thereafter received by Administrative Agent in discharge of any of the relevant Reimbursement Obligations shall be distributed in accordance with Section 2.3(e) below. (d) Obligations Absolute. Borrower s obligation to reimburse L/C Obligations as provided in subsection (c) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the relevant Application under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right 

-47- of setoff against, Borrower s obligations hereunder. The responsibility of each L/C Issuer to Borrower and each Lender shall be only to determine that the documents (including each demand for payment) delivered under each Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity in all material respects with such Letter of Credit. None of Administrative Agent, the Lenders, or the L/C Issuers shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the first sentence of this clause (d)), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable L/C Issuer; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the applicable L/C Issuer from liability to Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable Law) suffered by Borrower that are caused by such L/C Issuer s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an L/C Issuer (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment), such L/C Issuer shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, such L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. (e) The Participating Interests. Each Lender (other than the Lender acting as the L/C Issuer in issuing the relevant Letter of Credit), by its acceptance hereof, shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the applicable L/C Issuer, and such L/C Issuer shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably sold to each such Lender (a Participating Lender ), an undivided percentage participating interest (a Participating Interest ), to the extent of its Revolver Percentage, in each Letter of Credit issued by, and each Reimbursement Obligation owed to, such L/C Issuer. Upon any failure by Borrower to pay any Reimbursement Obligation at the time required on the date the related drawing is to be paid, as set forth in Section 2.3(c) above, or if the applicable L/C Issuer is required at any time to return to Borrower or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other Person any portion of any payment of any Reimbursement Obligation, each Participating Lender shall, not later than the Business Day it receives a certificate in the form of Exhibit A from such L/C Issuer (with a copy to Administrative Agent) to such effect, if such certificate is received before 1:00 p.m., or not later than 1:00 p.m. the following Business Day, if such certificate is received after such time, pay to Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer an amount equal to such Participating Lender s Revolver Percentage of such unpaid or recaptured Reimbursement Obligation together with interest on such amount accrued from the date the related payment was made by such L/C Issuer to the date of such payment by such Participating Lender at a rate per annum equal to: (i) from the date the related payment was made by such L/C Issuer to the date two Business Days after payment by such Participating Lender 

-48- is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Rate for each such day and (ii) from the date two Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Participating Lender to the date such payment is made by such Participating Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day. Each such Participating Lender shall thereafter be entitled to receive its Revolver Percentage of each payment received in respect of the relevant Reimbursement Obligation and of interest paid thereon, with such L/C Issuer retaining its Revolver Percentage thereof as a Lender hereunder. The several obligations of the Participating Lenders to the L/C Issuers under this Section 2.3 shall be absolute, irrevocable, and unconditional under any and all circumstances whatsoever and shall not be subject to any set off, counterclaim or defense to payment which any Participating Lender may have or have had against Borrower, any L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person whatsoever. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such obligations shall not be affected by any Default or Event of Default or by any reduction or termination of any Commitment of any Lender, and each payment by a Participating Lender under this Section 2.3 shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. (f) Indemnification. Without duplication of the other indemnification obligations set forth herein, each Loan Party agrees to promptly indemnify the L/C Issuers against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from such L/C Issuer s gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment) that any applicable L/C Issuer may suffer or incur in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it; provided, to the extent the Loan Parties fail to reimburse the L/C Issuers, the Participating Lenders shall, to the extent of their respective Revolver Percentages, promptly indemnify the L/C Issuers for any such amounts. The obligations of the Loan Parties and Participating Lenders under this Section 2.3(f) and all other parts of this Section 2.3 shall be unconditional, irrevocable and survive termination of this Agreement and of all Applications, Letters of Credit, and all drafts and other documents presented in connection with drawings thereunder. (g) Manner of Requesting a Letter of Credit. Borrower shall provide at least five Business Days advance written notice to Administrative Agent of each request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, such notice in each case to be accompanied by an Application for such Letter of Credit properly completed and executed by Borrower and, in the case of an extension or amendment or an increase in the amount of a Letter of Credit, a written request therefor, in a form acceptable to Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuer, in each case, together with the fees called for by this Agreement. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable L/C Issuer of Administrative Agent s receipt of each such notice (and such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to assume that the conditions precedent to any such issuance, extension, amendment or increase have been satisfied unless notified to the contrary by Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders) and such L/C Issuer shall promptly notify Administrative Agent and the Lenders of the issuance of the Letter of Credit so requested. (h) Replacement of any L/C Issuer. Any L/C Issuer may be replaced at any time by written agreement among Borrower, Administrative Agent, the replaced L/C Issuer and the successor L/C Issuer. Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an L/C Issuer. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced L/C Issuer. From and after the effective date of any such replacement (i) the successor L/C Issuer shall have all the rights and obligations of the 

-49- applicable L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term L/C Issuer shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous L/C Issuer, or to such successor and all previous L/C Issuers, as the context shall require. After the replacement of a L/C Issuer hereunder, the replaced L/C Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of a L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. Section 2.4 Applicable Interest Rates. (a) Base Rate Loans. Each Base Rate Loan made or maintained by a Lender shall bear interest (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and the actual days elapsed) on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date such Loan is advanced, or created by conversion from a SOFR Loan, until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect, payable by Borrower on each Interest Payment Date and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise). (b) SOFR Loans. Each SOFR Loan made or maintained by a Lender shall bear interest during each Interest Period it is outstanding (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date such Loan is advanced or continued, or created by conversion from a Base Rate Loan, until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted Term SOFR applicable to such Interest Period, payable by Borrower on each Interest Payment Date and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise). (c) Rate Determinations. Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans and the Reimbursement Obligations hereunder, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive and binding except in the case of manifest error. In connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR, Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Administrative Agent will promptly notify Borrower and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR. Section 2.5 Minimum Borrowing Amounts; Maximum SOFR Loans. Each Borrowing of Base Rate Loans advanced under a Credit shall be in an amount not less than 100,000. Each Borrowing of SOFR Loans advanced, continued or converted under a Credit shall be in an amount equal to 1,000,000 or such greater amount which is an integral multiple of 500,000. Without Administrative Agent s consent, there shall not be more than 10 Borrowings of SOFR Loans outstanding hereunder at any one time. 

-50- Section 2.6 Manner of Borrowing Loans and Designating Applicable Interest Rates. (a) Notice to Administrative Agent. Borrower shall give notice to Administrative Agent by no later than 10:00 a.m.: (i) at least three (3) Business Days before the date on which Borrower requests the Lenders to advance a Borrowing of SOFR Loans and (ii) at least one Business Day before the date Borrower requests the Lenders to advance a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. The Loans included in each Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate specified in such notice of a new Borrowing. Thereafter, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Borrower may from time to time elect to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Borrowing or, subject to the minimum amount requirement for each outstanding Borrowing set forth in Section 2.5, a portion thereof, as follows: (i) if such Borrowing is of SOFR Loans, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, Borrower may continue part or all of such Borrowing as SOFR Loans or convert part or all of such Borrowing into Base Rate Loans or (ii) if such Borrowing is of Base Rate Loans, on any Business Day, Borrower may convert all or part of such Borrowing into SOFR Loans for an Interest Period or Interest Periods specified by Borrower. Borrower shall give all such notices requesting the advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing to Administrative Agent by telephone, telecopy, or other telecommunication device acceptable to Administrative Agent (which notice shall be irrevocable once given and, if by telephone, shall be promptly confirmed in writing), substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (Notice of Borrowing) or Exhibit C (Notice of Continuation/Conversion), as applicable, or in such other form acceptable to Administrative Agent. Notice of the continuation of a Borrowing of SOFR Loans for an additional Interest Period or of the conversion of part or all of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans into SOFR Loans must be given by no later than 10:00 a.m. at least three (3) Business Days before the date of the requested continuation or conversion. All such notices concerning the advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing shall specify the date of the requested advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), the amount of the requested Borrowing to be advanced, continued or converted, the type of Loans to comprise such new, continued or converted Borrowing and, if such Borrowing is to be comprised of SOFR Loans, the Interest Period applicable thereto. Upon notice to Borrower by Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, in the case of an Event of Default under Section 8.1(j) or 8.1(k) with respect to Borrower, without notice), no Borrowing of SOFR Loans shall be advanced, continued, or created by conversion if any Default or Event of Default then exists. Borrower agrees that Administrative Agent may rely on any such telephonic, telecopy or other telecommunication notice given by any person Administrative Agent in good faith believes is an Authorized Representative without the necessity of independent investigation, and in the event any such notice by telephone conflicts with any written confirmation such telephonic notice shall govern if Administrative Agent has acted in reliance thereon. (b) Notice to the Lenders. Administrative Agent shall give prompt telephonic, telecopy or other telecommunication notice to each Lender of any notice from Borrower received pursuant to Section 2.6(a) above and the amount of such Lender s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing. (c) Borrower s Failure to Notify. If Borrower fails to give notice pursuant to Section 2.6(a) above of the continuation or conversion of any outstanding principal amount of a Borrowing of SOFR Loans prior to the last day of its then current Interest Period within the period required by Section 2.6(a) and such Borrowing is not prepaid in accordance with Section 2.8(a), such 

-51- Borrowing shall automatically be converted to a Base Rate Loan. In the event Borrower fails to give notice pursuant to Section 2.6(a) above of a Borrowing equal to the amount of a Reimbursement Obligation and has not notified Administrative Agent by 12:00 noon on the day such Reimbursement Obligation becomes due that it intends to repay such Reimbursement Obligation through funds not borrowed under this Agreement, Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Credit on such day in the amount of the Reimbursement Obligation then due, which Borrowing shall be applied to pay the Reimbursement Obligation then due. (d) Disbursement of Loans. Not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of any requested advance of a new Borrowing, subject to Section 4, each Lender shall make available its Loan comprising part of such Borrowing in funds immediately available at the principal office of Administrative Agent in Chicago, Illinois (or at such other location as Administrative Agent shall designate). Administrative Agent shall make all such funds so received available to Borrower at Administrative Agent s principal office in Chicago, Illinois (or at such other location as Administrative Agent shall designate) or by depositing or wire transferring such proceeds as Borrower and Administrative Agent may otherwise agree. (e) Administrative Agent Reliance on Lender Funding. Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender prior to (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, by 1:00 p.m. on) the date on which such Lender is scheduled to make payment to Administrative Agent of the proceeds of a Loan (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such Lender does not intend to make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such payment when due and Administrative Agent may (but shall not be required to) in reliance upon such assumption make available to Borrower the proceeds of the Loan to be made by such Lender and, if any Lender has not in fact made such payment to Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, on demand, pay to Administrative Agent the amount made available to Borrower attributable to such Lender together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was made available to Borrower and ending on (but excluding) the date such Lender pays such amount to Administrative Agent at a rate per annum equal to: (i) from the date the related advance was made by Administrative Agent to the date two Business Days after payment by such Lender is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Rate for each such day and (ii) from the date two Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Lender to the date such payment is made by such Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day. If such amount is not received from such Lender by Administrative Agent immediately upon demand, Borrower will, on demand, repay to Administrative Agent the proceeds of the Loan attributable to such Lender with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan, but without such payment being considered a payment or prepayment of a Loan under Section 3.3 so that Borrower will have no liability under such Section with respect to such payment. Section 2.7 Maturity of Loans. (a) Scheduled Payments of Term Loans. Borrower shall make principal payments on the Term Loans on each date set forth below in the aggregate principal amount set forth opposite such date (as adjusted from time to time pursuant to Section 2.8): 

-52- Date Amount Last day of each calendar quarter beginning March 31, 2023 through and including December 31, 2024 1,250,000 Last day of calendar quarter beginning March 31, 2025 through and including December 31, 2025 1,875,000 Last day of each calendar quarter beginning March 31, 2026 and thereafter 2,500,000 it being agreed that a final payment comprised of all principal and interest then outstanding on the Term Loans shall be due and payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date, the final maturity thereof. Each such principal payment shall be applied to the Lenders holding the Term Loans pro rata based upon their Term Loan Percentages. (b) Revolving Loans. Each Revolving Loan, both for principal and interest then outstanding, shall mature and be due and payable by Borrower on the Revolving Credit Termination Date. Section 2.8 Prepayments. (a) Optional Prepayments. Borrower may prepay in whole or in part (but, if in part, then: (i) if such Borrowing is of Base Rate Loans, in an amount not less than 100,000, (ii) if such Borrowing is of SOFR Loans, in an amount not less than 500,000, and (iii) in each case, in an amount such that the minimum amount required for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.5 remains outstanding) any Borrowing of SOFR Loans at any time upon three (3) Business Days prior notice by Borrower to Administrative Agent or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, upon one Business Day prior notice delivered by Borrower to Administrative Agent (or, in any case, such shorter period of time then agreed to by Administrative Agent), such prepayment, in each case, to be made by the payment of the principal amount to be prepaid and, in the case of any SOFR Loans, accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for prepayment plus any amounts due the Lenders under Section 3.3. The amount of each such prepayment pursuant to this clause (a) shall be applied as directed by Borrower or, absent any such direction, to the remaining amortization payments on the Term Loans in the direct order of maturity until paid in full and then to the Revolving Credit without a corresponding reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitments. (b) Mandatory Prepayments. (i) If Borrower or any Subsidiary shall at any time or from time to time make or agree to make a Disposition or shall suffer an Event of Loss, then Borrower shall promptly notify Administrative Agent of such proposed Disposition or Event of Loss (including the amount of the estimated Net Cash Proceeds to be received by Borrower or such Subsidiary in respect thereof) and, promptly upon receipt by Borrower or such Subsidiary (and in any event within three Business Days after receipt) of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Disposition or Event of Loss, Borrower shall prepay the Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to 100 of the amount of all such Net Cash Proceeds; provided 

-53- that with respect to any Disposition other than a Specified Asset Sale (x) so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, this subsection shall not require any such prepayment with respect to Net Cash Proceeds received on account of an Event of Loss so long as such Net Cash Proceeds are to acquire (or replace or rebuild) real property, equipment or other tangible assets (excluding inventory) to be used in the business of the Loan Parties, (y) this subsection shall not require any such prepayment with respect to Net Cash Proceeds received on account of Dispositions or Events of Loss during any fiscal year of Borrower not exceeding the greater of 7,000,000 or 10 of Consolidated EBITDA in the aggregate so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, and (z) in the case of any Disposition not covered by clause (y) above, so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, if Borrower states in its notice of such event that Borrower or the relevant Subsidiary intends to reinvest, within 12 months of the applicable Disposition, the Net Cash Proceeds thereof in assets similar to the assets which were subject to such Disposition, then Borrower shall not be required to make a mandatory prepayment under this subsection in respect of such Net Cash Proceeds to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds are actually reinvested in assets related to its business within such time period.

The amount of each such prepayment shall be applied first to the outstanding Term Loans (to be applied to the remaining amortization payments on the Term Loans in the inverse order of maturity) until paid in full and then to the Revolving Credit without a corresponding reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitments. Borrower acknowledges that its performance hereunder shall not limit the rights and remedies of the Lenders for any breach of Section 7.1 or Section 8.1(i) or any other terms of the Loan Documents. (iii) Borrower shall, on each date the Revolving Credit Commitments are reduced pursuant to Section 2.14, prepay the Revolving Loans, and, if necessary, prefund

(c) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, that the failure of Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms. In the event of any conflict between the records maintained by any Lender and the records maintained by Administrative Agent in such matters, the records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. (d) Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a promissory note or notes in the forms of Exhibit D-1 (each such promissory note, a Term Note or Exhibit D-2 (each such promissory note, a Revolving Note ), as applicable (the Term Notes and the Revolving Notes being hereinafter referred to collectively as the Notes and individually as a Note ).

(b) Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may (but shall not be required to) in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due.

All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in L/C Obligations shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolver Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans, participations in Reimbursement Obligations of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Commitment. Subject to Section 11.27, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. (v) Cash Collateral.

-61- behalf of Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. (c) New Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no L/C Issuer shall be required to issue, extend, increase, reinstate or renew any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.

(c) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section or Section 2.16 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein. (d) Termination of Requirement. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce an L/C Issuer s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by Administrative Agent and each L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to Section 2.16 the Person providing Cash Collateral and the applicable L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations and provided further that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by Borrower, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents.

If Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer, or any Lender pays any amount in respect of any Indemnified Taxes, Borrower or such Guarantor shall reimburse Administrative Agent, such L/C Issuer or such Lender for that payment on demand in the currency in which such payment was made. If Borrower or such Guarantor pays any such Taxes, penalties or interest, it shall deliver official tax receipts evidencing that payment or certified copies thereof to the Lender, the L/C Issuer or Administrative Agent on whose account such withholding or deduction was made (with a copy to Administrative Agent if not the recipient of the original) on or before the thirtieth day after payment. (b) U.S. Withholding Tax Exemptions. Each Lender or L/C Issuer that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, submit to Borrower and Administrative Agent on or before the date the initial Credit Event is made hereunder or, if later, the date such financial institution becomes a Lender or L/C Issuer hereunder, two duly completed and signed copies of (i) either Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (relating to such Lender or L/C Issuer and entitling it to a complete exemption or a reduced rate from withholding under the Code on all amounts to be received by such Lender or L/C Issuer, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Obligations) or Form W- 8ECI (relating to all amounts to be received by such Lender or L/C Issuer, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Obligations) or Form W-8IMY (together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law) of the United States Internal Revenue Service or (ii) solely if such Lender is claiming exemption from United States withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of portfolio interest , a Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, and a certificate representing that such Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the 

-65- Code, is not a 10 percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of Borrower and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code). On or before the date the initial Credit Event is made hereunder or, if later, the date such financial institution becomes a Lender or L/C Issuer hereunder or upon the request of Borrower or Administrative Agent, each Lender and L/C Issuer that is a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit to Borrower and Administrative Agent two duly completed and sign copies of Form W-9. Thereafter and from time to time, each Lender and L/C Issuer shall submit to Borrower and Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one or the other of such Forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) and such other certificates as may be (i) requested by Borrower in a written notice, directly or through Administrative Agent, to such Lender or L/C Issuer and (ii) required under then current United States law or regulations to avoid or reduce United States withholding taxes on payments in respect of all amounts to be received by such Lender or L/C Issuer, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents or the Obligations. (c) Inability of Lender to Submit Forms. If any Lender or L/C Issuer determines, as a result of any change in applicable Law, regulation or treaty, or in any official application or interpretation thereof, that it is unable to submit to Borrower or Administrative Agent any form or certificate that such Lender or L/C Issuer is obligated to submit pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.1 or that such Lender or L/C Issuer is required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously submitted or any such form or certificate otherwise becomes ineffective or inaccurate, such Lender or L/C Issuer shall promptly notify Borrower and Administrative Agent of such fact and the Lender or L/C Issuer shall to that extent not be obligated to provide any such form or certificate and will be entitled to withdraw or cancel any affected form or certificate, as applicable. Section 3.2 Other Taxes. Borrower agrees to pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. Section 3.3 Funding Indemnity. If any Lender shall incur any loss, cost or expense (including any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or re-employment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund or maintain any SOFR Loan or the relending or reinvesting of such deposits or amounts paid or prepaid to such Lender) as a result of: (a) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a SOFR Loan on a date other than the last day of its Interest Period, (b) any failure (because of a failure to meet the conditions of Section 4 or otherwise) by Borrower to borrow or continue a SOFR Loan, or to convert a Base Rate Loan into a SOFR Loan on the date specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 2.6(a), (c) any failure by Borrower to make any payment of principal on any SOFR Loan when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), or 

-66- (d) any acceleration of the maturity of a SOFR Loan as a result of the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder, then, upon the demand of such Lender, Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amount as will reimburse such Lender for such loss, cost or expense. If any Lender makes such a claim for compensation, it shall provide to Borrower, with a copy to Administrative Agent, a certificate setting forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in reasonable detail (including an explanation of the basis for and the computation of such loss, cost or expense) and the amounts shown on such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower absent manifest error. Section 3.4 Change in Law. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, if at any time any Change in Law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof makes it unlawful for any Lender to make or continue to maintain any SOFR Loans or to perform its obligations as contemplated hereby, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to Borrower and such Lender s obligations to make or maintain SOFR Loans under this Agreement shall be suspended until it is no longer unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain SOFR Loans. Borrower shall prepay on demand the outstanding principal amount of any such affected SOFR Loans, together with all interest accrued thereon and all other amounts then due and payable to such Lender under this Agreement; provided, that, subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Borrower may then elect to borrow the principal amount of the affected SOFR Loans from such Lender by means of Base Rate Loans from such Lender, which Base Rate Loans shall not be made ratably by the Lenders but only from such affected Lender and which shall be determined without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate . Upon any such repayment, Borrower shall also pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.3. Section 3.5 Inability to Determine Rates. Subject to Section 3.8, if, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any SOFR Loan: (a) Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or (b) the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, and the Required Lenders have provided notice of such determination to Administrative Agent, then Administrative Agent will promptly so notify Borrower and each Lender. Upon notice thereof by Administrative Agent to Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make or continue SOFR Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans and, in the case of a SOFR Loan, the affected Interest Periods) until Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans and, in the case of a SOFR Loan, the affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have 

-67- been converted into Base Rate Loans immediately or, in the case of a SOFR Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such conversion, Borrower shall also pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.3. Section 3.6 Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If any Change in Law: (i) shall subject any Lender (or its Lending Office) or any L/C Issuer to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its SOFR Loans, its Notes, its Letter(s) of Credit, or its participation in any thereof, any Reimbursement Obligations owed to it or its obligation to make SOFR Loans, issue a Letter of Credit, or to participate therein, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender (or its Lending Office) or any L/C Issuer of the principal of or interest on its SOFR Loans, Letter(s) of Credit, or participations therein or any other amounts due under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in respect of its SOFR Loans, Letter(s) of Credit, any participation therein, any Reimbursement Obligations owed to it, or its obligation to make SOFR Loans, or issue a Letter of Credit, or acquire participations therein (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender or its Lending Office or any L/C Issuer imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s principal executive office or Lending Office is located); or (ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (including any such requirement imposed by the FRB) or any L/C Issuer or shall impose on any Lender (or its Lending Office) or any L/C Issuer or on the interbank market any other condition affecting its SOFR Loans, its Notes, its Letter(s) of Credit, or its participation in any thereof, any Reimbursement Obligation owed to it, or its obligation to make SOFR Loans, or to issue a Letter of Credit, or to participate therein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender (or its Lending Office) or such L/C Issuer of making or maintaining any SOFR Loan, issuing or maintaining a Letter of Credit, or participating therein, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its Lending Office) or such L/C Issuer under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Lender or L/C Issuer to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Lender or L/C Issuer (with a copy to Administrative Agent), Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such Lender or L/C Issuer such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer for such increased cost or reduction. (b) If any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or L/C Issuer or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s or L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or L/C Issuer capital or on the capital of such Lender s or L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or L/C Issuer or such Lender s or L/C Issuer s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or L/C Issuer s policies and the policies of such 

-68- Lender s or L/C Issuer s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer or such Lender s or L/C Issuer s holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) A certificate of a Lender or L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. Section 3.7 Lending Offices. Each Lender may, at its option, elect to make its Loans hereunder at the branch, office or affiliate specified on the appropriate signature page hereof (each a Lending Office for each type of Loan available hereunder or at such other of its branches, offices or affiliates as it may from time to time elect and designate in a written notice to Borrower and Administrative Agent. To the extent reasonably possible, a Lender shall designate an alternative branch or funding office with respect to its SOFR Loans to reduce any liability of Borrower to such Lender under Section 3.6 or to avoid the unavailability of SOFR Loans under Section 3.5, so long as such designation is not otherwise disadvantageous to the Lender. Section 3.8 Effect of Benchmark Transition Event. (a) Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (a) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis. (b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

Any determination, decision or election that may be made by Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 3.8, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 3.8. (d) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the administrator of such Benchmark or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (e) Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans. During a Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of Base Rate.

All of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests of Borrower and each Subsidiary are validly issued and outstanding and fully paid and non-assessable and all such shares and other equity interests indicated on Schedule 5.2 as owned by a Loan Party are owned, beneficially and of record, by Borrower or such Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens other than Liens permitted by Section 7.2 and the Liens granted in favor of Administrative Agent pursuant to the Collateral Documents.

Administrative Agent shall also act as the collateral agent under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacity as a potential obligee of any Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability) and the L/C Issuers hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender and such L/C Issuer for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto (including to enter into additional Loan Documents or supplements to existing Loan Documents on behalf of the Secured Parties). In this connection, Administrative Agent, as collateral agent and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 9 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising 

-108- any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of Sections 9 and 11 (including Section 11.13, as though such co- agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the collateral agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. Section 9.2 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Administrative Agent, and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. Section 9.3 Action by Administrative Agent/Sustainability Coordinator. Neither Administrative Agent nor the Sustainability Coordinator shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Administrative Agent nor Sustainability Coordinator (a) shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that Administrative Agent or the Sustainability Coordinator is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that neither Administrative Agent nor the Sustainability Coordinator shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose Administrative Agent or the Sustainability Coordinator, as applicable, to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law and (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent, Sustainability Coordinator or any of their respective Affiliates in any capacity. Administrative Agent and the Sustainability Coordinator shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder or under any other Loan Document unless it first receives such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders) as it deems appropriate and any further assurances of its indemnification from the Lenders that it may require, including prepayment of any related expenses and any other protection it requires against any and all costs, expense, and liability which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Administrative Agent and the Sustainability Coordinator shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans. 

-109- Section 9.4 Consultation with Experts.

Section 9.5 Liability of Administrative Agent and Sustainability Coordinator; Credit Decision. (a) Neither Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Coordinator nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in connection with the Loan Documents: (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment. Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to Administrative Agent in writing by Borrower, a Lender or an L/C Issuer. Neither Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Coordinator nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify: (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Credit Event, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of Borrower or any Subsidiary contained herein or in any other Loan Document; (iv) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Section 4, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to Administrative Agent or the Sustainability Coordinator, as applicable; or (v) the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, perfection, value, worth or collectability hereof or of any other Loan Document or of any other documents or writing furnished in connection with any Loan Document or of any Collateral; and neither Administrative Agent nor the Sustainability Coordinator makes any representation of any kind or character with respect to any such matter mentioned in this sentence. (b) Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, increase, reinstatement or renewal of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such L/C Issuer unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. In particular and without limiting any of the foregoing, Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for confirming the accuracy of any Compliance Certificate or other document or instrument received by it under the Loan Documents. Administrative Agent may treat the payee of any Obligation as the holder thereof until written notice of transfer shall have been filed with Administrative Agent signed by such payee in form satisfactory to Administrative Agent. Each 

-110- Lender and L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has independently and without reliance on Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Coordinator or any Lender or L/C Issuer (or any of their Related Parties), and based upon such information, investigations and inquiries as it deems appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to extend credit to Borrower in the manner set forth in the Loan Documents. It shall be the responsibility of each Lender and L/C Issuer to keep itself informed as to the creditworthiness of Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and neither Administrative Agent nor the Sustainability Coordinator shall have any liability to any Lender or L/C Issuer with respect thereto. (c) In addition, neither Administrative Agent nor the Sustainability Coordinator (x) shall have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or otherwise independently verify any informational materials focused on ESG targets to be used in connection the credit facility describe in this Agreement, including any information based upon the information provided by Borrower with respect to the applicable KPI s and (y) shall have any responsibility for (or liability in respect of) the completeness or accuracy of any such information. Each party hereto hereby agrees that Administrative Agent shall not have any responsibility for (or liability in respect of) reviewing, auditing or otherwise evaluating any ESG Applicable Rate Adjustment (or any of the data or computations that are part of or related to any such calculation) set forth in any sustainability certificate or notice as to a sustainability certificate inaccuracy (and Administrative Agent and the Sustainability Coordinator may rely conclusively on any such certificate or notice, without further inquiry). Section 9.6 Indemnity. To the extent that Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under Section 11.13 to be paid by it to Administrative Agent (or any sub- agent thereof), any L/C Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), such L/C Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender s pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought based on each Lender s Percentage at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender); provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent an L/C Issuer in its capacity as such), or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), an L/C Issuer in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement. Administrative Agent shall be entitled to offset amounts received for the account of a Lender under this Agreement against unpaid amounts due from such Lender to Administrative Agent or any L/C Issuer hereunder (whether as fundings of participations, indemnities or otherwise, and with any amounts offset for the benefit of Administrative Agent to be held by it for its own account and with any amounts offset for the benefit of a L/C Issuer to be remitted by Administrative Agent to or for the account of such L/C Issuer), but shall not be entitled to offset against amounts owed to Administrative Agent or any L/C Issuer by any Lender arising outside of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

-118- (a) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver, or release in respect of any obligation of any Loan Party or other obligor or of any other guarantor under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or by operation of law or otherwise; (b) any modification or amendment of or supplement to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement relating to any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) any change in the corporate existence, structure, or ownership of, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, or other similar proceeding affecting, any Loan Party or other obligor, any other guarantor, or any of their respective assets, or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Loan Party or other obligor or of any other guarantor contained in any Loan Document; (d) the existence of any claim, set off, or other rights which any Loan Party or other obligor or any other guarantor may have at any time against Administrative Agent, any Lender, any L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether or not arising in connection herewith; (e) any failure to assert, or any assertion of, any claim or demand or any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights or remedies against any Loan Party or other obligor, any other guarantor, or any other Person or Property; (f) any application of any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any obligation of any Loan Party or other obligor, regardless of what obligations of Borrower or other obligor remain unpaid; (g) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any Loan Party or other obligor or any other guarantor for any reason of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document or any agreement relating to any Guaranteed Obligations or any provision of applicable Law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by any Loan Party or other obligor or any other guarantor of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any Reimbursement Obligation or any other amount payable under the Loan Documents or any agreement relating to any Guaranteed Obligations; or (h) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by Administrative Agent, any Lender, any L/C Issuer, or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 10. Section 10.3 Discharge Only upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in Certain Circumstances. Until such time as Payment in Full occurs, each Guarantor s obligations under this Section 10 shall remain in full force and effect. If at any time any payment of any Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of Borrower or other obligor or of any guarantor, or otherwise, each Guarantor s obligations under this Section 10 with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had become due but had not been made at such time. Section 10.4 Subrogation. Until such time as Payment in Full occurs, each Guarantor agrees it will not exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation by any payment 

-119- made hereunder, or otherwise. If any amount shall be paid to a Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior to Payment in Full occurring, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of Administrative Agent, the Lenders, and the L/C Issuers (and their Affiliates) and shall forthwith be paid to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and L/C Issuer (and their Affiliates) or be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Section 10.5 Waivers. Each Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest, and any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by Administrative Agent, any Lender, any L/C Issuer, or any other Person against any Loan Party or other obligor, another guarantor, or any other Person. Section 10.6 Limit on Recovery. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10, the amount guaranteed by each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the extent, if any, required so that its obligations hereunder shall not be subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, Uniform Voidable Transactions Act or similar statute or common law. In determining the limitations, if any, on the amount of any Guarantor s obligations hereunder pursuant to the preceding sentence, it is the intention of the parties hereto that any rights of subrogation, indemnification or contribution which such Guarantor may have under this Section 10, any other agreement or applicable law shall be taken into account. Section 10.7 Contribution. (a) To the extent that any Guarantor shall make a payment under this Section 10 (a Guarantor Payment which, taking into account all other Guarantor Payments then previously or concurrently made by any other Guarantor, exceeds the amount which otherwise would have been paid by or attributable to such Guarantor if each Guarantor had paid the aggregate Guaranteed Obligations satisfied by such Guarantor Payment in the same proportion as such Guarantor s Allocable Amount (as defined below) (as determined immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment) bore to the aggregate Allocable Amounts of each of the Guarantors as determined immediately prior to the making of such Guarantor Payment, then, following indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guarantor Payment and the occurrence of Payment in Full, such Guarantor shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments from, and be reimbursed by, each other Guarantor for the amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment. (b) As of any date of determination, the Allocable Amount of any Guarantor shall be equal to the excess of the fair saleable value of the property of such Guarantor over the total liabilities of such Guarantor (including the maximum amount reasonably expected to become due in respect of contingent liabilities, calculated, without duplication, assuming each other Guarantor that is also liable for such contingent liability pays its ratable share thereof), giving effect to all payments made by other Guarantors as of such date in a manner to maximize the amount of such contributions. (c) This Section 10.7 is intended only to define the relative rights of the Guarantors, and nothing set forth in this Section 10.7 is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the 

-120- Guarantors, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Section 10. (d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution and indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets of the Guarantor or Guarantors to which such contribution and indemnification is owing. (e) The rights of the indemnifying Guarantors against other Guarantors under this Section 10.7 shall only be exercisable upon the occurrence of Payment in Full. Section 10.8 Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by any Loan Party or other obligor under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or under any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations, is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such Loan Party or such obligor, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or under any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations, shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by Administrative Agent made at the request of the Required Lenders. Section 10.9 Benefit to Guarantors. The Guarantors are engaged in related businesses and integrated to such an extent that the financial strength and flexibility of each Guarantor has a direct impact on the success of each other Guarantor. Each Guarantor will derive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the extensions of credit hereunder. Section 10.10 Guarantor Covenants. Each Guarantor shall take such action as Borrower is required by this Agreement to cause such Guarantor to take, and shall refrain from taking such action as Borrower is required by this Agreement to prohibit such Guarantor from taking. Section 10.11 United Kingdom Guarantee Limitations. Without limiting any specific exemptions set out below or in the Agreement and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary: (a) no obligations and liabilities of a UK Guarantor under Section 10 of this Agreement and under any other guarantee or indemnity provision in a Loan Document (the Limited Guarantee Obligations will extend to include any obligation or liability; and (b) no Collateral granted by a UK Guarantor will secure any Limited Guarantee Obligation, in each case of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), if and to the extent doing so would be unlawful financial assistance (including within the meaning of sections 678 or 679 of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to members of the group of companies to which the Borrower belongs that are organized, formed or incorporated in the United Kingdom or any equivalent provision of any other applicable law and notwithstanding any applicable exemptions and/or undertaking of any applicable prescribed whitewash or similar financial assistance procedures) in respect of the acquisition of shares in itself or its holding company or a member of the group of companies to which the Borrower belongs under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. 

-121- If, notwithstanding the above, the giving of the guarantee in respect of the Limited Guarantee Obligations or Lien would be unlawful financial assistance, then, to the extent necessary to give effect to the above (and only to the extent legally effective in the relevant jurisdiction), the obligations under the Loan Documents will be deemed to have been split into two tranches; Tranche 1 comprising those obligations which can be secured by the Limited Guarantee Obligations or Lien without breaching or contravening relevant financial assistance laws and Tranche 2 comprising the remainder of the obligations under the Loan Documents. The Tranche 2 obligations will be excluded from the relevant Limited Guarantee Obligations. SECTION 11. MISCELLANEOUS Section 11.1 No Waiver, Cumulative Remedies. No delay or failure on the part of Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer, or any Lender, or on the part of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations, in the exercise of any power or right under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof or as an acquiescence in any default, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. The rights and remedies hereunder of Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, the Lenders, and of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which any of them would otherwise have. Section 11.2 Non-Business Days. If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day on which date such payment shall be due and payable. In the case of any payment of principal falling due on a day which is not a Business Day, interest on such principal amount shall continue to accrue during such extension at the rate per annum then in effect, which accrued amount shall be due and payable on the next scheduled date for the payment of interest. Section 11.3 Survival of Representations. All representations and warranties made herein or in any other Loan Document or in certificates given pursuant hereto or thereto shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the date as of which they were made as long as any credit is in use or available hereunder. Section 11.4 Survival of Indemnity and Certain Other Provisions. All indemnity provisions and other provisions relative to reimbursement to the Lenders and L/C Issuer of amounts sufficient to protect the yield of the Lenders and L/C Issuer with respect to the Loans and Letters of Credit, including, but not limited to, Sections 3.3, 3.6, and 11.13, shall survive Payment in Full, and shall remain in force beyond the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations and payment or satisfaction in full of any single claim thereunder. All such indemnity and other provisions shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each Loan Party and shall inure to the benefit of each applicable Indemnitee and its successors and assigns. Section 11.5 Sharing of Set Off. Each Lender agrees with each other Lender a party hereto that if such Lender shall receive and retain any payment, whether by set off or application of deposit balances or otherwise, on any of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations in excess of its ratable share of payments on all such Obligations then outstanding to the Lenders, then such 

-122- Lender shall purchase for cash at face value, but without recourse, ratably from each of the other Lenders such amount of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations, or participations therein, held by each such other Lenders (or interest therein) as shall be necessary to cause such Lender to share such excess payment ratably with all the other Lenders; provided, that if any such purchase is made by any Lender, and if such excess payment or part thereof is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the related purchases from the other Lenders shall be rescinded ratably and the purchase price restored as to the portion of such excess payment so recovered, but without interest. For purposes of this Section, amounts owed to or recovered by any L/C Issuer in connection with Reimbursement Obligations in which Lenders have been required to fund their participation shall be treated as amounts owed to or recovered by such L/C Issuer as a Lender hereunder.

Section 11.8 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon Borrower, the Guarantors and the other Loan Parties and their successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of Administrative Agent, each L/C Issuer, and each of the Lenders, and their respective successors and assigns, including any subsequent holder of any of the Obligations.

Section 11.9 Participants. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, Borrower or Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person, or Borrower or any of Borrower s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) Borrower, Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 9.6 with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s). Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso of Section 11.11 that affects such Participant. Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1 through 3.4 and 3.6 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant Section 11.10; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.15 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.6, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.15 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.14 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 11.5 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the 

-125- Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. Section 11.10 Assignments. (a) Assignments Generally. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) Minimum Amounts. (A) In the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Commitment and the Loans and participation interest in L/C Obligations at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and (B) in any case not described in subsection (a)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans and participation interest in L/C Obligations outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans and participation interest in L/C Obligations of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to Administrative Agent or, if Effective Date is specified in the Assignment and Acceptance, as of the Effective Date) shall not be less than 5,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of the Revolving Credit, or 1,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of any Term Loan, unless each of Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Credits on a non-pro rata basis. (iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by Section 11.10(a)(i)(B) and, in addition: (A) the consent of Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (y) such assignment is to a 

-126- Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice thereof; (B) the consent of Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of (i) the Revolving Credit if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender with a Commitment in respect of such facility, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender or (ii) the Term Loans to a Person who is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; and (C) in respect of the Revolving Credit, the consent of each L/C Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). (iv) Assignment and Acceptance. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of 3,500 (provided that Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment) and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. (v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to (A) Borrower or any of Borrower s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute a Defaulting Lender or a Subsidiary thereof. (vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person). (vii) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of Borrower and Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent, each L/C Issuer and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Revolver Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee 

-127- of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.10(b), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 11.4 and 11.13 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 11.9. (b) Register. Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Chicago, Illinois, a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and Borrower, Administrative Agent, and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (c) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or grant to a FRB, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or grant of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or secured party for such Lender as a party hereto; provided further, however, the right of any such pledgee or grantee (other than any FRB) to further transfer all or any portion of the rights pledged or granted to it, whether by means of foreclosure or otherwise, shall be at all times subject to the terms of this Agreement. (d) Buybacks. Any Lender may, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations with respect to its Term Loans under this Agreement to Borrower (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates) through (x) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of commencement thereof, Dutch auctions open to all Lenders on a pro rata basis in accordance with the Auction Procedures or (y) notwithstanding Sections 2.12 and 11.5 or any other provision in this Agreement and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall be continuing at the time of the entry into a binding agreement with respect to such open market purchase, open market purchase on a non-pro rata basis; provided that that the participating Lender and Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Auction Manager an assignment agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit J-2 hereto (an 

-128- Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption in lieu of an Assignment and Assumption; provided further, that: (i) the principal amount of such Term Loans, along with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, so contributed, assigned or transferred to Borrower shall be deemed automatically irrevocably repaid, terminated, cancelled, extinguished and of no further force and effect on the date of such contribution, assignment or transfer, and Borrower shall neither obtain nor have any rights as a Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents by virtue of such assignment, (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term Loans of the remaining Lenders shall reflect such cancellation and extinguishing of the Term Loans then held by Borrower, and (iii) Borrower shall promptly provide notice to Administrative Agent of such contribution, assignment or transfer of such Loans, and Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such notice, shall reflect the cancellation of the applicable Term Loans in the Register; provided further, that Borrower shall not have any material non-public information with respect to any Loan Parties that either (I) has not been disclosed to the Lenders on or prior to the date of any initiation of an auction Borrower under this clause (d) or (II) if not disclosed to the Lenders, would reasonably be expected to have a material effect upon, or otherwise be material to, (x) a Lender s decision to participate in any such auction or (y) the market price of the relevant Term Loans.

Section 11.17 Severability of Provisions. Any provision of any Loan Document which is unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. All rights, remedies and powers provided in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable mandatory provisions of law, and all the provisions of this Agreement and other Loan Documents are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of law which may be controlling and to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement or the other Loan Documents invalid or unenforceable. Section 11.18 Excess Interest. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, no such provision shall require the payment or permit the collection of any amount of interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted by applicable Law to be charged for the use or detention, or the forbearance in the collection, of all or any portion of the Loans or other obligations outstanding under this Agreement or any other Loan Document Excess Interest ).

-133- against Administrative Agent or any Lender for any damages whatsoever arising out of the payment or collection of any Excess Interest.

Section 11.19 Construction. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Loan Documents shall not be construed more favorably in favor of any party hereto based upon which party drafted the same, it being acknowledged that all parties hereto contributed substantially to the negotiation of the Loan Documents.
