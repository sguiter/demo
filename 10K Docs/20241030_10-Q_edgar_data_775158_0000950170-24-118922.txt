million in indebtedness of customers. At September 30, 2024, the Company estimated that its maximum loss exposure under these contracts was million . Terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years. Under the terms of these agreements and upon the occurrence of certain events, the Company generally has the ability to, among other things, take possession of the underlying collateral. If the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate and result in their inability to make payments, then loss provisions in excess of amounts provided for at inception may be required. Given the Company s position as original equipment manufacturer and its knowledge of end markets, the Company, when called upon to fulfill a guarantee, generally has been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss, if any, to the Company. While the Company does not expect to experience losses under these agreements that are materially in excess of the amounts reserved, it cannot provide any assurance that the financial condition of the third parties will not deteriorate resulting in the third parties inability to meet their obligations. In the event that this occurs, the Company cannot guarantee that the collateral underlying the agreements will be sufficient to avoid losses materially in excess of the amounts reserved. Any losses under these guarantees would generally be mitigated by the value of any underlying collateral, including financed equipment. During periods of economic weakness, collateral values generally decline and can contribute to higher exposure to losses. Residual Value Guarantees: The Company is party to multiple agreements whereby at September 30, 2024 the Company guaranteed to support an aggregate of million of customer equipment value. At September 30, 2024, the Company estimated that its maximum loss exposure under these contracts was million . Terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company guarantees that a piece of equipment will have a minimum residual value at a future date. If the counterparty is not able to recover the agreed upon residual value through sale, or alternative disposition, the Company is responsible for a portion of the shortfall. The Company is generally able to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with these guarantees by staggering the maturity terms of the guarantees, diversification of the portfolio and leveraging knowledge gained through the Company s

Other Matters - The Company is subject to environmental matters and legal proceedings and claims, including patent, antitrust, product liability, warranty and state dealership regulation compliance proceedings, that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the final results of such matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Actual results could vary, among other things, due to the uncertainties involved in litigation. Major contracts for government customers are performed over extended periods of time and are subject to changes in scope of work and delivery schedules. Pricing negotiations on changes and settlement of claims often extend over prolonged periods of time. The Company s ultimate profitability on such contracts may depend on the eventual outcome of an equitable settlement of contractual issues with the Company s customers.

Table of Contents 

General 
 Major products manufactured and marketed by each of the Company s business segments are as follows: 
 Access aerial work platforms and telehandlers used in a wide variety of construction, industrial, institutional and general maintenance applications to position workers and materials at elevated heights. Access customers include equipment rental companies, construction contractors, manufacturing companies and home improvement centers. The Access segment also manufacturers carriers and wreckers sold to towing companies. 
 Vocational custom and commercial firefighting vehicles and equipment, aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) vehicles, simulators, mobile command and control vehicles and other emergency vehicles primarily sold to fire departments, airports and other governmental units; refuse collection vehicles sold to commercial and municipal waste haulers; aviation ground support products, gate equipment and airport services provided to commercial airlines, airports, air-freight carriers, ground handling customers and the military; front-discharge concrete mixers sold to ready-mix companies; and field service vehicles and truck-mounted cranes sold to mining, construction and other companies. 
 Defense tactical vehicles, trailers, weapons system integration and parts sold to the U.S. military and to other militaries around the world and delivery vehicles for the USPS. 
 In July 2024, the Company moved the reporting responsibility for Pratt Miller from its Defense segment to the Chief Technology and Strategic Sourcing Officer to better utilize Pratt Miller s expertise across the entire Oshkosh Corporation enterprise. Pratt Miller results are now reported within "Corporate and other" and historical information has been recast to reflect the change. 
 Overview 
 The Company reported another solid quarter, with growth in both revenue and operating income. Diluted earnings per share was 2.75 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.79 in the third quarter of 2023. The Company's performance was highlighted by growth in sales and operating income in the Vocational segment, where demand remained strong and backlog continued to grow. 
 Although the Access segment is experiencing softer market conditions in North America, the Company believes the market remains healthy and in the third quarter of 2024 the segment grew sales by 3.4 and reported strong double digit operating income margins. While the Company believes that mega projects and fleet ages will be favorable factors for the Access segment, pockets of slowing non-residential construction activity and persistently higher interest rates have recently been putting pressure on access equipment demand in North America. The Company is working with its access equipment customers on their 2025 requirements and continues to expect meaningful access equipment orders during the fourth quarter of 2024 and first quarter of 2025. 
 Consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased 231.5 million, or 9.2 , to 2.74 billion compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to improved organic sales volume in all three segments, an additional month of AeroTech sales and improved pricing. 
 Consolidated operating income increased 3.8 to 266.2 million, or 9.7 of sales, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 256.5 million, or 10.2 of sales, in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the impact of higher gross margin associated with the higher sales volume and improved price/cost dynamics, offset in part by the higher selling, general and administrative and engineering costs. 
 The Company completed the acquisition of AUSACORP S.L. (AUSA), a European manufacturer of specialty equipment including wheeled dumpers, rough terrain forklifts and telehandlers, within the Access segment for 114.0 million during the third quarter of 2024. The acquisition supports the Company's accelerated growth strategy, strengthens the Access segment's equipment portfolio and enhances the Company's ability to serve customers globally. AUSA is a market leader in Spain, which serves adjacent new markets for Oshkosh, including vegetation management, expands the Company's agricultural presence and complements the Access segment's traditional access equipment markets.

In light of the softer access equipment markets in North America, the Company is reducing its full year 2024 earnings per share estimate to be approximately 10.00 per share compared to its most recent estimate of 10.45. The earnings per share estimate includes after-tax charges of 0.70 per share related to amortization of purchased intangibles, 0.60 per share related to intangible asset impairments in the second quarter of 2024 and 0.05 related to the amortization of inventory step-up from an acquisition during the third quarter. Excluding these items, the Company estimates full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 11.35 per share compared to its most recent estimate of 11.75. The Company expects net sales to be approximately 10.6 billion in 2024, compared to its most recent estimate of 10.7 billion. 
 The Company now expects Access segment 2024 sales to be approximately 5.1 billion and operating margin to be approximately 15.75 , compared to the Company s most recent estimates of 5.3 billion and 16.25 , respectively. The reduced expectations are a result of the softer access equipment market conditions in North America.

Third Quarter 2024 Compared to 2023 
 Defense segment net sales increased primarily due to Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV) production for the USPS and higher sales volume for the Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles (FHTV), the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) and aftermarket parts, offset in part by lower Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) volume. 
 The decrease in gross margin in the Defense segment was primarily due to unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on contracts in the third quarter of 2024 (210 basis points) and higher engineering costs (50 basis points), offset in part by lower charges related to inventory (140 basis points). 
 Operating income in the Defense segment declined as a result of the unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on contracts 11 million) and the absence of a gain on the sale of a business 8 million), offset in part by higher gross margin associated with higher sales volume 9 million). 
 First Nine Months 2024 Compared to 2023 
 Defense segment net sales increased primarily due to higher sales volumes for the FMTV, aftermarket parts and the FHTV and initial sales of NGDVs for the USPS (which commenced in the second quarter of 2024), offset in part by lower JLTV program volume. JLTV production under the Company's domestic JLTV contract is expected to conclude in early 2025 as the domestic follow-on contract was awarded to another company. The domestic JLTV contract accounted for 661 million of sales in the first nine months of 2024. An increase in NGDV revenues is expected to exceed the impact of the decline of JLTV revenues in 2025. 
 The gross margin in the Defense segment remained relatively flat in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 as favorable mix (110 basis points) was offset by adverse production variances (70 basis points) and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on contracts (40 basis points). 
 Operating income in the Defense segment improved due to the impact of higher gross margin associated with higher sales volume 24 million) and improved product mix 18 million), offset in part by adverse production variances 11 million), higher unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on contracts 10 million) and the absence of a gain on the sale of a business 8 million).

 Cash Flows 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 Operating activities used 240.7 million of cash in the first nine months of 2024 compared to providing 120.0 million of cash during the first nine months of 2023. Higher net income and non-cash adjustments during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 were more than offset by increases in working capital. Cash used in operations in the first nine months of 2024 included cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds of 364.9 million, which increased by 242.3 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to the Company's generation of significantly higher pre-tax income in 2023 compared to 2022. Cash used in operations during the first nine months of 2024 included the payment of 2023 incentive compensation 111 million), which was higher than 2022 incentive compensation due to the Company's improved performance. Other changes in working capital also impacted cash used in operations, including increases in inventory in the Access and Vocational segments as well as lower customer advances and the normalization of accounts payable due to more timely invoice processing. The Company expects to generate approximately 625 million of cash flows from operations in 2024 compared to the Company's most recent estimate of 675 million. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Investing activities used cash of 309.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1.19 billion during the first nine months of 2023.

approximately 10.7 million shares of Common Stock remaining under its repurchase authorization. In the first nine months of 2023, the Company repurchased 265,795 shares of its Common Stock at an aggregate cost of 22.6 million. 
 Liquidity 
 Senior Credit Agreement 
 On March 23, 2022, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility that matures in March 2027 with an initial maximum aggregate amount of availability of 1.1 billion. On April 3, 2024, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to increase the maximum aggregate amount of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by 450 million to 1.55 billion. At September 30, 2024, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of 934.5 million and specified outstanding letters of credit of 24.5 million reduced available capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility to 591.0 million. 
 Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay (i) an unused commitment fee ranging from 0.080 to 0.225 per annum of the average daily unused portion of the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the Credit Agreement and (ii) a fee ranging from 0.438 to 1.500 per annum of the maximum amount available to be drawn for each letter of credit issued and outstanding under the Credit Agreement. 
 Covenant Compliance 
 The Credit Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintain a leverage ratio at certain levels, subject to certain exceptions, restrictions on the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to consolidate or merge, create liens, incur additional subsidiary indebtedness and consummate acquisitions and a restriction on the disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant contained in the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 and expects to be able to meet the financial covenant contained in the Credit Agreement over the next twelve months.

 Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company s debt as of September 30, 2024. 
 Application of Critical Accounting Policies

The accounting policies that the Company believes are most critical to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations are reported in Item 7 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

New Accounting Standards 
 See Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards. 
 Customers and Backlog 
 Sales to the U.S. government comprised approximately 20 of the Company s net sales in the first nine months of 2024. No other single customer accounted for more than 10 of the Company s net sales for this period. A substantial majority of the Company s net sales are derived from the fulfillment of customer orders that are received prior to commencing production. 
 The Company s backlog at September 30, 2024 decreased 9.0 to 14.32 billion compared to 15.73 billion at September 30, 2023. Access segment backlog decreased 46.4 to 2.13 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 3.98 billion at September 30, 2023. The decrease in backlog is believed to primarily be the result of the normalization of orders in connection with improved product availability and slowing demand in North America. Vocational segment backlog increased 18.2 to 5.91 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 5.00 billion at September 30, 2023 due to strong demand for fire apparatus and price increases. Defense segment backlog decreased 7.3 to 6.21 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 6.70 billion at September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the wind-down of production under the Company's domestic JLTV contract. 
 Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenues that the Company anticipates from customer contracts that have been awarded and/or are in progress. Reported backlog includes the original contract amount and any contract modifications that have been agreed upon. Reported backlog excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed and any potential future contract modifications. Backlog is comprised of fixed and variable priced contracts that may be canceled, modified or otherwise changed in the future. As a result, backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. Backlog information and comparisons thereof as of different dates may not be accurate indicators of future sales or the ratio of the Company s future sales to the DoD versus its sales to other customers. Approximately 84 of the Company s September 30, 2024 backlog is not expected to be filled in 2024. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The Company is forecasting earnings per share excluding items that affect comparability. When the Company forecasts earnings per share, excluding items, this is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes excluding the impact of these items is useful to investors to allow a more accurate comparison of the Company s operating performance to prior year results. However, while forecasted adjusted earnings per share excludes amortization of purchased intangibles, intangible asset impairments and amortization of inventory step-up, revenue and earnings of acquired companies are reflected in forecasted adjusted earnings per share and intangible assets contribute to the generation of revenue and earnings. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company s results or forecasts prepared in accordance with GAAP. The table below presents a reconciliation of the Company s presented non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure:

ITEM 4.	 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, the Company s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, with the exception of those changes related to the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system within the Defense segment, which occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
