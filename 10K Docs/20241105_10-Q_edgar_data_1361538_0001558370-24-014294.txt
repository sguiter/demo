Fees associated with the Facility for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were million and are included in interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Under the Facility, certain of our designated subsidiaries may sell their trade accounts receivable as they are originated to a wholly owned bankruptcy remote Special Purpose Entity SPE created specifically for this purpose. We control and, therefore, consolidate the SPE in our consolidated financial statements. The SPE transfers ownership and control of qualifying accounts receivable to PNC and Regions up to the maximum purchase commitment. We and our related subsidiaries have no continuing involvement in the transferred accounts receivable, other than collection and administrative responsibilities, and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy our creditors or our related subsidiaries. We account for accounts receivable sold to the banking counterparty as a sale of financial assets and derecognize the trade accounts receivable from our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total outstanding balance of trade accounts receivable that have been sold and derecognized is million as of September 30, 2024. The SPE owned million of trade accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024, which are included in Accounts receivable, net on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 million, and million, respectively, of our revenue is derived from contracts where scope is adequately defined, and therefore we can reasonably estimate total contract value. For these contracts, revenue is recognized over time as work is completed because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer (typically using an input measure such as costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress). For certain contracts, where scope is not adequately defined and we cannot reasonably estimate total contract value, revenue is recognized either on an input basis, based on contract costs incurred as defined within the respective contracts, or an output basis, based on units completed. Costs to obtain contracts are generally not significant and are expensed in the period incurred. We evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single performance obligation and whether a single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , defines a performance obligation as a contractual promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our evaluation requires significant judgment and the decision to combine a group of contracts or separate a contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and, therefore, is not distinct. However, occasionally we have contracts with multiple performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract s transaction price to each performance obligation using the observable standalone selling price, if available, or alternatively our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach for each performance obligation. As of September 30, 2024, we had billion of remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize of our remaining performance obligations as revenue during the next and substantially all of the remaining balance in the to thereafter. Accounting for long-term contracts involves the use of various techniques to estimate total transaction price and costs. For long-term contracts, transaction price, estimated cost at completion and total costs incurred to date are used to calculate revenue earned. Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract. Total estimated costs, and thus contract revenue and income, can be impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation, politics and pandemics may affect the progress of a project s completion, and thus the timing of revenue recognition. To the extent that original cost estimates are modified, estimated costs to complete increase, delivery schedules are delayed, or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded, cash flow, revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected. The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including contract modifications (change orders and claims), liquidated damages, volume discounts, performance bonuses, incentive fees, and other terms that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent we believe we have an enforceable right, and it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Our estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price

 million as a result of changes in estimates associated with performance obligations satisfied prior to June 30, 2024. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was negatively impacted by million as a result of changes in estimates associated with performance obligations satisfied prior to December 31, 2023. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full, including the reversal of any previously recognized profit, in the period it is identified and recognized as an accrued loss provision which is included in Contract liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For contract revenue recognized over time, the accrued loss provision is adjusted so that the gross profit for the contract remains zero in future periods. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately million of unapproved contract modifications included in the aggregate transaction prices. These contract modifications were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. Approximately million of the contract modifications had been recognized as revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis through September 30, 2024. In all forms of contracts, we estimate the collectability of contract amounts at the same time that we estimate project costs. If we anticipate that there may be issues associated with the collectability of the full amount calculated as the transaction price, we may reduce the amount recognized as revenue to reflect the uncertainty associated with realization of the eventual cash collection. For example, when a cost reimbursable project exceeds the client s expected budget amount, the client frequently requests an adjustment to the final amount. Similarly, some utility clients reserve the right to audit costs for significant periods after performance of the work. The timing of when we bill our customers is generally dependent upon agreed-upon contractual terms, milestone billings based on the completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Sometimes, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in unbilled revenue, which is a contract asset. Also, we sometimes receive advances or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in deferred revenue, which is a contract liability. The caption Contract assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets represents the following: unbilled revenue, which arises when revenue has been recorded but the amount will not be billed until a later date; retainage amounts for the portion of the contract price earned by us for work performed, but held for payment by the customer as a form of security until we reach certain construction milestones; and contract materials for certain job specific materials not yet installed, which are valued using the specific identification method relating to the cost incurred to a specific project.

 Retention receivable Contract materials (not yet installed) Contract assets decreased by million compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower unbilled revenue partially offset by higher retention receivable. The caption Contract liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets represents the following: deferred revenue, which arises when billings are in excess of revenue recognized to date; and the accrued loss provision. Accrued loss provision Contract liabilities increased by million compared to December 31, 2023, due to higher deferred revenue. Revenue recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that was included in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2023, was approximately million.

Each of these contract types has a different risk profile. Typically, we assume more risk with fixed-price contracts. Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular fixed-price contract. However, these types of contracts offer additional profits when we complete the work for less cost than originally estimated. Unit-price and cost reimbursable contracts generally subject us to lower risk. Accordingly, the associated fees are usually lower than fees earned on fixed-price contracts. Under these contracts, our profit may vary if actual costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates.

On August 1, 2022, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement ), which increased our term loan to an aggregate principal amount of million (the Term Loan and increased our revolving credit facility to million (the Revolving Credit Facility ), under which the lenders agreed to make loans on a revolving basis from time to time and to issue letters of credit for up to the million committed amount. The maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement is August 1, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, commercial letters of credit outstanding were million. There were outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, and available borrowing capacity was million as of September 30, 2024. The Amended Credit Agreement contains various restrictive and financial covenants including, among others, a net senior debt/EBITDA ratio and minimum EBITDA to cash interest ratio. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement includes restrictions on investments, change of control provisions and provisions in the event we dispose of more than of our total assets. We were in compliance with the covenants for the Amended Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 On January 31, 2023, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to the fluctuations in variable interest rates. The swap effectively exchanged the interest rate on million of the debt outstanding under our Term Loan from variable to a fixed rate of per annum, plus an applicable margin, which was as of September 30, 2024.

 million. The swap was not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. The swap effectively changes the variable-rate cash flow exposure on the debt obligations to fixed rates. The fair value of outstanding interest rate swap derivatives can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total notional amount of swap derivatives outstanding and fluctuations in market interest rates compared to the interest rates fixed by the swap. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, our outstanding interest rate swap agreement contained a notional amount of million maturing on January 31, 2025. Credit Risk. By using derivative instruments to economically hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of a counterparty to perform under the terms of a derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, we do not possess credit risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties. We have entered into netting agreements, including International Swap Dealers Association ISDA Agreements, which allow for netting of contract receivables and payables in the event of default by either party. Interest rate swap Other long-term assets Cash flows from derivatives settled are reported as cash flows from operating activities. . For the nine months of 2024 and 2023, our tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of state income taxes and nondeductible components of per diem expenses. Our U.S. federal income tax returns are generally no longer subject to examination for tax years before 2020. The statutes of limitation of state and foreign jurisdictions generally vary between 3 to 5 years. Accordingly, our state and foreign income tax returns are generally no longer subject to examination for tax years before 2018. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based upon consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income, the length

There were and restricted stock units, net of forfeitures for tax withholdings, converted to common stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Employee Stock Purchase Plan In May 2022, our shareholders approved the 2022 Primoris Services Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ), for which eligible full-time employees can purchase shares of our common stock at a discount. The purchase price of the stock is of the lower of the market price at the beginning of the offering period or the end of the offering period. Purchases occur semi-annually, approximately following the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31 of each year, but in no cases can extend beyond March 31 of the period or year, and approximately following the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30 of each year. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, shares were purchased at an average discounted purchase price of per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, shares were purchased at an average discounted purchase price of per share. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, shares were purchased at an average discounted purchase price of per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, shares were purchased at an average discounted purchase price of per share. Share Purchase Plan In November 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a million share purchase program. Under the share purchase program, we can, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors, acquire shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In November 2023, our Board of Directors replenished the limit to million and extended the program to December 31, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not purchase any shares of common stock. . The exercise of lease extensions is at our sole discretion. Periodically, we sublease excess facility space, but any sublease income is generally not significant. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Third Quarter 2024 Report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Introduction We are one of the leading providers of infrastructure services operating mainly in the United States and Canada. We provide a wide range of construction, maintenance, replacement, fabrication, and engineering services to a diversified base of customers through our two segments: Utilities and Energy. The structure of our reportable segments is generally focused on broad end-user markets for our services. The Utilities segment operates throughout the United States and specializes in a range of services, including the installation and maintenance of new and existing natural gas and electric utility distribution and transmission systems, and communications systems. The Energy segment operates throughout the United States and Canada and specializes in a range of services that include engineering, procurement, construction, refining, site development services for data centers, liquified natural gas plant construction, highway and bridge construction, demolition, site work, soil stabilization, mass excavation, flood control, upgrades, repairs, outages, pipeline construction and maintenance, pipeline integrity services, and maintenance services for entities in the renewable energy and energy storage, renewable fuels, and petroleum and petrochemical industries, as well as state departments of transportation. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for a number of large natural gas transmission and petrochemical companies in the United States, major electrical and gas projects for a number of large utility companies in the United States, significant renewable energy projects for energy companies, as well as projects for our engineering customers. We enter into a large number of contracts each year, and the projects can vary in length from daily work orders to as long as 36 months, and occasionally longer, for completion on larger projects. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer in any year, a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenue in any given year. We generate revenue under a range of contracting types, including fixed-price, unit-price, time and material, and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts, each of which has a different risk profile. A portion of our revenue is derived from contracts where scope is adequately defined, and therefore we can reasonably estimate total contract value. For these contracts, revenue is recognized over time as work is completed because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer (typically using an input measure such as costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress). For certain contracts, where scope is not adequately defined and we can t reasonably estimate total contract value, revenue is recognized either on an input basis, based on contract costs incurred as defined within the respective contracts, or an output basis based on units completed. Costs to obtain contracts are generally not significant and are expensed in the period incurred. The classification of revenue and gross profit for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Our segments may perform services across industries or perform joint services for customers in multiple industries. To determine reportable segment gross profit, certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, equipment costs and indirect operating expenses were made. Material trends and uncertainties We generate our revenue from construction and engineering projects, as well as from providing a variety of infrastructure services. We depend in part on spending by companies in the communications, gas and electric utilities, energy, chemical, and pipeline industries, as well as state departments of transportation. Over the past several years, each segment has benefited from demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy and power facilities, more reliable gas and electric utility infrastructure, and upgraded and expanded local highway and bridge needs. However, periodically, each of these industries and government agencies is adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions and other challenging market conditions, such as those that have caused declines in the pipeline industry. Economic and other factors outside of our control may affect the amount and size of contracts we are awarded in any particular period.

 We actively monitor the impact of the dynamic macroeconomic environment, including the impact of inflation and volatility in the commodities markets, on all aspects of our business. We have experienced increased fuel and labor costs and anticipate that elevated levels of cost inflation could persist in 2024. In an effort to mitigate the impacts of inflation on our operations, we attempt to recover increases in the cost of labor, equipment, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions that allow us to adjust billing rates for certain major contracts annually; by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work; or by entering into back-to-back contracts with suppliers and subcontractors. However, the annual adjustment provided by certain contracts is typically subject to a cap and there can be an extended period of time between the impact of inflation on our costs and when billing rates are adjusted. In some cases, our actual cost increases have exceeded the contractual caps, and therefore negatively impacted our operations. We have been successful in renegotiating some of our major contracts to address the increased costs on future work and will continue to address this with our customers going forward. Fluctuations in the market prices of oil, gas and other fuel sources have affected demand for our services. Volatility in the prices of oil, gas, and liquid natural gas that has occurred in the past few years has created uncertainty with respect to demand for our pipeline services, both in the near term and for future projects. While the construction of gathering lines within the oil shale formations may remain at lower levels for an extended period, we believe that over time, the need for pipeline infrastructure for mid-stream and gas utility companies will result in a continuing need for our services. The continuing changes in the regulatory environment have affected the demand for our services, either by increasing our work, delaying projects, or cancelling projects. For example, environmental laws and regulations have provided challenges to pipeline projects, resulting in delays or cancellations that impact the timing of revenue recognition. However, environmental laws and new pipeline regulations could increase the demand for our pipeline maintenance and integrity services. In addition, the regulatory environment in certain states has resulted in delays for the construction of gas-fired power plants. However, the increased demand for renewable resources is also creating demand for our infrastructure services and additional opportunities for our Energy segment, such as the need for battery storage and the construction of utility scale solar facilities. We are exposed to certain market risks related to changes in interest rates. To monitor and manage these market risks, we have established risk management policies and procedures. Our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan bear interest at a variable rate which exposes us to interest rate risk. From time to time, we may use certain derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 300.0 million of our variable rate debt outstanding was economically hedged. Based on our variable rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, a 1.0 increase or decrease in interest rates would change annual interest expense by approximately 5.4 million. Seasonality, cyclicality and variability Our results of operations are subject to quarterly variations. Some of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice, snow, and named storms, which can impact our ability to perform infrastructure services. These seasonal impacts can affect revenue and profitability in all of our businesses. Any quarter can be affected either negatively, or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of the country. In addition, demand for new projects in our Utilities segment tends to be lower during the early part of the calendar year due to clients internal budget cycles. As a result, we usually experience higher revenue and earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first quarter. Our project values range in size from several hundred dollars to several hundred million dollars. The bulk of our work is comprised of project sizes that average less than 3.0 million. We also perform construction projects which tend not to be seasonal, but can fluctuate from year to year based on customer timing, project duration, weather, and general economic conditions. Our business may be affected by declines, or delays in new projects, or by client project schedules. Because of the cyclical nature of our business, the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods, and our financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter. Results from one quarter may not be indicative of our financial condition, or operating results for any other quarter, or for an entire year. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the 

 27 

Table of Contents 
 disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and that affect the amounts of revenue and expenses reported for each period. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available, is dependent on future events, or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Often, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates, and our estimates could change if they were made under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023. Results of Operations Consolidated Results The following discussion compares the results of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue Revenue was 1,649.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 119.6 million, or 7.8 , compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to growth in both our Energy and Utilities segments. Revenue was 4,625.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 425.7 million, or 10.1 , compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to growth in our Energy segment partially offset by a decrease in our Utilities segment. Gross Profit Gross profit was 198.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 24.7 million, or 14.2 , compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue in both segments and improved margins in our Utilities segment. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 12.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.4 for the same period in 2023 primarily driven by an increase in margins in our Utilities segment. Gross profit was 518.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 87.8 million, or 20.4 , compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue in our Energy segment and improved margins in both segments. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 11.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.3 for the same period in 2023, primarily driven by improved margins in both segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses were 98.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 13.7 million, or 16.2 , compared to 2023 primarily due to increased people costs to support revenue growth as well as higher technology costs associated with ongoing initiatives. SG A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 5.9 compared to 5.5 for the corresponding period in 2023. SG A expenses were 286.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 38.8 million, or 15.7 , compared to 2023 primarily due to increased people costs to support revenue growth as well as higher technology costs associated with ongoing initiatives. SG A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 6.2 compared to 5.9 for the corresponding period in 2023.

Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 3.5 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower average debt balances, partially offset by a 1.2 million unrealized loss on our interest rate swap in 2024 compared to a 3.0 million unrealized gain in 2023. Provision for income taxes We are subject to tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions. We determine our best estimate of the annual effective tax rate at each interim period using expected annual pre-tax earnings, statutory tax rates and available tax planning opportunities. Certain significant or unusual items are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur, which can cause variability in the effective tax rate from quarter to quarter. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, as income tax expense. The effective tax rate for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, of 29.0 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to the impact of state income taxes and nondeductible components of per diem expenses. We recorded income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 51.8 million compared to income tax expense of 36.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 15.7 million increase in income tax expense is driven by a 54.1 million increase in pretax income.

These impacts were partially offset by completion of a major substation project in our power delivery market in the second half of 2023. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 22.4 million, or 34.6 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to improved margins and higher revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 13.1 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.9 in the same period in 2023, primarily due to productivity issues on some legacy projects from our PLH Group, Inc. PLH acquisition experienced in 2023, strong performance in our power delivery market in 2024, and the increased benefit of higher margin storm work in 2024. Energy Segment Revenue increased by 123.1 million, or 13.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased renewable energy activity. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 2.3 million, or 2.1 , compared to the same period in 2023, due to higher revenue, partially offset by lower margins. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11.0 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.3 in the same period in 2023. This was primarily due to higher pipeline margins on a mid-Atlantic project in 2023 that did not repeat in 2024, partially offset by strong performance on multiple industrial projects in 2024.

Partially offsetting the overall decline was increased project work in our power delivery market and increased activity in our communications market. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 13.4 million, or 8.2 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased margins, partially offset by a decrease in revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 10.0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.0 in the same period in 2023, primarily due to productivity issues on some legacy projects from our PLH acquisition experienced in 2023, strong performance in our power delivery market in 2024, and the increased benefit of higher margin storm work in 2024. Energy Segment Revenue increased by 537.8 million, or 22.5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased renewable energy and industrial activity, partially offset by decreased activity in our pipeline market. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 74.3 million, or 27.9 , compared to the same period in 2023, due to higher revenue and margins. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 11.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.1 in the same period in 2023, primarily due to revenue growth in higher margin renewable energy work and strong performance by our industrial group in 2024. These amounts were partially offset by higher pipeline margins on a mid-Atlantic project in 2023 that did not repeat in 2024.

 Geographic area financial information The majority of our revenue is derived from customers in the United States with approximately 4.9 generated from sources outside of the United States during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, principally in Canada. Backlog For infrastructure services contractors, backlog can be an indicator of future revenue streams. Different companies define and calculate backlog in different manners. We define backlog as anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts where scope is adequately defined, and therefore we can reasonably estimate total contract value Fixed Backlog ), and the estimated revenue on Master Service Agreements MSA work MSA Backlog ). We present two measures of backlog; one that includes Fixed Backlog and MSA Backlog for the next twelve months, and total backlog that includes all Fixed Backlog and MSA Backlog to the end of the MSA agreement. We do not consider renewals when estimating MSA Backlog. We do not include certain contracts in the calculation of fixed backlog where scope, and therefore contract value, is not adequately defined. We estimate MSA Backlog based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts and estimates of customer demand based on information from our customers. Fixed and MSA Backlog by reporting segment at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were as follows (in millions): 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Next 12 Months Total Next 12 Months Total Utilities Fixed Backlog 57.6 57.6 96.3 96.3 MSA Backlog 1,892.4 5,268.4 1,776.5 5,093.6 Backlog 1,950.0 5,326.0 1,872.8 5,189.9 Energy Fixed Backlog 3,049.8 5,518.5 2,599.0 5,102.6 MSA Backlog 199.4 416.6 308.2 602.4 Backlog 3,249.2 5,935.1 2,907.2 5,705.0 Total Fixed Backlog 3,107.4 5,576.1 2,695.3 5,198.9 MSA Backlog 2,091.8 5,685.0 2,084.7 5,696.0 Backlog 5,199.2 11,261.1 4,780.0 10,894.9 Backlog should not be considered a comprehensive indicator of future revenue, as a percentage of our revenue is derived from projects that are not part of a backlog calculation. The backlog estimates include amounts from estimated MSAs, but our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase an amount of services from us under the MSAs. Any of our contracts may be terminated by our customers on relatively short notice. In the event of a project cancellation, we are typically reimbursed for all of our costs through a specific date, as well as all reasonable costs associated with demobilizing from the jobsite, but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in backlog. Projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time as a result of customer delays, regulatory requirements or project specific issues. Future revenue from projects where scope, and therefore contract value, is not adequately defined may not be included in our estimated backlog amount. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity represents our ability to pay our liabilities when they become due, fund business operations, and meet our contractual obligations and execute our business plan. Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash balances at the beginning of each period and our cash flows from operating activities. If needed, we have availability under our lines of credit to augment liquidity needs, and we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Our short-term and long-term cash requirements consist primarily of working capital, investments to support revenue growth and maintain our equipment and facilities, general corporate needs, and to service our debt obligations. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, commercial letters of credit outstanding were 52.8 million, and available borrowing capacity was 272.2 million. In addition there were no outstanding borrowings under our Canadian credit facilities as of

 September 30, 2024, commercial letters of credit outstanding were 1.0 million in Canadian dollars and available borrowing capacity was 13.0 million in Canadian dollars. In June 2023, we entered into an Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility the Facility with PNC Bank, National Association to improve cash flows from trade accounts receivable. In July 2024 we renewed the Facility for a two-year term, added Regions Bank to the Facility, and increased the maximum purchase commitment to 150.0 million, at any one time. Under the Facility, certain of our designated subsidiaries may sell their trade accounts receivable as they are originated to a wholly owned bankruptcy remote Special Purpose Entity created specifically for this purpose. The total outstanding balance of trade accounts receivable that have been sold and derecognized is 75.0 million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had 75.0 million in available capacity under the Facility. In order to maintain sufficient liquidity, we evaluate our working capital requirements on a regular basis. We may elect to raise additional capital by issuing common stock, convertible notes, term debt or increasing the borrowing capacity under our credit facilities as necessary to fund our operations or to fund the acquisition of new businesses. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled 352.7 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 217.8 million as of December 31, 2023. We anticipate that our cash and investments on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, access to and capacity under a shelf registration statement, and our future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our operating needs, our planned capital expenditures, and settle our commitments and contingencies for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. The construction industry is capital intensive, and we expect to continue to make capital expenditures to meet anticipated needs for our services. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we spent approximately 98.3 million for capital expenditures, which included 60.9 million on our facilities and 34.2 million for construction equipment. Capital expenditures for the remaining three months of 2024 are expected to total between 10.0 million and 20.0 million, which includes 5.0 million to 15.0 million for equipment. Cash Flows Cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change in cash: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 210,054 (7,147) Net cash used in investing activities (891) (25,621) Net cash used in financing activities (74,022) (60,023) Effect of exchange rate changes (400) 346 Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 134,741 (92,445) Operating Activities The cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands): 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Operating Activities: Net income 126,922 88,486 38,436 Depreciation and amortization 72,948 81,454 (8,506) Changes in assets and liabilities 33,838 (154,984) 188,822 Gain on sale of property and equipment (38,490) (29,603) (8,887) Other 14,836 7,500 7,336 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 210,054 (7,147) 217,201 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 210.1 million compared to 7.1 million cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change year-

Table of Contents 
 over-year was primarily due to improvement in the impact from the changes in assets and liabilities and an increase in net income. The significant components of the 33.8 million change in assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are summarized as follows: Contract liabilities increased 290.6 million, primarily due to higher deferred revenue from favorable billing terms on certain new projects; 
 Contract assets decreased by 39.5 million, primarily due to the timing of billing our customers; Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by 32.5 million primarily due to revenue growth and the timing of our payments to vendors; and 
 Accounts receivable increased by 263.2 million, primarily due to increased revenue and the timing of collecting from our customers. 
 The significant components of the 155.0 million change in assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, are summarized as follows: Accounts receivable increased by 185.8 million, primarily due to increased revenue and the timing of collecting from our customers; Contract assets increased by 128.4 million, primarily due to increased revenue; Contract liabilities increased by 106.0 million, primarily due to higher deferred revenue; Other current assets decreased by 33.0 million primarily due to a 20.0 million income tax refund; and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by 16.3 million primarily due to revenue growth and the timing of our payments to vendors. 
 Investing activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was 0.9 million compared to 25.6 million used in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased property and equipment for 98.3 million compared to 82.5 million during the same period in the prior year. We believe the ownership or long-term leasing of equipment is generally preferable to renting equipment on a project-by-project basis, as this strategy helps to ensure the equipment is available for our projects when needed. In addition, this approach has historically resulted in lower overall equipment costs. We periodically sell assets, typically to update our fleet. We received proceeds from the sale of assets of 97.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 47.6 million during the same period in the prior year. Financing activities Financing activities used cash of 74.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 60.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to the following: Payments of long-term debt of 55.9 million; Dividend payments to our stockholders of 9.6 million; and Payments related to tax withholding for stock-based compensation of 6.6 million. Financing activities used cash of 60.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to the following: Payment of long-term debt of 66.1 million;

 Dividend payments to our stockholders of 9.6 million; and Net borrowings on our credit facilities of 20.0 million. Credit Agreements For a description of our credit agreements, see Note 7 Credit Arrangements in Item 1, Financial Statements of this Third Quarter 2024 Report. Common stock For a discussion of items affecting our common stock, please see Note 11 Stockholders Equity in Item 1, Financial Statements of this Third Quarter 2024 Report. Off-balance sheet transactions We enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected on our balance sheet. We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangement with VIEs. The following represents transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered material off-balance sheet arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, we had letters of credit outstanding of 53.5 million under the terms of our credit agreements. These letters of credit are used by our insurance carriers to ensure reimbursement for amounts that they are disbursing on our behalf, such as beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance program. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require us to post a letter of credit to ensure payments to our subcontractors or guarantee performance under our contracts. Letters of credit reduce our borrowing availability under our Amended Credit Agreement and our Canadian credit facilities. If these letters of credit were drawn on by the beneficiary, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit, and we may be required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. As of the date of this Third Quarter 2024 Report, we do not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit; In the ordinary course of our business, we may be required by our customers to post surety bid or completion bonds in connection with services that we provide. As of September 30, 2024, we had bid and completion bonds issued and outstanding totaling approximately 7.4 billion. The remaining performance obligation on those bonded projects totaled approximately 2.9 billion as of September 30, 2024. As of the date of this Third Quarter 2024 Report, we do not anticipate that we would have to fund any material claim under our surety arrangements; Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements with unions. In most instances, these agreements require that we contribute to multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans. For many plans, the contributions are determined annually and required future contributions cannot be determined since contribution rates depend on the total number of union employees and actuarial calculations based on the demographics of all participants. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Amendments Act of 1980, subjects employers to potential liabilities in the event of an employer s complete or partial withdrawal of an underfunded multi-employer pension plan. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules for multi-employer plans that are classified as endangered , seriously endangered , or critical . We do not currently anticipate withdrawal from any multi-employer pension plans. Withdrawal liabilities or requirements for increased future contributions could negatively impact our results of operations and liquidity; We enter into employment agreements with certain employees which provide for compensation and benefits under certain circumstances and which may contain a change of control clause. We may be obligated to make payments under the terms of these agreements; and From time to time, we make other guarantees, such as guaranteeing the obligations of our subsidiaries.

 Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices Our operations are affected by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation or other economic factors. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, equipment, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions that allow us to adjust billing rates for certain major contracts annually; by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work; or by entering into back-to-back contracts with suppliers and subcontractors. However, the annual adjustment provided by certain contracts is typically subject to a cap and there can be an extended period of time between the impact of inflation on our costs and when billing rates are adjusted. In some cases, our actual cost increases have exceeded the contractual caps, and therefore negatively impacted our operations. We have been able to renegotiate some of our major contracts to address the increased costs on future work and will continue to address this with our customers going forward. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Ris k In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to risks related to market conditions. These risks primarily include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. We may seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. These instruments have in the past included interest rate swaps and may in the future include foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and hedges against commodity price fluctuations. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term investments, short-term debt, accounts payable and accrued liabilities shown in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value as of September 30, 2024, due to the generally short maturities of these items. Our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan bear interest at a variable rate which exposes us to interest rate risk. From time to time, we may use certain derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 300.0 million of our variable rate debt outstanding was economically hedged. Based on our variable rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, a 1.0 increase or decrease in interest rates would change annual interest expense by approximately 5.4 million. We do not execute transactions or use financial derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We generally enter into transactions with counter-parties that are financial institutions as a means to limit significant exposure with any one party. Item 4. Controls and Procedure s Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures , as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives.
