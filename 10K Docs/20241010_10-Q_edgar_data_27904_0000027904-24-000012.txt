REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
 Delta Air Lines, Inc. 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and consolidated statements of stockholders' equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "condensed consolidated interim financial statements"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 12, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those Consolidated Financial Statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 We recognized approximately billion and billion in passenger revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that had been recorded in our air traffic liability balance at the beginning of those periods. 
 
 Loyalty Travel Awards 
 
 Loyalty travel awards revenue is related to the redemption of mileage credits ("miles") for air travel. Our SkyMiles loyalty program allows customers to earn miles by flying on Delta, Delta Connection and other airlines that participate in the loyalty program. Customers can also earn miles through participating companies, such as credit card, retail, ridesharing, car rental and hotel companies, who purchase miles from us. Our most significant contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total cash sales from marketing agreements related to our loyalty program were billion and billion, respectively, which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations. 
 
 Current Activity of the Loyalty Program. Miles are combined in one homogeneous pool and are not separately identifiable. Therefore, revenue is comprised of miles that were part of the loyalty program deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period as well as miles that were issued during the period. The timing of mile redemptions can vary widely; however, the majority of miles have historically been redeemed within of being earned.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately billion undrawn and available under our revolving credit facilities. 
 
 Early Settlement of Outstanding Notes 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, through early principal repayments and open market repurchases, we extinguished an aggregate principal amount of million related to a portion of the SkyMiles Term Loan and various secured and unsecured notes. These payments resulted in a million loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in non-operating expense in our income statement. 
 
 Corporate Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 In July 2024, Fitch upgraded Delta's credit rating to BBB-, an investment grade metric, which satisfied the collateral release conditions under the Corporate Revolving Credit Facility. As a result, the liens on collateral, including our Pacific route authorities and certain related other assets, were released in the September 2024 quarter. Additionally, the minimum collateral coverage ratio and minimum liquidity covenants were replaced by minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum asset coverage ratio covenants.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 September 2024 Quarter Financial Highlights 
 
 Our operating income for the September 2024 quarter was 1.4 billion, a decrease of 587 million compared to the September 2023 quarter. 
 
 Revenue. Compared to the September 2023 quarter, our total revenue increased 189 million, or 1 , due to increased revenue related to refinery sales to third parties and a 4 increase in capacity. Passenger revenue was comparable to the September 2023 quarter on an increase in revenue for premium products and loyalty travel awards, offset by a decrease in main cabin ticket revenue. Total revenue, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes revenue related to refinery sales to third parties) increased in the September 2024 quarter by 41 million compared to the September 2023 quarter. 
 
 In July 2024, our operations were significantly disrupted by the CrowdStrike-caused outage. We estimate that this disruption led to a direct revenue impact of approximately 380 million related to approximately 7,000 flight cancellations over five days, which reduced our expected year-over-year capacity growth in the quarter by approximately 1.5 percentage points. 
 
 Operating Expense. Total operating expense in the September 2024 quarter increased 776 million, or 6 , compared to the September 2023 quarter, primarily due to costs associated with the 4 increase in capacity, higher employee costs from increased wages, increased landing fees and other rents and costs associated with the CrowdStrike-caused outage. The outage and operational recovery resulted in approximately 170 million of additional operating expenses primarily due to customer expense reimbursements and crew-related costs. Fuel expense was approximately 50 million lower than it would have been as a result of the 7,000 flight cancellations over the five-day period. Total operating expense, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure, which primarily excludes expenses related to refinery sales to third parties) in the September 2024 quarter increased 631 million, or 5 , compared to the September 2023 quarter. 
 
 Our total operating cost per available seat mile ("CASM") increased 2 compared to the September 2023 quarter, primarily for the same reasons as the increase in total operating expense. Non-fuel unit cost ("CASM-Ex", a non-GAAP financial measure) increased 5.7 . 
 
 Cash Flow . Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate undrawn principal amount available under our revolving credit facilities ("liquidity") as of September 30, 2024 was 6.9 billion. 
 
 During the September 2024 quarter, operating activities generated 1.3 billion, primarily from ticket sales. Total cash sales to American Express were 1.8 billion in the September 2024 quarter, an increase of approximately 6 compared to the September 2023 quarter. 
 
 Cash flows used in investing activities during the quarter totaled 1.1 billion primarily from capital expenditures. These operating and investing activities yielded free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) of 95 million in the September 2024 quarter. Additionally, we had cash outflows of 263 million related to repayments of our debt and finance leases. 
 
 The non-GAAP financial measures referenced above for total revenue, adjusted, operating expense, adjusted, CASM-Ex and free cash flow are defined and reconciled in "Supplemental Information" below.

 Domestic 
 
 Domestic passenger revenue was consistent between the September 2024 quarter and the September 2023 quarter on a 3 increase in capacity and a slight decrease in load factor. We experienced strong revenue results across the domestic network, with premium revenue growing more than main cabin revenue compared to the prior year period. 
 
 International 
 
 International passenger revenue for the September 2024 quarter was consistent with the September 2023 quarter. The Atlantic region benefited from improved demand for travel to Paris following the summer Olympics. Our Latin America revenue reflects the continued maturation of our joint venture with LATAM in South America, while network restoration continues in the Pacific, with double-digit revenue growth driven by travel to South Korea and Japan.

 Refinery. Refinery sales to third parties increased 148 million compared to the September 2023 quarter. See "Refinery Segment" below for additional details on the refinery's operations, including third party refinery sales. 
 
 Loyalty Program. This relates to revenues from brand usage by third parties and other performance obligations embedded in miles sold, as well as redemption of miles for non-air travel and other awards. These revenues are mainly driven by customer spend on American Express cards and new cardholder acquisitions. Revenues from our relationship with American Express increased compared to the September 2023 quarter due to increased co-brand card spend and card account acquisitions. 
 
 Ancillary Businesses. This includes revenues from aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations. The decrease in revenues compared to the September 2023 quarter was driven by lower aircraft maintenance services revenue during the September 2024 quarter. 
 
 Miscellaneous. This is primarily composed of revenues related to lounge access, including access provided to certain American Express cardholders, codeshare agreements and certain other commercial relationships. The increase in revenues compared to the September 2023 quarter was primarily driven by codeshare agreements and other commercial relationships.

 Salaries and Related Costs. The increase in salaries and related costs primarily resulted from the implementation of base pay increases for eligible employees of 5 effective June 1, 2024 and for Delta pilots on January 1, 2024. In June 2024 we also increased our minimum starting wage for domestic mainline employees to 19 per hour. Salaries and related costs also increased due to additional crew-related costs resulting from the CrowdStrike-caused outage. 
 
 Aircraft Fuel and Related Taxes. Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased 189 million compared to the September 2023 quarter primarily due to a 13 decrease in the market price of jet fuel offset by a 3 increase in consumption on a 4 increase in capacity. Fuel expense was also approximately 50 million lower than it would have been as a result of the 7,000 flight cancellations over the five-day period following the CrowdStrike-caused outage. We continue to expect that fuel consumption for the remainder of 2024 will increase compared to 2023 aligned with capacity, partially offset by increases in the fuel efficiency of our fleet. The refinery generated an operating loss resulting in incremental cost of three cents per gallon compared to a benefit of 11 cents per gallon in the September 2023 quarter. We expect jet fuel prices to remain volatile throughout the remainder of 2024 and into 2025.

Refinery sales to third parties increased 148 million compared to the September 2023 quarter. See "Refinery Segment" below for additional details on the refinery's operations, including third party refinery sales. 
 
 Landing Fees and Other Rents. The increase in landing fees and other rents primarily resulted from higher rates charged by airports following extensive redevelopment projects at numerous facilities and more flights compared to the September 2023 quarter that contributed to our increased capacity.

 Profit Sharing. Profit sharing decreased by 97 million compared to the September 2023 quarter due to lower projected profit for the year. Our profit sharing program pays 10 to all eligible employees for the first 2.5 billion of annual profit, as defined by the terms of the program, and 20 of annual profit above 2.5 billion. 
 
 Other. The increase in other is primarily due to the impact of service recovery costs including customer expense reimbursements from the CrowdStrike-caused outage and higher volume-related expenses associated with increased capacity, such as flight crew and other employee travel and incidental costs.

 Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net includes interest expense and interest income. This decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced interest expense resulting from our debt reduction initiatives. During 2023, we made payments of approximately 4.1 billion related to our debt and finance lease obligations. We have continued to pay down our debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with 2.4 billion of payments on debt and finance lease obligations, including approximately 900 million of early repayments. This included early extinguishment of 744 million in principal related to a portion of the SkyMiles Term Loan and various secured and unsecured notes, and approximately 150 million on finance leases that were scheduled to be paid later in 2024. We continue to seek opportunities to pre-pay our debt, in addition to periodic amortization and scheduled maturities. 
 
 Gain/(loss) on investments, net. Changes in the valuation of investments accounted for at fair value are recorded in gain/(loss) on investments, net and are driven by changes in stock prices, foreign currency fluctuations and other valuation techniques for investments in certain companies, particularly those without publicly-traded shares. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our equity investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt reflects the losses incurred in the early repayment of certain loans and notes. 
 
 Miscellaneous, net. Miscellaneous, net primarily includes employee benefit plans net periodic cost, charitable contributions, our share of our equity method investments' results and foreign exchange gains/(losses). 

Income Taxes 
 
 We project our annual effective tax rate for 2024 will be between 24 and 26 . In certain periods, we may have adjustments to our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of changes in prior year estimates, mark-to-market adjustments on our equity investments and tax laws enacted during the period, which will impact the effective tax rate for that period.

Item 2. MD A - Refinery Segment 

 Refinery Segment 
 
 The refinery operated by Monroe primarily produces gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Monroe exchanges non-jet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations. The jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery typically provides approximately 200,000 barrels per day, or approximately 75 of our consumption, for use in our airline operations. The refinery regularly optimizes its sales and exchange activities based on market conditions. The refinery generated lower operating income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to operating income in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of lower pricing.

Item 2. MD A - Financial Condition and Liquidity 

 Financial Condition and Liquidity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 6.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate undrawn principal amount available under our revolving credit facilities. We expect to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. 
 
 Undrawn Lines of Credit. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.9 billion undrawn and available under our revolving credit facilities. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 We generated cash flows from operations of 6.1 billion and 5.9 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to continue generating positive cash flows from operations during the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Our operating cash flow is impacted by the following factors: 
 
 Seasonality of Advance Ticket Sales. We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date. When we receive a cash payment at the time of sale, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability. The air traffic liability typically increases during the winter and spring months as advance ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months. 
 
 Fuel. Fuel expense represented approximately 20 and 21 of our total operating expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations. For example, the market price for jet fuel was 13 lower in the September 2024 quarter compared to the September 2023 quarter after it was 5 higher in the June 2024 quarter compared to the June 2023 quarter. Fuel consumption was higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods due to the increase in capacity. We continue to expect that fuel consumption for the remainder of 2024 will increase compared to 2023 aligned with capacity, partially offset by increases in the fuel efficiency of our fleet. 
 
 Profit Sharing. We paid 1.4 billion in profit sharing payments in February 2024 related to our 2023 pre-tax profit in recognition of our employees' contributions toward achieving the year's financial results. This is an increase compared to our profit sharing payment made in February 2023 of 563 million related to our 2022 pre-tax profit. 
 
 Our broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to eligible employees. In determining the amount of profit sharing, the program defines profit as pre-tax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we accrued 964 million in profit sharing expense based on the year-to-date performance and current expectations for 2024 profit. 
 
 Sale of Miles to Participating Companies. Customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card, retail, ridesharing, car rental and hotel companies with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles. Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period. Our most significant contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. Total cash sales to American Express were 5.4 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6 compared to the prior year period. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the cash sales from marketing agreements.

Item 2. MD A - Financial Condition and Liquidity 

 Investing Activities 
 
 Short-Term Investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we redeemed a net of 1.1 billion in short-term investments. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these investments. 
 
 Capital Expenditures. Our capital expenditures were 3.8 billion and 3.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have committed to future aircraft purchases and have obtained, but are under no obligation to use, long-term financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of the aircraft. Our expected 2024 capital spend of approximately 5.0 billion, excluding the New York-LaGuardia airport project discussed below, will be primarily for aircraft, including deliveries and advance deposit payments, as well as fleet modifications and technology enhancements. 
 
 New York-LaGuardia Redevelopment. As part of the terminal redevelopment project at LaGuardia Airport, we are partnering with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to replace Terminals C and D with a new state-of-the-art terminal facility. Construction is ongoing with completion expected by the end of 2024. 
 
 Using funding primarily provided by existing financing arrangements and other sources of funding, we expect to spend approximately 350 million on this project during 2024, of which 237 million was incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Debt and Finance Leases. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had cash outflows of 2.4 billion related to repayments of our debt and finance lease obligations, including approximately 900 million of early repayments. This included early extinguishment of 744 million in principal related to a portion of the SkyMiles Term Loan and various secured and unsecured notes, and approximately 150 million on finance leases that were scheduled to be paid later in 2024. We continue to seek opportunities to pre-pay our debt, in addition to periodic amortization and scheduled maturities. 
 
 In February 2024, Moody's credit rating agency affirmed our credit rating and upgraded its outlook for Delta to positive. In July 2024, Fitch upgraded Delta's credit rating to BBB-, an investment-grade metric. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the effect of these ratings changes on our debt agreements. 
 
 Capital Return to Shareholders. On August 20, 2024, we paid the dividend previously declared in the June 2024 quarter for total cash dividends of 96 million. Total cash dividends for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 225 million. 
 
 On September 19, 2024, the Board of Directors approved and we will pay a quarterly dividend of 0.15 per share on October 31, 2024 to shareholders of record as of October 10, 2024. 
 
 Covenants. We were in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements at September 30, 2024.

Item 2. MD A - Supplemental Information 

 Supplemental Information 
 
 We sometimes use information (non-GAAP financial measures) that is derived from the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. 
 
 Included below are reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used within this Form 10-Q to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations below may not calculate exactly due to rounding. These reconciliations include certain adjustments to GAAP measures to provide comparability between the reported periods, if applicable, and for the reasons indicated below: 
 
 Third-party refinery sales. Refinery sales to third parties, and related expenses, are not related to our airline segment. Excluding these sales therefore provides a more meaningful comparison of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry. 
 
 MTM adjustments and settlements on hedges. Mark-to-market ("MTM") adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period, and therefore we remove this impact to allow investors to better understand and analyze our core performance. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the applicable period. 
 
 Aircraft fuel and related taxes. The volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance. The adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and year-over-year financial performance. 
 
 Profit sharing. We adjust for profit sharing because this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry. 
 
 One-time pilot agreement expenses . In the March 2023 quarter, Delta pilots ratified a new four-year Pilot Working Agreement effective January 1, 2023. The agreement included a provision for a one-time payment made upon ratification in the March 2023 quarter of 735 million. Additionally, we recorded adjustments to other benefit-related items of approximately 130 million. Adjusting for these expenses allows investors to better understand and analyze our core cost performance.

 Free Cash Flow 
 
 The following table shows a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating and used in investing activities (GAAP measures) to free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure). We present free cash flow because management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for use for debt service or general corporate initiatives. Adjustments include: 
 
 Net redemptions of short-term investments. Net redemptions of short-term investments represent the net purchase and sale activity of investments and marketable securities in the period, including gains and losses. We adjust for this activity to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow generated by our operations. 
 
 Net cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and other. Cash flows related to certain airport construction projects are included in our GAAP operating activities and capital expenditures. We have adjusted for these items because management believes investors should be informed that a portion of these capital expenditures from airport construction projects are either reimbursed by a third party or funded with restricted cash specific to these projects.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" of our Form 10-K includes a discussion of our legal proceedings. There have been no material changes from the legal proceedings described in our Form 10-K. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Form 10-K includes a discussion of our known material risk factors, other than risks that could apply to any issuer or offering. The information presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in our Form 10-K. Except as presented below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors described in our Form 10-K. 
 
 Disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Disruptions in our information technology capability could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems, whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third-party locations, or large-scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend, such as power, telecommunications or the internet. The operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. A significant individual, sustained or repeated failure of our information technology infrastructure, including third-party networks, software-as-a-service applications, cloud services, or technology that we utilize and on which we depend, could impact our operations and our customer service, result in loss of revenue, increased costs and damage our reputation. While we have initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to prevent or mitigate disruptions, we recently experienced a global outage caused by a faulty update by cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike in July 2024 that resulted in global information technology outages of Windows-based systems. The faulty software update significantly affected our information technology systems, disrupting our operations. The operational disruption resulted in flight delays and approximately 7,000 cancellations of Delta flights over five days, impacting 1.4 million customers. The CrowdStrike-caused outage and resulting operational disruption adversely impacted our results of operations as discussed in more detail in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis. While we continue to invest in improvements to our preventative initiatives and disaster recovery plans, the measures we have in place may not be adequate to prevent future business disruptions and any material adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business. 
 
 Delta Air Lines, Inc. | September 2024 Form 10-Q

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

 Failure of the technology we use to perform effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We are dependent on technology initiatives and capabilities to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, substantially all of our tickets are issued to our customers as electronic tickets, and a growing number of our customers check in using our website, airport kiosks and our FlyDelta mobile application. We have made and continue to make significant investments in customer facing technology such as delta.com, the FlyDelta mobile application, in-flight wireless internet, check-in kiosks, customer service applications, application of biometric technology, airport information displays and related initiatives, including security for these initiatives. We are also investing in significant upgrades to technology infrastructure and other supporting systems and transitioning to cloud-based technologies. The performance, reliability and security of the technology we use are critical to our ability to serve customers. If this technology does not perform effectively, including as a result of the implementation or integration of new or upgraded technologies or systems, our business and operations can be negatively affected, which could be material. As discussed above, the faulty CrowdStrike software update that resulted in global information technology outages of Windows-based systems in July 2024 significantly affected our information technology systems, disrupting our operations. The operational disruption resulted in flight delays and approximately 7,000 cancellations of Delta flights over five days, impacting 1.4 million customers. Additional failures of the technology we use or depend on could expose us to liability, disrupt our business and damage our reputation in the future. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
