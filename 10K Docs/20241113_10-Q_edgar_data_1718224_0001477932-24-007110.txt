CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS Forward-Looking Information This quarterly report contains, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about the business, financial condition and prospects of BT Brands, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (together, the Company ). Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as believes, projects, expects, may, estimates, likely, should, plans, targets, intends, could, would, anticipates, potential, confident, optimistic or the negative thereof, or other variations thereon, or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy, objectives, estimates, guidance, expectations, and future plans. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results in future periods. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. While the Company believes the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurances that such expectations will prove to be accurate. Security holders are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this report in the context of the factors that could cause outcomes to differ materially from our expectations. These factors include, but are not limited to: capital requirements and the availability of capital to fund our growth; difficulties executing our growth strategy, including completing profitable acquisitions; the impact of public health matters; all risks of acquiring an existing restaurant business, including identifying a suitable target, completing comprehensive due diligence, the impact on our financial condition of any debt we may incur in acquiring the target, the ability to integrate the target s operations with our existing operations, our ability to retain management and key employees of the target, among other factors relevant to acquisitions; challenges related to hiring and retaining store employees at competitive wage rates; our failure to prevent food safety and foodborne illness incidents; shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of food products; our dependence on a small number of suppliers and a single distribution company; negative publicity relating to any one of our restaurants; competition from other restaurant chains with significantly greater resources than we have; changes in economic conditions, including the effects on consumer confidence and discretionary spending; changes in consumer tastes and nutritional and dietary trends; our inability to manage our growth; loss of key personnel; labor shortages and increased labor costs; our vulnerability to increased food, commodity, and energy costs; the impact of governmental laws and regulations; failure to obtain and maintain required licenses and permits to comply with food control regulations; changes in economic conditions, adverse weather, and other unforeseen conditions; inadequately protecting our intellectual property; breaches of security of confidential consumer information; and other factors discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K under Business and Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Page 2 of 26 We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, will result in the consequences we anticipate or affect us or our operations in the ways we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates regarding those or other forward-looking statements. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements are also included in our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, our Schedule 14A, our press releases and other materials released to the public. Although we believe that at the time made, the expectations reflected in all of these forward-looking statements are and will be reasonable, any or all of the forward-looking statements may prove to be incorrect. This may occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, certain of which are beyond our control, will be important in determining our future performance. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated from forward-looking statements. In light of these and other uncertainties, you should not regard the inclusion of a forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or other public communications that we might make as a representation that our plans and objectives will be achieved, and you should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

Therefore, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These differences can arise as a result of the risks described in the section entitled Item 1A.

Introduction As of September 29, 2024, including our partially owned Bagger Dave s business, we owned and operated eighteen restaurants comprising the following: Eight Burger Time fast-food restaurants BTND Village Bier Garten is a German-themed restaurant, bar, and entertainment venue in Cocoa, Florida. VBG ): Keegan s Seafood Grille in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida Keegan s Pie In The Sky Coffee and Bakery in Woods Hole, Massachusetts PIE ). Schnitzel Haus in Hobe Sound, Florida Schnitzel ). Unconsolidated affiliate, Bagger Dave s Burger Tavern, Inc., 40 owned, operates six Bagger Dave s restaurants in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana BD ). Our business environment is challenging, as competition is intense. We operate through a central management organization that provides continuity across our restaurant base by utilizing the efficiencies of a central management team. Notable Recent Events Our recent acquisitions have allowed us to diversify our operations into new restaurant segments and new geographic regions, reducing our dependency on the financial performance of our Burger Time restaurants. During 2022, we acquired three operating restaurants and approximately a 40 ownership interest in Bagger Dave s, an operator of six casual restaurants. During the second quarter of 2024, we acquired assets and assumed the remaining lease obligation related to the Schnitzel Haus restaurant in Hobe Sound, Florida. We continue to consider new acquisition opportunities. Material Trends and Uncertainties Industry trends have a direct impact on our business. Current trends include difficulties attracting food service workers and rapid inflation in the cost of input items. Recent trends also include the rapidly changing area of technology and food delivery. The major companies in the restaurant industry have rapidly adopted and developed smartphone and mobile delivery applications, aggressively expanded drive-through operations, and developed loyalty programs and database marketing supported by a robust technology platform. We expect these trends to continue as restaurants aggressively compete for customers. Competitors will continue to discount prices through aggressive promotions. Food costs have increased over the last two years, and we expect to see moderation of inflationary pressure during the remainder of 2024. Beef and egg costs trended down slightly in 2023. Given the competitive nature of the restaurant industry, raising menu prices to fully cover cost increases may be challenging. As a result, future margin improvements may take time to achieve. Margin improvement will be achieved through operational enhancements, equipment advances, and increased volumes offsetting food cost increases. Labor is a critical factor in operating our stores. Securing staff to run our locations at full capacity has become more challenging in most areas where we operate our restaurants. The current labor market has resulted in higher wages as the competition for employees intensifies, not only in the restaurant industry but in practically all retail and service industries. To succeed, we must identify, develop, and retain quality employees.

The increase in sales was principally the result of improved sales performance at Burger Time. The increase reflects strong sales performance at Pie in the Sky, which experienced an approximately 12 sales increase over the prior year s 13-week period. The increase also reflects sales increases at the majority of our Burger Time locations. Sales also reflect the addition of the operations of Schnitzel Haus on May 13, 2024, during a seasonally slower period. Restaurant unit sales for Burger Time for the 13 weeks ranged from a low of approximately 151,000 to a high of approximately 316,000. Average sales for each Burger Time unit were approximately 251,000 in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 25,000 from 226,000 in the same 13-week period in 2023. Due to our Ham Lake location only opening in July of this quarter, its sales were not included in these calculations. The average customer transaction at our Burger Time restaurants increased by approximately 10 in 2024. The results reflect a significant menu price increase, particularly in our Deal of the Day offering. The average check is currently about 18.00. Our various restaurants all experience unique seasonal sales patterns. Costs of Sales - food and paper: The cost of sales food and paper the fiscal 2024 period decreased from 36.2 to 35.9 of restaurant sales when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This percentage was the net result of moderating inflationary pressures, including the cost of key inputs from a year ago and the impact of menu price increases at all locations, particularly at Burger Time, where the menu price of the popular Deal of the Day was increased approximately 10 . Page 18 of 26 Table of Contents Restaurant Operating Costs: Restaurant operating costs (which refer to all the costs associated with the operation of our restaurants but do not include general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization) as a percentage of restaurant sales increased slightly to 89.1 of sales in the fiscal quarter of 2024 from 87.5 in the similar period of fiscal 2023. This increase was the result of increases in labor costs, additional occupancy costs, and stabilizing commodity costs and the matters discussed in the "Cost of Sales, - food and paper," "Labor Costs," and "Occupancy and Other Operating Costs" sections below. Labor Costs For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, labor and benefits costs increased as a percentage of restaurant sales to 39.0 from 37.7 in fiscal 2023. The increase in percentage resulted from the continued tightness of labor markets and higher-than-historical costs to train new employees. It continued upward competitive pressure on hourly wage costs. These costs were offset by increasing menu prices over the prior year and leveraging existing staffing and labor costs associated with the Schnitzel Haus acquisition. Payroll costs are semi-variable, meaning they do not increase proportionally to increases in revenue. Occupancy and Other Operating Expenses For the third fiscal quarter of 2024, occupancy and other expenses increased to 14.2 of sales from 13.7 in 2023, partly reflecting a spike in maintenance expenses, inflationary increases in utility costs and the lease expense related to the Schnitzel Haus acquisition. Depreciation and Amortization Expense: For the third fiscal quarter of 2024, depreciation and amortization expenses were 141,527 (3.3 of sales), an increase from 114,774 (2.9 of sales) in the prior year, principally due to depreciation related to the Schnitzel Haus acquisition. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs in the third fiscal quarter of 2024 were 375,451, an increase from the previous year s third quarter of 343,027. These costs were 8.6 of sales consistent with 8.6 , in the previous year. Income from Operations The loss from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 75,011, compared to a profit of 40,615 in the prior year s fiscal quarter. This reflects higher hourly pay rates and increases in manager wages in virtually all of the Company s businesses, as well as the items discussed in the Net Sales and Restaurant Operating Costs sections above. Restaurant-level EBITDA To supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses restaurant-level EBITDA, which is not a measure defined by GAAP. This non-GAAP operating measure is useful to both management and, we believe, investors because it represents one means of gauging the overall profitability of our recurring and controllable core restaurant operations. This measure is not indicative of our overall results, nor does restaurant-level profit accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders, primarily due to the exclusion of corporate-level expenses. Restaurant-level EBITDA should not be considered a substitute or superior to operating income calculated under GAAP. The reconciliations to operating income set forth below should be carefully evaluated. Page 19 of 26 Table of Contents We define restaurant-level EBITDA as operating income before pre-opening costs if any, general and administrative costs, depreciation and amortization, and impairment charges. General and administrative expenses are excluded as they are generally not specifically identifiable as restaurant-specific costs. Depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges are excluded because they are not ongoing controllable cash expenses and are not related to the health of ongoing operations. 13 weeks ended, September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Revenues 4,348,824 4,007,656 Reconciliation: Income (Loss) from operations (75,011 40,615 Depreciation and amortization 141,527 114,774 General and administrative, corporate-level expenses 375,451 343,027 Restaurant-level EBITDA 441,967 498,416 Restaurant-level EBITDA margin 10.2 12.4 Results of operations for the 39 weeks ending September 29, 2024, compared to the 39 weeks ending October 1, 2023.

The increase in sales was principally the result of improved sales performance at Burger Time, including a full quarter of sales at our Ham Lake location, which opened as Burger Time in July. The average customer transaction at our Burger Time restaurants increased by approximately 10 in 2024, including a significant percentage increase in our pricing for our Deal of the Day offering. The average check is currently about 18.00. This recent increase is principally the result of menu price increases. Burger Time unit sales for the 39 weeks ranged from a low of approximately 437,000 to a high of approximately 925,000. Average sales for each Burger Time unit were approximately 716,000 in 2024, an increase of 95,000 from 620,000 in the same 39-week period in 2023. Due to our Ham Lake location only opening in July, its sales were not included in these calculations. Page 20 of 26 Table of Contents Sales at PIE for the nine months also continued to be strong, increasing approximately 10 over the prior year, above an estimated 8 menu price increase. Keegan s and the Village Bier Garten combined results were flat, with nine-month sales in 2023. The increase in sales is also contributed by our acquisition of Schnitzel Haus in May of this year. Costs of Sales - food and paper: Cost of sales - food and paper for the nine months of fiscal 2024 declined to 37.8 from 39.3 in the 2023 period due to menu price increases, particularly at Burger Time, where menu price increases contributed to improved margins. Restaurant Operating Costs: Restaurant operating costs, which are associated with operations, not including general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization, increased as a percentage of restaurant sales to 92.3 in 2024 from 86.8 in fiscal 2023. This increase was due to the increase in sales activity from new locations and its impact, as further discussed in the "Cost of Sales," "Labor Costs," and "Occupancy and Other Operating Costs" sections below. Labor Costs: For the nine months of fiscal 2024, labor and benefits costs increased to 39.8 of restaurant sales from 37.2 in fiscal 2023. Shortages in staffing levels combined with higher hourly wage rates at all locations increased the overall labor percentage. Additional management labor at the Company s PIE business. Overall, hiring markets have continued to be challenging in terms of filling open positions. Payroll costs are semi-variable, with most locations requiring minimal staffing levels, and generally, labor costs do not change directly with changes in revenue. Occupancy and Other Operating Expenses: For the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024, occupancy and other expenses increased to 14.7 of sales from 13.1 in 2023, partly due to higher repair and maintenance costs. The increase in 2024 from occupancy expense in 2023 also reflects the 2023 second-quarter reversal of previously accrued property taxes related to a property in the St. Louis, Missouri, area. The St. Louis property was deeded to the taxing area to settle the amount due. Depreciation and Amortization Expense: Depreciation and amortization expenses in the 39-week period of fiscal 2024 increased by 2,619 to 473,420 (4.1 of sales) from 470,801 (4.2 of sales) in the 39-week period of fiscal 2023. This increase is due to the purchase of a new restaurant, capital additions at several of our locations, and the Schnitzel Haus asset purchase. General and Administrative Costs: General and administrative costs in the 39 weeks of 2024 decreased 3,148 to 1,284,871 (11.1 of sales) from 1,288,019 (11.6 of sales) in the same 39-week period of fiscal 2023. The increase is not significant. Income from Operations: The operating loss was 894,383 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to a loss of 289,691 in the same 39 weeks of fiscal 2023. The 2023 operating loss is net of a 313,688 gain on the sale of one of the Company s properties and the resolution of the St. Louis property tax accrual. The change in loss from operations in the nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was due primarily to the increase in labor and occupancy costs, including the "Net Sales" and "Restaurant Operating Costs" sections above. Restaurant-level EBITDA : To supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use restaurant-level EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), which is not a measure defined by GAAP. This non-GAAP operating measure is useful to both management and investors because it represents one means of gauging the overall profitability of our recurring and controllable core restaurant operations. However, this measure is not indicative of our overall results, nor does the restaurant-level profit accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders, primarily due to the exclusion of corporate-level expenses. Accordingly, restaurant-level EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for or superior to operating income, which is calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the reconciliations to operating income set forth below should be carefully evaluated. Page 21 of 26 Table of Contents We define restaurant-level EBITDA as operating income before pre-opening costs if any, general and administrative costs, depreciation, and amortization. General and administrative expenses are excluded as they are generally unrelated to restaurant-specific costs. Depreciation and amortization are excluded because they are not ongoing controllable cash expenses and are unrelated to ongoing operations health. 39 Weeks Ended, September 29, 2024 October 2, 2023 Revenues 11,649,610 11,078,419 Reconciliation: Income (loss) from operations (894,383 (289,691 Gain on sale of assets - (313,688 Depreciation and amortization 473,420 470,801 General and administrative, corporate-level expenses 1,284,871 1,288,019 Restaurant-level EBITDA 863,908 1,155,441 Restaurant-level EBITDA margin 7.4 10.4 Liquidity and Capital Resources On September 29, 2024, we had 5.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and net working capital of 4.3 million, a decrease of 1.4 million from December 31, 2023. On June 6, 2024, the Company authorized a stock repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to 625,000 shares, or approximately 10.0 , of the Company's currently issued and outstanding common stock (the 2024 Share Repurchase Program ). We have not established any maximum aggregate price to be paid for shares that we repurchase. We are purchasing the shares with cash generated from operations. We do not believe that the cash we expend for share repurchases will materially impact our liquidity. Our primary requirements for liquidity are to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and general corporate needs, as well as to invest in or acquire businesses. Our operations do not require significant working capital, and, like many restaurant companies, we generally operate with negative working capital. We anticipate that working capital deficits may be incurred in the future and possibly increase. Our primary liquidity and cash flow sources are operating cash flows and cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand. We use this to service debt, maintain our stores to operate efficiently and increase our working capital. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we collect cash from sales from our customers at the point of purchase or within a few days from our credit card processor; generally, payments to our vendors are not due for thirty days. Summary of Cash Flows Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities Operating cash flow for the thirty-nine weeks ending September 29, 2024, was a negative 197,102. This was impacted by ongoing seasonal trading patterns in our business, which experienced increased labor costs and repair and maintenance expenses. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities We have continued to make improvements in our existing businesses and to seek acquisitions in the food service and related industries in addition to investing funds in marketable securities. Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities A significant portion of our cash flow used in financing activities is allocated to service our debt and to share repurchases. Contractual Obligations As of September 29, 2024, we had 4.2 million in contractual obligations relating to amounts due under mortgages on the real property where our stores are situated, including 1.8 million in capitalized lease obligations related to our recent acquisitions. Our monthly required payments on lease and mortgage obligations are approximately 47,000. Page 22 of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK. As a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we have elected to comply with certain scaled disclosure reporting obligations and are not required to provide the information required by this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Disclosure Controls and Procedures (1) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of September 29, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation and the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 29, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules, regulations, and forms of the SEC, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated by and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. (2) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In addition to the matters discussed previously, the Company identified a consultant as an extension of management to potentially assist in the accounting for acquisitions. Except for the items described above, there were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter, which ended September 29, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Page 23 of 26 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS There are no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or as to which any of its property is subject, and no such proceedings are known to be threatened or contemplated against it. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Share Repurchase Program On June 6, 2024, the Company authorized a stock repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to 625,000 shares, or approximately 10.0 , of the Company's currently issued and outstanding common stock (the 2024 Share Repurchase Program ). We have not established any maximum aggregate price to be paid for shares that we repurchase. As of September 29, 2024, we had repurchased an aggregate of 289,181 shares under the repurchase program, representing approximately 4.6 of our outstanding common stock as of the date the program was authorized by the board of directors, for an aggregate price of 470,843. We may purchase up to an additional 335,819 shares of our outstanding shares of common stock under the program. We are purchasing the shares with available cash. Under the share repurchase program, the Company may have repurchased its common stock from time to time, in amounts, at prices, and at such times as the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations. The Company s repurchases may have been executed using open market purchases, unsolicited or solicited privately negotiated transactions or other transactions. The share repurchase program did not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended, modified or terminated at any time without prior notice. The share repurchase program does not contain a time limitation during which repurchases are permitted to occur. The table below sets forth information with respect to shares repurchased during the quarter ended September 29, 2024.Period Total Number of Shares Purchase Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet be Purchased under the Program 1 July 1 July 31, 2024 13,328 1.55 460,424 255,000 August 1 August 31 2024 3,075 1.54 463,499 250,000 September 1 September 29, 2024 7,342 1.70 470,841 260,000 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities On February 9, 2022, the independent members of the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a grant of 250,000 shares of common stock to each of Gary Copperud and Kenneth Brimmer, the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively, if, so long as the Company's publicly traded warrants are outstanding, the Company's common stock trades at 8.50 per share for 20 consecutive trading days. The award of the shares is tied directly to the price at which the common stock purchase warrants issued in the Company's initial public offering completed in November 2021 are redeemable by the Company. The warrants initially are exercisable at 5.50 per share (subject to adjustment under certain circumstances). The Company expects that if and when the warrants become redeemable, holders will exercise their warrants, and the Company will receive additional capital to fund acquisitions and growth. On July 5, 2023, the Company granted a seven-year option to purchase 100,000 shares of its common stock at 2.50 per share to a consultant. These options granted to the consultant vest monthly over a 60-month period so long as the consulting relationship continues. On April 1, 2024, the Company granted the three independent members of the Board of Directors options to purchase an aggregate of 15,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 1.61 per share. Under these awards, options to purchase 20 of the total granted vested on the grant date and the balance of the options vest in equal annual installments on the anniversary of the grant date in each of the four ensuing years. Other than as set forth above, since the date on which the Company filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K and through the date of this quarterly report, we did not sell any securities. ITEM 3.
