 billion and billion for such legal actions in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities. In many matters, it is inherently difficult to determine whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the potential loss. Some matters may involve compensatory, punitive or other treble damage claims, environmental remediation programs or sanctions that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that cannot be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, while we believe that appropriate accruals have been established for losses that are probable and can be reasonably estimated, it is possible that adverse outcomes from such proceedings could exceed the amounts accrued by an amount that could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period. 
 
 GM Korea Subcontract Workers Litigation GM Korea Company (GM Korea) is party to litigation with current and former subcontract workers over allegations that they are entitled to the same wages and benefits provided to full-time employees, and to be hired as full-time employees. In May 2018 and September 2020, the Korean labor authorities issued adverse administrative orders finding that GM Korea must hire certain current subcontract workers as full-time employees. GM Korea appealed the May 2018 and September 2020 orders. Since June 2020, the Seoul High Court (an intermediate-level appellate court) ruled against GM Korea in subcontract worker claims. While GM Korea's appeals were pending in the Supreme Court of the Republic of Korea (Korea Supreme Court), GM Korea hired certain of its subcontract workers as full-time employees. During the third quarter of 2024, the Korea Supreme Court issued its decisions with respect to the appeal. While the Korea Supreme Court ruled against GM Korea on most of the appeals, the Korea Supreme Court ruled in favor of GM Korea with regard to certain subcontract workers. At September 30, 2024, our accrual covering certain asserted claims and claims that we believe are probable of assertion and for which liability is probable was approximately million. We estimate the

 putative class actions pending in the U.S. were dismissed with prejudice and judgment entered in favor of GM. In August 2024, the Sixth Circuit reversed the dismissal in one of the cases, and we are seeking a rehearing of that decision. The Sixth Circuit has not yet decided plaintiffs' appeal of the other case. We are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions. GM has also faced a series of additional lawsuits in the U.S. based on these allegations, including a shareholder demand lawsuit that remains pending. 
 
 There are several putative class actions and certified class actions pending against GM in the U.S. alleging that various 2011 2014 model year vehicles are defective because they excessively consume oil. While many of these proceedings have been dismissed or have been settled for insignificant amounts, several remain outstanding. In October 2022, we received an adverse jury verdict in a certified class action proceeding involving three states. We do not believe that the verdict is supported by the evidence and plan to appeal. We are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that may result from the putative class action proceedings and have previously accrued an immaterial amount related to one of the certified class action proceedings. 
 
 There is putative class action and certified class action pending against GM in the U.S. alleging that various 2015 2022 model year vehicles are defective because they are equipped with faulty 8-speed transmissions. In March 2023, the judge overseeing the class action concerning 2015 2019 model year vehicles certified 26 state subclasses. In August 2024, the Sixth Circuit affirmed this class certification order. We are seeking a rehearing of the Sixth Circuit's ruling. The putative class action concerning 2020 2022 model year vehicles is pending in front of a different judge that has not yet addressed class certification. We have similar cases pending in Canada concerning these vehicles. We are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible or probable material loss or range of loss that may result from these proceedings in excess of amounts accrued. 
 
 There is a class action pending against GM in the U.S., and a putative class action in Canada, alleging that 2011 2016 model year Duramax Diesel Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra vehicles are equipped with defective fuel pumps that are prone to failure. In March 2023, the U.S. court certified seven state subclasses. We reached an agreement to settle this matter on terms consistent with our accrual and the settlement agreement is pending final court approval. 
 
 Beyond the class action litigations disclosed, we have several other class action litigations pending at any given time. Historically, relatively few classes have been certified in these types of cases. Therefore, we will generally only disclose specific class actions if a class is certified and we believe there is a reasonably possible material exposure to the Company. 
 
 Indirect tax-related matters are being evaluated globally pertaining to value added taxes, customs, duties, sales tax, property taxes and other non-income tax exposures. Certain administrative proceedings are indirect tax-related and may require that we deposit funds in escrow or provide an alternative form of security. For indirect tax-related matters, we estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be up to approximately billion at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Takata Matters In November 2020, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) directed that we replace the Takata Corporation (Takata) airbag inflators in our GMT900 vehicles, which are full-size pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and we decided not to contest NHTSA's decision. While we have already begun the process of executing the

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

 billion for the expected costs of complying with the recall remedy. At September 30, 2024, our remaining accrual for these matters was million, and we believe the currently accrued amount remains reasonable. 
 
 GM has recalled certain vehicles sold outside of the U.S. to replace Takata inflators in those vehicles. There are significant differences in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicles sold internationally and those sold in the U.S. We continue to gather and analyze evidence about these inflators and to share our findings with regulators. Any additional recalls relating to these inflators could be material to our results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 There are several putative class actions that have been filed against GM, including in the U.S. and Canada, arising out of allegations that airbag inflators manufactured by Takata are defective. In March 2023, a U.S. court overseeing one of the putative class actions issued a final judgment in favor of GM on all claims in eight states at issue in that proceeding. In August 2023, the U.S. court granted class certification as to a Louisiana claim, but denied certification as to seven other states. At this stage of these proceedings, we are unable to provide an estimate of the amounts or range of reasonably possible material loss. 
 
 ARC Matters In May 2023, we initiated a voluntary recall covering nearly million 2014 2017 model year Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia SUVs equipped with driver front airbag inflators manufactured by ARC Automotive, Inc. (ARC), and accrued an insignificant amount for the expected costs of the recall. As part of its ongoing investigation into ARC airbag inflators, on September 5, 2023, NHTSA issued an Initial Decision that approximately million frontal driver and passenger airbag inflators manufactured by ARC and Delphi Automotive Systems LLC over a roughly period contain a safety-related defect and must be recalled. On July 31, 2024, NHTSA issued a Supplemental Initial Decision reaffirming its September 2023 Initial Decision and reopening the administrative record to additional public comments. The Initial Decision and the Supplemental Initial Decision are primarily based on the occurrence of seven field ruptures involving ARC-manufactured frontal airbag inflators. We are continuing to investigate the cause of the ruptures in GM vehicles in connection with our existing recalls. The administrative record for NHTSA s investigation closed on October 11, 2024, and we are waiting for NHTSA to issue its final decision. As indicated in GM's filed comments in the record, we do not believe that further GM vehicle recalls are necessary or appropriate at this time. However, depending on the outcome of the dispute between NHTSA and ARC, and the possibility of additional recalls, the cost of which may not be fully recoverable, it is reasonably possible that the costs associated with these matters in excess of amounts accrued could be material, but we are unable to provide an estimate of the amounts or range of reasonably possible material loss at this time. 
 
 There are several putative class actions that have been filed against GM, including in the U.S., Canada and Israel, arising out of allegations that airbag inflators manufactured by ARC are defective. At this stage of these proceedings, we are unable to provide an estimate of the amounts or range of reasonably possible material loss. 
 
 Chevrolet Bolt Recall In July 2021, we initiated a voluntary recall for certain 2017 2019 model year Chevrolet Bolt EVs due to the risk that manufacturing defects present in the same battery cell could cause a high voltage battery fire in certain of these vehicles. After further investigation into the manufacturing processes at our battery supplier, LGES, and disassembling battery packs, we determined that the risk of battery cell defects was not confined to the initial recall population. As a result, in August 2021, we expanded the recall to include all 2017 2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt EV and Chevrolet Bolt Electric Utility Vehicles (EUVs). LG Electronics, Inc. and LGES (collectively, LG), have agreed to reimburse GM for certain costs and expenses associated with the recall. The commercial negotiations with LG also resolved other commercial matters associated with our Ultium Cells Holdings LLC joint venture with LGES. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2023, we had accrued a total of billion and recognized receivables totaling billion in connection with these matters. At September 30, 2024, our remaining accrual for these matters was billion. These charges reflect our current best estimate for the cost of the recall remedy, which includes non-traditional recall remedies provided by GM to enhance customer satisfaction. The actual costs of the recall could be materially higher or lower. 
 
 In addition, putative class actions have been filed against GM in the U.S. and Canada alleging that the batteries contained in the Bolt EVs and EUVs included in the recall population are defective. GM has agreed to settle the U.S. class actions for an immaterial amount and the settlement agreement is pending final court approval. 
 
 Opel/Vauxhall Sale In 2017, we sold the Opel and Vauxhall businesses and certain other assets in Europe (the Opel/Vauxhall Business) to PSA Group, now Stellantis N.V. (Stellantis), under a Master Agreement (the Agreement). We also sold the European financing subsidiaries and branches to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. Although the sale reduced our new vehicle presence in Europe, we may still be impacted by actions taken by regulators related to vehicles

 million and million in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, for the expected cost of all known product liability claims, plus an estimate of the expected cost for product liability claims that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self-insured. It is reasonably possible that our accruals for product liability claims may increase in future periods in material amounts, although we cannot estimate a reasonable range of incremental loss based on currently available information. We believe that any judgment against us involving our products for actual damages will be adequately covered by our recorded accruals and, where applicable, excess liability insurance coverage. 
 
 Guarantees We enter into indemnification agreements for liability claims involving products manufactured primarily by certain joint ventures. These guarantees terminate in years ranging from 2025 to 2029, or upon the occurrence of specific events or are ongoing. We believe that the related potential costs incurred are adequately covered by our recorded accruals, which are insignificant. The maximum future undiscounted payments mainly based on royalties received associated with vehicles sold to date were billion and billion for these guarantees at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the majority of which relates to the indemnification agreements. 
 
 We provide payment guarantees on commercial loans outstanding with third parties such as dealers. In some instances, certain assets of the party or our payables to the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may offset, to some degree, the amount of any potential future payments. We are also exposed to residual value guarantees associated with certain sales to rental car companies. 
 
 We periodically enter into agreements that incorporate indemnification provisions in the normal course of business. It is not possible to estimate our maximum exposure under these indemnifications or guarantees due to the conditional nature of these obligations. Insignificant amounts have been recorded for such obligations as the majority of them are not probable or estimable

We expect the remaining cash outflows related to these activities of million to be substantially completed by the end of 2025. 
 
 In October 2023, Cruise voluntarily paused all of its driverless, supervised and manual AV operations in the U.S. while it examined its processes, systems and tools. In conjunction with these actions, Cruise recorded charges before noncontrolling interest of million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which included non-cash restructuring charges of million. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed the Cruise Origin and recognized primarily non-cash charges before noncontrolling interest of million. The non-cash restructuring charges are not reflected in the table above. Cumulatively, we have incurred million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring activities. We expect the remaining cash outflows related to these activities of approximately million to be completed by the end of 2025.

 In November 2023, our Board of Directors increased the capacity under the share repurchase program by billion to an aggregate of billion and approved an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program to repurchase an aggregate amount of billion of our common stock. In December 2023, pursuant to the agreements entered into in connection with the ASR (collectively, the ASR Agreements), we advanced billion and received approximately million shares of our common stock with a value of billion, which were immediately retired. In March 2024, upon the first settlement of the transactions contemplated under the ASR Agreements, we received approximately million additional shares, which were immediately retired. The final number of shares ultimately to be purchased will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of the ASR Agreements, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements. Upon final settlement, we may receive additional shares of common stock, or, under certain circumstances, we may be required to deliver shares of common stock or to make a cash payment, at our election. The final settlement of the transactions contemplated under the ASR Agreements in connection with the ASR program is expected to occur in the three months ending December 31, 2024. 
 
 In June 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization to repurchase up to an additional billion of our outstanding common stock.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Basis of Presentation This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Forward-looking statements in this MD A are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD A and Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, dollar amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. 

Overview Our vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. We will adapt to customer preferences while executing our growth-focused strategy to invest in EVs, hybrids, AVs, software-enabled services and other new business opportunities. To support strong margins and cash flow during this transition, we are strengthening our market position in profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, such as trucks and SUVs. We plan to execute our strategy with a steadfast commitment to good corporate citizenship through more sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture. 
 
 Our financial performance continues to be driven by the strength of our vehicle portfolio including high margin full-size pickup trucks and SUVs, strong consumer demand for our products and the execution of our core business strategy. We remain focused on reducing fixed costs and maintaining pricing discipline. We are monitoring industry pricing pressures, changing interest rates, inflation, warranty claims and consumer demand trends. We continue to prioritize driving down costs and building scale in our EV portfolio to improve profitability. Cruise has also resumed certain on-road operations with a focused and more capital efficient operating plan. 
 
 As we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required. These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results. Refer to the Consolidated Results and regional sections of this MD A for additional information. 
 
 We face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in several countries across the globe due to, among other factors, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emission standards, labor disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of these challenges. 

For the year ending December 31, 2024, we expect Net income attributable to stockholders of between 10.4 billion and 11.1 billion, EBI T-adjusted of between 14.0 billion and 15.0 billion, EPS-diluted of between 9.14 and 9.64 and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between 10.00 and 10.50. Refer to the "Non-GAAP Measures" section of this MD A for additional information. 
 
 The following table reconciles expected Net income attributable to stockholders under U.S. GAAP to expected EBIT-adjusted (dollars in billions):

GMNA Industry sales in North America were 14.9 million units in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 1.9 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. U.S. industry sales were 12.0 million units in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 0.3 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 
 
 Our total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 1.9 million units for market share of 16.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.2 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 
 
 We expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2024 on the continued strength of our product portfolio, improved EV margins and ongoing fixed cost reduction efforts, partially offset by pricing moderation with increased incentives. While we expect EV margins to improve in 2024, it is possible that we will continue to recognize losses to adjust inventory to net realizable value. Our outlook is dependent on the resiliency of the U.S. economy, continuing improvement of supply chain availability, EV-related cost reduction and overall economic conditions. 
 
 GMI Industry sales in China were 18.1 million units in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 2.3 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Our total vehicle sales in China were 1.2 million units for market share of 6.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 1.8 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of 0.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven primarily by a decline in wholesale volumes amid intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity from both new market entrants and established competitors offering vehicles at lower prices. This intense price competition and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and new energy vehicles continue to negatively impact the profitability of our operations in China. Additionally, we believe independent, Chinese automakers are expanding market share and prioritizing production volumes over profitability, with the ability to produce vehicles at costs well below foreign automakers, including our Automotive China JVs. These factors are impacting our China JVs ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JVs. As a result, we are working closely with our JV partners to restructure our operations in China and expect an updated business plan in the fourth quarter. We believe a material loss in value may exist on our interests in certain China JVs and the updated business plan will inform us as to whether any loss in value is other than temporary. If we conclude that the loss in value is other than temporary, we would be required to record a material, non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of this year. The carrying amounts of our investments in the Automotive China JVs and GM Financial China JVs subject to the restructuring actions are 4.4 billion and 1.6 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Outside of China, industry sales were 19.0 million units in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.7 million units for market share of 3.6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 
 
 Cruise Cruise Holdings, our majority-owned subsidiary, is pursuing the development and commercialization of AV technology. In April 2024, Cruise AVs returned to public roads for manual driving operations following a voluntary pause that resulted from an October 2023 accident. Subsequently, Cruise has resumed limited driverless testing in Houston, Texas and supervised operations and manual driving in Houston and Dallas, Texas, and Phoenix, Arizona. We expect Cruise to return to driverless commercial AV operations based on safety and other criteria, but we have not yet determined the timing of such return.

We also continue to engage with certain federal and state agencies, including the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the California Public Utilities Commission, NHTSA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC, who have opened investigations or made inquiries to us and Cruise in connection with the October 2023 incident and are actively cooperating with all government regulators and agencies in connection with these matters. In September 2024, Cruise and NHTSA executed a Consent Order, which imposed a 1.5 million fine on Cruise and requires enhanced reporting and engagement with NHTSA for two years (with an optional third year at NHTSA s discretion). GM is neither a party nor a signatory to the agreement. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the risks associated with our AV strategy. 

Vehicle Sales The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy or range and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely. 
 
 We present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and market share. Wholesale vehicle sales data consists of sales to GM's dealers and distributors as well as sales to the U.S. government and excludes vehicles sold by our joint ventures. Wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 27.0 of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands):

 Total vehicle sales data represents: (1) retail sales (i.e., sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or distributors); (2) fleet sales (i.e., sales to large and small businesses, governments and daily rental car companies); and (3) certain vehicles used by dealers in their business. Total vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures, which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for China. While total vehicle sales data does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during a particular period, we believe it is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles. Total vehicle sales data represents management's good faith estimate based on sales reported by our dealers, distributors and joint ventures; commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data; and internal estimates and forecasts when other data is not available.

GM Financial We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. was 39 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 43 in the corresponding period in 2023. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing programs available and competing third-party financing products in the market. GM Financial's prime loan originations as a percentage of total loan originations in North America decreased to 80 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 82 in the corresponding period in 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 46 , retail finance charge income of 40 and commercial finance charge income of 8 . 
 
 GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Gains on terminations of leased vehicles of 0.2 billion and 0.6 billion were included in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gains of 0.2 billion and 0.7 billion in the corresponding periods in 2023 . The following table summarizes the estimated residual value based on GM Financial's most recent estimates and the number of units included in GM Financial Equipment on operating leases, net by vehicle type (units in thousands):

Consolidated Results We review changes in our results of operations under five categories: Volume, Mix, Price, Cost and Other. Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer s Suggested Retail Price and various sales allowances. Cost primarily includes: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. Other primarily includes foreign exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates.

 GM Financial Revenue In the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue increased primarily due to increased finance charge income of 0.3 billion primarily due to an increase in the effective yield resulting from higher average interest rates on new loans and growth in the size of the portfolio. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue increased primarily due to: (1) increased finance charge income of 1.1 billion primarily due to an increase in the effective yield resulting from higher average interest rates on new loans and growth in the size of the portfolio; and (2) increased investment income of 0.1 billion primarily due to an increase in the average investment balance. 
 
 GM Financial EBT-Adjusted In the three months ended September 30, 2024, EBT-adjusted decreased primarily due to: (1) increased interest expense of 0.3 billion primarily due to an increased effective rate of interest on debt, resulting from higher benchmark interest rates on new issuances relative to maturing debt, as well as an increase in average debt outstanding; and (2) increased provision for loan losses of 0.1 billion primarily due to moderating credit performance; partially offset by (3) increased finance charge income of 0.3 billion primarily due to an increase in the effective yield resulting from higher average interest rates on new loans and growth in the size of the portfolio.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EBT-adjusted decreased primarily due to: (1) increased interest expense of 1.1 billion primarily due to an increased effective rate of interest on debt, resulting from higher benchmark interest rates on new issuances relative to maturing debt, as well as an increase in average debt outstanding; and (2) increased provision for loan losses of 0.1 billion primarily due to moderating credit performance and recovery rates; partially offset by (3) increased finance charge income of 1.1 billion primarily due to an increase in the effective yield resulting from higher average interest rates on new loans and growth in the size of the portfolio; and (4) increased investment income of 0.1 billion primarily due to an increase in the average investment balance. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and other liquidity actions currently available to us are sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements. We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. We have substantial cash requirements going forward, which we plan to fund through our total available liquidity, cash flows from operating activities and additional liquidity measures, if determined to be necessary. 
 
 Our known current material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital spending and our investments in our battery cell manufacturing joint ventures of approximately 10.5 billion to 11.5 billion in 2024; (2) payments for engineering and product development activities, including investing in the development and commercialization of AV technology by Cruise; (3) payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls and any other recall-related contingencies; (4) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans; (5) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our Board of Directors; (6) payments to purchase shares of our common stock authorized by our Board of Directors; and (7) payments of emissions-related compliance costs. Our material future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on the three objectives of our capital allocation program: (1) grow our business at an average target return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-adjusted) rate of 20 or greater; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including a target average automotive cash balance of 18.0 billion; and (3) after the first two objectives are met, return available cash to shareholders. Our senior management evaluates our capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our Board of Directors not less than once annually. 
 
 We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. These actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations, as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions and investments with joint venture partners, as well as strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. To support our transition to EVs, we anticipate making investments in suppliers or providing funding towards the execution of strategic, multi-year supply agreements to secure critical materials. In addition, we have entered, and plan to continue to enter, into offtake agreements that generally obligate us to purchase defined quantities of output. These arrangements could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. 
 
 Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K, some of which are outside of our control. 
 
 In November 2023, our Board of Directors increased the capacity under our previously announced share repurchase program by 10.0 billion to an aggregate of 11.4 billion and approved a 10.0 billion ASR program. In December 2023, pursuant to the agreements entered into in connection with the ASR, we advanced 10.0 billion and received approximately 215 million shares of common stock with a value of 6.8 billion, which were immediately retired. In March 2024, upon the first settlement of the transactions contemplated under the ASR Agreements, we received approximately 4 million additional shares, which were immediately retired. The final number of shares ultimately to be purchased will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of the ASR Agreements, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements. Upon final settlement, we may receive additional shares of common stock, or, under certain circumstances, we may be required to deliver shares of common stock or to make a cash payment, at our electio n. The final settlement of the transactions contemplated under the ASR Agreements is expected to occur in the three months ending December 31, 2024. 
 
 In June 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization to repurchase up to an additional 6.0 billion of our outstanding common stock.

 GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in addition to shares received under the ASR program, we purchased approximately 53 million shares of our outstanding common stock for 2.4 billion, including an insignificant amount related to purchases initiated in September 2024 that settled in October 2024. We have 5.0 billion in capacity remaining under our share repurchase program as of September 30, 2024, with no expiration date. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid dividends of 0.4 billion to holders of our common stock. 
 
 Cash flows that occur amongst our Automotive, Cruise and GM Financial operations are eliminated when we consolidate our cash flows. Such eliminations include, among other things, collections by Automotive on wholesale accounts receivables financed by dealers through GM Financial, payments between Automotive and GM Financial for accounts receivables transferred by Automotive to GM Financial, loans to Automotive and Cruise from GM Financial, dividends issued by GM Financial to Automotive, tax payments by GM Financial to Automotive and Automotive cash injections in Cruise. The presentation of Automotive liquidity, Cruise liquidity and GM Financial liquidity presented below includes the impact of cash transactions amongst the sectors that are ultimately eliminated in consolidation. 

Automotive Liquidity Total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and funds available under credit facilities. The amount of available liquidity is subject to seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations. We have not significantly changed the management of our liquidity, including our allocation of available liquidity, our portfolio composition and our investment guidelines since December 31, 2023. Refer to Part II, Item 7. MD A of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 In March 2024, we renewed our 364-day, 2.0 billion revolving credit facility allocated for the exclusive use of GM Financial, which now matures March 27, 2025. Interest rates on obligations under the renewed credit facility are based on Term SOFR. 
 
 In March 2024, we terminated our unsecured 364-day delayed draw term loan credit agreement that permitted the Company to borrow up to 3.0 billion executed in November 2023, resulting in an insignificant loss. 
 
 We use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. Our Automotive borrowing capacity under credit facilities totaled 14.1 billion at September 30, 2024, which consisted of two credit facilities, and 17.1 billion at December 31, 2023, which consisted of three credit facilities. Total Automotive borrowing capacity under our credit facilities does not include our 364-day, 2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use of GM Financial. We did not have any borrowings against our primary facilities, but had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of 0.5 billion and 0.7 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 If available capacity permits, GM Financial continues to have access to our automotive credit facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against any of these facilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of 0.2 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate. We did not have intercompany loans to GM Financial at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Several of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of September 30, 2024 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future. 
 
 GM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of 1.4 billion on its common stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Future dividends from GM Financial will depend on several factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.

 Adjusted Automotive Free Cash Flow We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net automotive cash provided by operating activities under U.S. GAAP was 19.2 billion, capital expenditures were 7.5 billion and adjustments for management actions were 0.5 billion. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net automotive cash provided by operating activities under U.S. GAAP was 16.1 billion, capital expenditures were 7.1 billion and adjustments for management actions related to Buick dealer strategy and employee separation costs were 1.3 billion. 
 
 Status of Credit Ratings We receive ratings from four independent credit rating agencies: DBRS Limited, Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investors Service and Standard Poor's. All four credit rating agencies currently rate our corporate credit at investment grade. As of October 15, 2024, all credit ratings remained unchanged since December 31, 2023. 

Cruise Liquidity Cruise available liquidity of 0.7 billion and 1.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents. In June 2024, Cruise issued to us a convertible note in the amount of 0.9 billion. This note is convertible into certain Cruise equity interests. Cruise available liquidity excludes a multi-year credit agreement with GM Financial whereby Cruise may borrow a remaining aggregate amount of 3.4 billion through 2024 to fund the purchase of AVs from GM. At September 30, 2024, Cruise had total borrowings of 0.4 billion with GM Financial under this credit agreement. This also excludes a multi-year framework agreement with us whereby Cruise can defer payments until June 2028 on up to 0.8 billion of invoices, which are related to engineering and capital spending incurred by us on behalf of Cruise, and an agreement with us whereby Cruise can defer reimbursing us for amounts we paid related to its restructuring actions that commenced in October 2023. Refer to Note 15 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Cruise's restructuring actions. At September 30, 2024, Cruise deferred 1.2 billion under these agreements.

 We expect Cruise will require additional liquidity in order to support the continued development of AV technology. 

Automotive Financing GM Financial Liquidity GM Financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, net proceeds from credit facilities, securitizations, secured and unsecured borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. GM Financial's primary uses of cash are purchases and funding of finance receivables and leased vehicles, repayment or repurchases of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured credit facilities, interest costs, operating expenses, income taxes and dividend payments. GM Financial continues to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize its liquidity position and the mix of its debt between secured and unsecured debt. 
 
 The following table summarizes GM Financial's available liquidity (dollars in billions): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 4.9 5.3 Borrowing capacity on unpledged eligible assets 25.7 21.9 Borrowing capacity on committed unsecured lines of credit 0.7 0.7 Borrowing capacity on revolving credit facility, exclusive to GM Financial 2.0 2.0 Total GM Financial available liquidity 33.3 29.9 
 
 GM Financial structures liquidity to support at least six months of GM Financial's expected net cash flows, including new originations, without access to new debt financing transactions or other capital markets activity. At September 30, 2024, available liquidity exceeded GM Financial's liquidity targets. 
 
 GM Financial did not have any borrowings outstanding against our credit facility designated for their exclusive use or the remainder of our revolving credit facilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Refer to the "Automotive Liquidity" section of this MD A for additional details. 
 
 Credit Facilities In the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, GM Financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and GM Financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. At September 30, 2024, secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled 27.2 billion, 0.7 billion and 2.0 billion with advances outstanding of 1.3 billion, an insignificant amount and 2.0 billion.

 __________ 
 (a) Includes 5.3 billion and 1.0 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily driven by purchases of, and collections on, wholesale finance receivables and 0.3 billion of intercompany loans due from GM in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which are eliminated within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 (b) Includes 1.4 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for dividends to GM which are eliminated within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in finance charge income and a net decrease in cash used by counterparty derivative collateral posting activities, partially offset by an increase in interest paid. 

Critical Accounting Estimates The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. The critical accounting estimates that affect the condensed consolidated financial statements and the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with those described in the MD A in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Non-GAAP Measures We use both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. Our non-GAAP measures include: EBIT-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; EBT-adjusted for our GM Financial segment; EPS-diluted-adjusted; ETR-adjusted; ROIC-adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures. 
 
 These non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our Board of Directors uses certain of these, and other measures, as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors. 
 
 EBIT-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net income attributable to stockholders) EBIT-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment. 
 
 EPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted- 
 43 

Table of Contents 
 GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances. 
 
 ETR-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Effective tax rate) ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict. 
 
 ROIC-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Return on equity) ROIC-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period. 
 
 Adjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes. Refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD A for additional information.

 (a) These adjustments were excluded because they relate to employee separation charges primarily in North America. 
 (b) These adjustments were excluded because they relate to strategic activities to transition certain Buick dealers out of our dealer network as part of Buick s EV strategy. 
 (c) These adjustments were excluded because they relate to the wind down of our manufacturing operations in Colombia and Ecuador. 
 (d) These adjustments were excluded because they relate to the GM headquarters relocation, primarily consisting of accelerated depreciation.

Forward-Looking Statements This report and the other reports filed by us with the SEC from time to time, as well as statements incorporated by reference herein and related comments by our management, may include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements represent our current judgment about possible future events and are often identified by words like aim, anticipate, appears, approximately, believe, continue, could, designed, effect, estimate, evaluate, expect, forecast, goal, initiative, intend, may, objective, outlook, plan, potential, priorities, project, pursue, seek, should, target, when, will, would, or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions. In making these statements, we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future events or financial results, and our actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, which may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports we file with the SEC, include, among others, the following: (1) our ability to deliver new products, services, technologies and customer
