The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allows the transfer of certain tax credits to third parties in exchange for cash. In September 2024, MGE sold transfer eligible tax credits generated in 2023 to a third party for million. MGE elects to account for the transferred tax credits under the scope of ASC 740. The sale of tax credits is presented in the operating activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows consistent with the presentation of cash taxes paid. MGE also plans to sell eligible credits generated in 2024. MGE includes any expected proceeds from the transfer of tax credits in the evaluation of realizability of deferred tax assets related to tax credits and records a valuation allowance for the difference

(a) In August 2024, MGE entered into an agreement to transfer the mortality and investment risk, as well as the administration of, its employer-paid life insurance plan to a third party. MGE accounted for the settlement under the scope of ASC 715. 

As approved by the PSCW, MGE is allowed to defer differences between actual employee benefit plan costs and costs reflected in current rates. The deferred costs may be recovered or refunded in MGE's next rate filing. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, MGE recovered million and million, respectively, of pension and other postretirement costs previously deferred. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, MGE deferred million and million, respectively, of pension and other postretirement costs. These costs have not been reflected in the table above.

 On October 31, 2024, MGE entered into a private placement Note Purchase Agreement in which it committed to issue million of senior unsecured notes due 2039 and million of senior unsecured notes due 2054. Funding is expected to occur on December 4, 2024. The proceeds of the senior notes will be used to assist with capital expenditures and other corporate obligations. The covenants of these senior notes are substantially consistent with MGE's existing senior unsecured notes.

million and million, respectively, in compensation expense related to share-based compensation awards compared to million and million for the comparable periods in 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, cash payments of million and shares were distributed related to awards that were granted in 2021 under the 2021 Incentive Plan and cash-based awards granted in 2019 under the 2006 Performance Unit Plan. In March 2024, MGE granted performance units and restricted stock units under the 2021 Incentive Plan to eligible employees and non-employee directors. MGE recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Awards classified as equity awards are measured based on their grant-date fair value. Awards classified as liability awards are recorded at fair value each reporting period. The performance units can be paid out in either cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and stock and are classified as a liability award. The restricted stock units will be paid out in shares of common stock, and therefore are classified as equity awards.

Actual costs of compliance may be different than the amount recorded due to potential changes in compliance strategies that will be used, as well as other potential changes in cost estimate. b. Legal Matters. 

 MGE is involved in various legal matters that are being defended and handled in the normal course of business. MGE accrues for costs that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. The accrued amount for these matters is not material to the financial statements. MGE does not expect the resolution of these matters to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Several environmental groups filed petitions against the PSCW challenging the fixed customer charge set in MGE's 2022/2023 rate settlement, 2023 electric limited reopener, and 2024/2025 rate order. MGE has intervened in the petitions in cooperation with the PSCW. See Footnote 9.a. for more information regarding this matter.

Sierra Club and Vote Solar have filed petitions with the Dane County Circuit Court seeking review of the PSCW decisions approving MGE's electric and gas 2022/2023 rate settlement, 2023 electric limited reopener, and 2024/2025 rate order. The PSCW is named as the responding party; MGE is not named as a party. The Petitions challenge the amount of customer fixed charge that does not vary with usage. The requested relief is unclear. The revenue requirement approved by the PSCW in the settlement, limited reopener, and 2024/2025 rate order have not been challenged. The PSCW is expected to vigorously defend its approval of the rate case settlement, limited reopener, and the 2024/2025 rate order. MGE has intervened in the proceedings to further defend the PSCW's decision. The Dane County Circuit Court affirmed

in 2024 and 2023. The electric fuel-related costs are subject to an excess revenues test. Excess revenues are defined as revenues in the year in question that provide MGE with a greater return on common equity than authorized by the PSCW in MGE's latest rate order. The recovery of under-collected electric fuel-related costs would be reduced by the amount that exceeds the excess revenue test. These costs are subject to the PSCW's annual review of fuel costs completed in the year following the deferral. (a)

MGE's commodity derivative contracts and FTRs are subject to regulatory deferral. These derivatives are marked to fair value and are offset with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability. Realized gains and losses are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in earnings in the delivery month applicable to the instrument. As a result of the treatment described above, there are no unrealized gains or losses that flow through earnings. Certain counterparties extend MGE a credit limit. If MGE exceeds these limits, the counterparties may require collateral to be posted. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 , counterparties were in a net liability position. Nonperformance of counterparties to the non-exchange traded derivatives could expose MGE to credit loss. However, MGE enters into transactions only with companies that meet or exceed strict credit guidelines, and it monitors these counterparties on an ongoing basis to mitigate nonperformance risk in its portfolio. As of September 30, 2024 , counterparties had defaulted.

Derivatives. Derivatives include exchange-traded derivative contracts, over-the-counter transactions and FTRs. Most exchange-traded derivative contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are therefore classified as Level 1. A small number of exchange-traded derivative contracts are valued using quoted market pricing in markets with insufficient volumes and are therefore considered unobservable and classified as Level 3. Transactions done with an over-the-counter party are on inactive markets and are therefore classified as Level 3. These transactions are valued based on quoted prices from markets with similar exchange-traded transactions. FTRs are priced based upon monthly auction results for identical or similar instruments in a closed market with limited data available and are therefore classified as Level 3.

Item 2. Man agement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 General 
 
 MGE Energy is an investor-owned public utility holding company operating through subsidiaries in five business segments: 
 
 Regulated electric utility operations, conducted through MGE, which generate and distribute electricity to approximately 163,000 customers in Dane County, Wisconsin, 

Regulated gas utility operations, conducted through MGE, which distribute natural gas to approximately 176,000 customers in seven south-central and western Wisconsin counties, 

Nonregulated energy operations, conducted through MGE Power and its subsidiaries, which owns interests in electric generating capacity that is leased to MGE, 

Transmission investments, representing our equity investment in ATC, which owns and operates electric transmission facilities primarily in Wisconsin, and ATC Holdco, a company created to facilitate out-of-state electric transmission development and investments, and 

All other, which includes corporate operations and services. 

MGE will continue to focus on growing earnings while controlling operating and fuel costs. MGE's goal is to provide safe and efficient operations in addition to providing customer value. We believe it is critical to maintain a strong credit rating consistent with financial strength in MGE in order to accomplish these goals. 
 
 The ownership/leasing structure for our nonregulated energy operations was adopted under applicable state regulatory guidelines for MGE's participation in these generation facilities, consisting principally of a stable return on the equity investment in the new generation facilities over the term of the related leases. The nonregulated energy operations include an ownership interest in two coal-fired generating units in Oak Creek, Wisconsin and a partial ownership of a cogeneration project on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. A third party operates the units in Oak Creek, and MGE operates the cogeneration project. Due to the nature of MGE's participation in these facilities, the results of MGE Energy's nonregulated operations are also consolidated into MGE's consolidated financial position and results of operations under applicable accounting standards. 
 
 Executive Overview 
 
 We principally earn revenue and generate cash from operations by providing electric and natural gas utility services, including electric power generation and electric power and gas distribution. The earnings and cash flows from the utility business are sensitive to various external factors, including: 
 
 Weather, and its impact on customer sales, 

Economic conditions, including current business activity and employment and their impact on customer demand, 

Regulation and regulatory issues, and their impact on the timing and recovery of costs, 

Energy commodity prices, including natural gas prices, 

Equity price risk pertaining to pension related assets, 

Credit market conditions, including interest rates and our debt credit rating, 

Environmental laws and regulations, including adopted and pending environmental rule changes, and 

Other factors listed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, MGE Energy's earnings were 40.9 million or 1.13 per share compared to 37.9 million or 1.05 per share during the same period in the prior year. MGE's earnings during the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 33.3 million compared to 30.5 million during the same period in the prior year. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, MGE Energy's earnings were 98.5 million or 2.72 per share compared to 97.6 million or 2.70 per share during the same period in the prior year. MGE's earnings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 75.9 million compared to 76.8 million during the same period in the prior year.

Our net income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily reflects the effects of the following factors: 
 
 Electric Utility 
 An increase in electric investments, as part of the 2024 rate case, contributed to earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Unfavorable weather contributed to lower electric residential sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. Electric residential sales remained flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. Also contributing to higher third quarter electric earnings is lower fuel costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the 2024 fuel cost plan approved by the PSCW. 
 
 Gas Utility 
 Lower gas retail sales resulting from warmer than normal weather in the first quarter of 2024 contributed to lower gas earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Gas retail sales decreased approximately 7 . Heating degree days (a measure for determining the impact of weather during the heating season) decreased by approximately 9 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Significant Events 
 
 The following events affected the first nine months of 2024: 
 
 2024/2025 Rate Proceeding: In December 2023, the PSCW approved a 1.54 increase to electric rates and 2.44 increase to gas rates for 2024. The PSCW also approved a 4.17 increase to electric rates and 1.32 increase to gas rates in 2025. MGE filed a 2025 Fuel Cost Plan with the PSCW in June 2024. The plan would lower the 2025 increase in electric rates to 2.47 , reflecting lower expected fuel costs. MGE expects a final decision from the PSCW on the Fuel Cost Plan by the end of 2024. See " Other Matters " below for additional information on the 2024/2025 rate proceeding. 
 
 The 2024/2025 rate order includes an earnings sharing mechanism, under which, if MGE earns above the 9.7 ROE authorized in the rate order: (i) the utility will retain 100 of earnings for the first 15 basis points above the authorized ROE; (ii) 50 of the next 60 basis points will be required to be deferred and returned to customers; and (iii) 100 of any remaining excess earnings will be required to be refunded to customers. The earnings calculation excludes fuel rules adjustments.

(b) MGE received specific approval to recover 100 AFUDC. After tax, MGE recognized 4.0 million and 2.0 million of AFUDC equity through September 30, 2024, on Paris and Darien, respectively, during construction. AFUDC has been excluded from the costs incurred in the table above. 

(c) Estimated costs are expected to exceed PSCW previously approved CA levels. Notifications are provided to the PSCW when costs increase above CA levels. MGE has and will continue to request recovery of the updates in its rate case proceedings. 

(d) Pending approval by the PSCW. 

In the near term, several items may affect us, including: 
 
 2023 Annual Fuel Proceeding: MGE had fuel savings in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, MGE had deferred 7.2 million of 2023 fuel savings. The PSCW has completed the annual review of 2023 fuel costs and approved MGE's return of these savings over a three-month period from October 2024 through December 2024. There was no change to the costs to be refunded as a result of the fuel rule proceedings from the amount MGE deferred in 2023. 
 
 ATC ROE: As discussed in " Other Matters " below, ATC's authorized ROE, which is used in calculating its rates and revenues, is the subject of a challenge before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). A decrease in ATC's ROE could result in lower equity earnings and distributions from ATC in the future. We derived approximately 6.0 and 5.7 of our net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, from our investment in ATC. 
 
 Environmental Initiatives: There are proposed legislative rules and initiatives involving matters related to air emissions, water effluent, hazardous materials, and greenhouse gases, all of which affect generation plant capital expenditures and operating costs as well as future operational planning. Legislation and rulemaking addressing climate change and related matters could significantly affect the costs of owning and operating fossil-fueled generating plants. We would expect to seek and receive recovery of any such costs in rates. However, it is difficult to estimate the amount of such costs due to the uncertainty as to the timing and form of any legislation or rules, the timing and effects of any judicial review, and the scope and time of the recovery of costs in rates, which may occur after those costs have been incurred and paid. 
 
 Future Generation 80 carbon reduction target by 2030 (from 2005 levels): MGE has outlined initiatives to achieve our raised target. 
 
 Transitioning away from coal. Columbia: MGE, along with the other plant co-owners, announced plans to retire Columbia Unit 1 and Unit 2. Final timing and retirement dates for Units 1 and 2 continue to be evaluated and depend upon operational, regulatory, capacity needs and availability, and other factors impacting one or more of the Columbia co-owners. MGE has a plan, which it continues to evaluate, to replace the generation from Columbia while maintaining electric service reliability. 

Elm Road Units: MGE, along with the plant co-owners, announced plans to end the use of coal as a primary fuel at the Elm Road Units and transition the plant to natural gas. Transition plans and costs will be subject to PSCW approval. MGE's remaining use of coal is expected to be further reduced as the Elm Road Units transition to natural gas. By the end of 2030, MGE expects coal to be used only as a backup fuel at the Elm Road Units. This transition will help MGE meet its 2030 carbon reduction goals. By the end of 2032, MGE expects that the Elm Road Units will be fully transitioned away from coal, which will eliminate coal as an internal generation source for MGE.

Growing renewable generation. MGE is seeking to acquire, or has acquired, a joint interest in several renewable generation projects. The forecasted capital expenditures include announced projects for 198 MW of solar, 97 MW of battery, and 18 MW of wind. See the 2024-2029 capital expenditures forecast included under " Liquidity and Capital Resources " below for information on those projects. 

Natural gas as a fuel source. West Riverside: In June 2024, MGE purchased an additional 25 MW of capacity of West Riverside for approximately 25 million. After purchase, MGE owns 50 MW of capacity of West Riverside. West Riverside is a natural gas-fired generating plant. 

Environmental Initiatives Natural gas distribution: Building upon our long-standing commitment to providing affordable, sustainable energy, MGE has set a goal to achieve net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas distribution system by 2035. If MGE can accelerate plans to achieve net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas system through the evolution of new technologies, such as renewable natural gas it will. MGE is working to reduce overall emissions from its natural gas distribution system cost-effectively. For customers who want to reduce their footprint further, MGE introduced a renewable natural gas program which was made effective starting May 2024 after approval by the PSCW. MGE purchases renewable thermal credits on behalf of customers who voluntarily elect in the program to offset the emissions associated with the customer's monthly natural gas usage. 
 
 Solar Procurement Disruptions: MGE is monitoring import regulations under the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act and the U.S. Department of Commerce new solar tariffs. These disruptions have a potential to impact current and future solar projects which may result in an increase in costs or delays in construction timelines. In the event that such disruptions cause costs to exceed the levels approved for specific projects, we have filed, and expect to continue to file, notifications with the PSCW and expect to request recovery of any increases in MGE's future rate proceedings. See " Other Matters " below for additional information on the solar procurement disruptions. 
 
 Equity Issuance Plans: In September 2024, MGE Energy began issuing new shares of common stock to participants in our Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

Revenue subject to refund. For cost recovery mechanisms, any over-collection of revenues resulting from costs authorized to be collected from customers in rates exceeding actual costs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred, as the over-collection is expected to be refunded to customers in a subsequent period. In the year the over-collection is refunded, rates are reduced and offset as revenue subject to refund. There is no net income impact in the year the costs are refunded. 

Sales to the market. Sales to the market typically occur when MGE has more generation and purchases in the MISO market than are needed for its customer demand. The excess electricity is then sold to other utilities or power marketers in the MISO market. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, market volumes increased compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an increase in sales. Additionally, an increase in the cost of capacity sold further contributed to the increase in sales. The revenue generated from these sales is included in fuel rules costs. See fuel rules discussion in Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. 

Rate changes. In December 2023, the PSCW authorized MGE to increase 2024 rates for retail electric customers by approximately 1.54 . Rates charged to retail customers during the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 2.0 million higher than those charged during the same period in the prior year. See Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further information on the rate increase. Any increase in rates associated with fuel or purchase power costs are generally offset in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.

The 2.4 million decrease in fuel for electric generation was due to an approximately 16 decrease in the average cost primarily driven by lower market prices. Internal generation increased approximately 5 . 
 
 Excluding deferred fuel costs, purchased power decreased 0.5 million. The decrease in purchased power was due to an approximately 10 decrease in average cost. The decrease was partially offset by an approximately 2 increase in market purchases as a result of higher customer sales. Deferred fuel cost recovered during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 2.4 million compared to 0.8 million in the same period of the prior year. 
 
 Fuel and purchased power costs are generally offset by electric revenue and do not have a significant impact on net income. MGE expects to seek and receive recovery of fuel and purchased power costs that exceed the fuel rules bandwidth in customer rates. See Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further information on the fuel rules bandwidth.

Rate changes. In December 2023, the PSCW authorized MGE to increase 2024 rates for retail gas customers by approximately 2.44 . 

MGE recovers the cost of natural gas in its gas segment through the PGA. Under the PGA, MGE is able to pass through to its gas customers the cost of gas. Changes in PGA recoveries affect revenues but do not change net income in view of the pass-through treatment of the costs. Payments for natural gas decreased driving lower rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The average retail rate per therm for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased approximately 2 compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in natural gas commodity costs (recovered through the PGA). 
 
 Cost of gas sold 
 
 Cost of gas sold decreased 0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. Average cost per therm decreased approximately 10 and therms delivered decreased approximately 1 . MGE recovers the cost of natural gas in its gas segment through the PGA as described under gas deliveries and revenue above. 
 
 Consolidated operations and maintenance expenses 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, operations and maintenance expenses increased 3.1 million, compared to the same period in the prior year. The following contributed to the net change:

Increased customer accounts costs are primarily related to collection of deferred bad debt expense from prior years. MGE has received approval to recover deferred bad debt expense from 2020 through 2023 over a two-year period beginning in 2024. Bad debt expense is generally offset by electric revenue and does not have a significant impact on net income. 

Increased transmission costs are primarily a result of an increase in transmission rate and collection of deferred costs from prior 

35 

years. Transmission costs represent ATC and MISO network transmission expenses authorized to collect in rates. The PSCW has approved MGE to defer as a regulatory asset or liability, the difference between actual costs included in rates and to be recovered or refunded in a future rate proceeding. Transmission cost is generally offset by electric revenue and does not have a significant impact on net income. 

Decreased administrative and general costs are primarily related to a decrease in pension and other postretirement service costs. These costs are generally offset by electric revenue and do not have a significant impact on net income. 

Consolidated depreciation expense 
 
 Electric depreciation expense increased 1.5 million and gas depreciation expense increased 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. Badger Hollow II was placed in service in December 2023. The timing of the in-service dates contributed to the increase in electric depreciation expense. 
 
 Electric and gas other income 
 
 Electric other income decreased 4.3 million and gas other income decreased 1.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily related to pension and other postretirement excluding service costs. 
 
 Nonregulated Energy Operations - MGE Energy and MGE 
 
 The nonregulated energy operations are conducted through MGE Energy's subsidiaries: MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF), which have been formed to own and lease electric generating capacity to assist MGE. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net income at the nonregulated energy operations segment was 6.1 million and 5.6 million, respectively. 
 
 Transmission Investment Operations - MGE Energy 
 
 The transmission investment segment holds our interest in ATC and ATC Holdco, and its income reflects our equity in the earnings of those investments. ATC Holdco was formed in December 2016 to pursue transmission development opportunities that typically have long development and investment lead times before becoming operational. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income at the transmission investment segment primarily reflects ATC's operations and was 2.9 million and 2.7 million, respectively. In October 2024, FERC issued a ruling eliminating the risk premium in the ROE calculation resulting in a 4-basis point reduction in the base ROE from 10.02 to 9.98 . See Footnote 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for summarized financial information regarding ATC and " Other Matters " below for additional information concerning ATC and FERC ruling on ROE. 
 
 Consolidated Income Taxes - MGE Energy and MGE 
 
 See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for the effective tax rate reconciliation. 
 
 Noncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax - MGE 
 
 Noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflects the accounting required for MGE Energy's interest in MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF). MGE Energy owns 100 of MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus. They are not owned by MGE. Due to the contractual agreements for these projects with MGE, the entities are considered VIEs with respect to MGE and their results are consolidated with those of MGE, the primary beneficiary of the VIEs.

Rate changes. In December 2023, the PSCW authorized MGE to increase 2024 rates for retail electric customers by approximately 1.54 . Rates charged to retail customers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 5.3 million higher than those charged during the same period in the prior year. See Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further information on the rate increase. Any increase in rates associated with fuel or purchase power costs are generally offset in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. 

Customer fixed and demand charges. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, fixed and demand charges increased 2.3 million primarily attributable to the increase in demand charges for commercial customers. 

Revenue subject to refund. For cost recovery mechanisms, any over-collection of revenues resulting from costs authorized to be collected from customers in rates exceeding actual costs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred, as the over-collection is expected to be refunded to customers in a subsequent period. In the year the over-collection is refunded, rates are reduced and offset as revenue subject to refund. There is no net income impact in the year the costs are refunded. 

Volume. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, residential sales decreased by approximately 2 compared to the same period in the prior year. This decrease was driven by weather conditions during the heating months. This change was a result of a warmer April 2023 compared to 2024 which impacted residential sales. 

Sales to the market. Sales to the market typically occur when MGE has more generation and purchases in the MISO market than are needed for its customer demand. The excess electricity is then sold to other utilities or power marketers in the MISO market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, market volumes increased compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an increase in sales. However, the cost of capacity sold decreased offsetting the revenue generated from increased sales to the market from excess generation and purchases. The revenue generated from these sales is included in fuel rules costs. See fuel rules discussion in Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.

Transmission cost is generally offset by electric revenue and does not have a significant impact on net income. 

Increased electric production expenses are primarily related to operating and maintenance costs for renewable generating facilities. MGE continues to add new renewable generation sites including the second phase of Badger Hollow which went online in December 2023. 

Increased distribution expenses in 2024 are primarily related to the May 2024 storm response costs. 

Decreased administrative and general costs are primarily related to a decrease in pension and other postretirement service costs. These costs are generally offset by electric revenue and do not have a significant impact on net income. 

Consolidated depreciation expense 
 
 Electric depreciation expense increased 4.7 million and gas depreciation expense increased 0.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. MGE purchased West Riverside in March 2023 and Badger Hollow II was placed in service in December 2023. The timing of the in-service dates contributed to the increase in electric depreciation expense. 
 
 Electric and gas other income 
 
 Electric other income decreased 5.6 million and gas other income decreased 4.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily related to pension and other postretirement excluding service costs.

Nonregulated Energy Operations - MGE Energy and MGE 
 
 The nonregulated energy operations are conducted through MGE Energy's subsidiaries: MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF), which have been formed to own and lease electric generating capacity to assist MGE. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net income at the nonregulated energy operations segment was 18.0 million and 16.7 million, respectively. 
 
 Transmission Investment Operations - MGE Energy 
 
 The transmission investment segment holds our interest in ATC and ATC Holdco, and its income reflects our equity in the earnings of those investments. ATC Holdco was formed in December 2016 to pursue transmission development opportunities that typically have long development and investment lead times before becoming operational. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income at the transmission investment segment primarily reflects ATC's operations and was 8.4 million and 7.9 million, respectively. In October 2024, FERC issued a ruling eliminating the risk premium in the ROE calculation resulting in a 4-basis point reduction in the base ROE from 10.02 to 9.98 . See Footnote 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for summarized financial information regarding ATC and " Other Matters " below for additional information concerning ATC and FERC ruling on ROE. 
 
 All Other Operations - MGE Energy 
 
 Other income 
 
 The increase of 1.0 million in other income from all other operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily results from decreased investment distribution losses from our venture capital funds compared to the same period in the prior year. These venture capital investments support early-stage companies working to advance smart technologies, the customer experience, distributed energy resources, electrification, cybersecurity, and other priorities for utility companies such as greater sustainability. 
 
 Consolidated Income Taxes - MGE Energy and MGE 
 
 See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for the effective tax rate reconciliation. 
 
 Noncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax - MGE 
 
 Noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflects the accounting required for MGE Energy's interest in MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF). MGE Energy owns 100 of MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus. They are not owned by MGE. Due to the contractual agreements for these projects with MGE, the entities are considered VIEs with respect to MGE and their results are consolidated with those of MGE, the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. The following table shows MGE Energy's noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflected on MGE's consolidated statement of income:

(a) Includes actual capital expenditures already incurred in 2024 and estimated capital expenditures for the remainder of the year. 

Forecasted capital expenditures are based upon management's assumptions with respect to future events, including the timing and amount of expenditures associated with environmental compliance initiatives, legislative and regulatory action, supply chain and market disruptions, customer demand and support for electrification and renewable energy resources, energy conservation programs, load growth, the timing of any required regulatory approvals, and the adequacy of rate recovery. Actual events may differ materially from these assumptions and result in material changes to those forecasted amounts. 
 
 MGE is targeting at least 80 carbon reduction from electric generation by 2030 (from 2005 levels) and net-zero carbon electricity by 2050. Solar, wind, and battery storage projects are a major step toward deep decarbonization and greater use of clean energy sources in pursuit of our goal. In addition, natural gas generation projects help enable MGE's clean energy transition and ensure reliability for customers as the energy supply is decarbonized. MGE continues to evaluate solar, wind, battery storage, and natural gas generation projects that align with its goals as legacy fossil fuel-fired facilities are retired.

MGE continues to assess the potential impact of procurement disruptions on current and future solar projects that may result in an increase in costs or delays in construction timelines. In the event that such disruptions cause costs to exceed the levels approved for specific projects, we have filed, and expect to continue to file, notifications with the PSCW and expect to request recovery of any increases in MGE's future rate proceedings. See further information on procurement disruptions discussed under " Other Matters " section below. 
 
 Columbia Energy Storage Project: In August 2024, MGE was included in a Joint Application to develop an Energy Dome closed-loop gas-to-liquid solution. This project would use vaporized liquid carbon dioxide to power an electric generating turbine. MGE holds a 19 ownership interest in this project. 
 
 West Riverside: In June 2024, MGE purchased an additional 25 MW of capacity of West Riverside for approximately 25 million. After purchase, MGE owns 50 MW of capacity of West Riverside. West Riverside is a natural gas-fired generating plant. 
 
 Electric and Gas Distribution: In 2024 through 2029, electric and gas capital expenditures include investment in enhanced metering solutions to provide customers with more timely and detailed energy use information. Investments in advanced metering infrastructure will provide additional benefits including outage and demand response and automated meter reading capabilities. Forecasted total capital expenditures for those years is approximately 57 million. 
 
 Cash Used for Financing Activities 
 
 The principal sources and uses of cash are related to short-term and long-term borrowings and repayments and the payment of cash dividends.

 Rate Matters 
 
 In December 2023, the PSCW approved the 2024/2025 rate application for an increase of 1.54 for electric rates and a 2.44 increase for gas rates in 2024. The PSCW also approved a 4.17 increase for electric rates and a 1.32 increase to gas rates for 2025. MGE filed a 2025 Fuel Cost Plan with the PSCW in June 2024. The plan would lower the 2025 increase in electric rates to 2.47 , reflecting lower expected fuel costs. MGE expects a final decision from the PSCW on the Fuel Cost Plan by the end of 2024.

(a) Average rate base amounts reflect MGE's allocated share of rate base and do not include construction work in progress (CWIP) or a cash working capital allowance and were calculated using a forecasted 13-month average for the test periods. The PSCW provides a return on selected CWIP and a cash working capital allowance by adjusting the percentage return on rate base. 

(b) 50 of the forecasted 13-month average CWIP for the test periods earns an AFUDC return. Projects eligible to earn 100 AFUDC are excluded from this balance and discussed further in the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Significant Events section. 

(c) Authorized returns on common equity may not be indicative of actual returns earned or projections of future returns, as actual returns will be affected by the volume of electricity or gas sold. 

See Footnote 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion of rate proceedings and an earnings sharing mechanism if MGE earns above the authorized return on common equity in the rate order. 
 
 ATC 
 
 MISO transmission owners, including ATC, are involved in two complaints filed at FERC by several parties challenging that the base ROE in effect for MISO transmission owners, including ATC, was no longer just and reasonable. Each complaint provided for a 15-month statutory refund period: November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015 (the "First Complaint Period") and February 12, 2015 through May 11, 2016 (the "Second Complaint Period"). 
 
 In May 2020, FERC issued an order further refining the methodology for setting authorized ROE. This refined methodology increased the authorized ROE from 9.88 to 10.02 . This base ROE is effective for the First Complaint Period and for all periods following September 2016. This order also dismissed the second complaint. Accordingly, no refunds were ordered for the Second Complaint Period. 
 
 Several petitions for review of FERC s prior orders were filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the "Court") and an oral argument was held in November 2021. In August 2022, the Court ruled that four of the five arguments made by the complaining parties were unpersuasive. However, the Court agreed that FERC s decision to reintroduce a risk-premium model into its ROE methodology was arbitrary and capricious. The Court vacated the underlying orders for the First Complaint Period and remanded to FERC for further proceedings. In October 2024, FERC issued a ruling eliminating the risk premium in the ROE calculation resulting in a 4-basis point reduction in the base ROE from 10.02 to 9.98 . FERC also affirmed its prior decision to dismiss the second complaint. ATC must provide refunds, with interest, by December 2025 covering the First Complaint Period and all periods following September 2016. Prior to the ruling, our share of ATC s earnings reflected a possible loss of approximately 1.2 million, inclusive of interest and net of tax, for a possible additional refund for the First Complaint Period and for the period following the Second Complaint Period. As a result of the October 2024 ruling, during the fourth quarter 2024 our earnings in ATC will reflect an approximately 0.8 million reduction of our reserve. 
 
 We derived approximately 6.0 and 5.7 of our net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, from our investment in ATC. 
 
 Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act 
 
 In June 2021, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued a Withhold Release Order (WRO) against silica-based products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., a company located in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. As a result of this WRO, CBP is holding many solar panels imported into the United States until importers can prove that the panels do not contain materials originating from this region. The Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act (UFLPA), a federal law that became effective on June 21, 2022, further established that all goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in Xinjiang or by certain defined entities are prohibited from U.S. importation. Suppliers for MGE's current solar projects were able to provide the CBP sufficient documentation to meet WRO compliance requirements, and MGE expects the same will be true for UFLPA purposes, however we 
 45 

cannot currently predict what, if any, impact the UFLPA will have on the overall supply of solar panels into the United States and the related impact to timing and cost of solar projects included in our capital plan. In the event that such disruptions cause costs to exceed the levels approved for specific projects, we have filed and expect to continue to file a notification with the PSCW and expect to request recovery of any cost increases in MGE's future rate proceedings. 
 
 U.S. Department of Commerce - Solar Cells and Modules 
 
 In August 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued its final determination on a solar tariff investigation that began in 2022, finding that Chinese manufacturers were circumventing tariffs on solar panels by shipping them through four Southeast Asian countries. A 24-month exemption from tariffs for solar panel and module imports from these four countries was in effect from June 2022 until June 6, 2024. In May 2024, the Biden Administration announced that bifacial solar panels would be subject to safeguard tariffs under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, of which they were previously excluded. President Biden also directed U.S. Trade Representatives to increase tariffs under Section 301 from 25 to 50 on solar cells and modules. MGE continues to assess the potential impact of these tariffs on current and future solar projects which may result in an increase in costs or delays in construction timelines. In the event that such disruptions cause costs to exceed the levels approved for specific projects, we have filed and expect to continue to file a notification with the PSCW and expect to request recovery of any cost increases in MGE's future rate proceedings.

 See Footnote 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for discussion of new accounting pronouncements. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 There were no material changes to the market risks disclosed in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K , except as noted below. 
 
 Equity Price Risk - Pension-Related Assets 
 
 MGE currently funds its liabilities related to employee benefits through trust funds. These funds, which include investments in debt and equity securities, are managed by various third-party investment managers. Changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities. The value of employee benefit plan assets has increased by approximately 13 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, each registrant's management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures related to the recording, processing, summarization, and reporting of information in its periodic reports that it files with the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to that registrant, including its subsidiaries, is accumulated and made known to that registrant's management, including these officers, by other employees of that registrant and its subsidiaries as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and that this information is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated, and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. The evaluations take into account changes in the internal and external operating environments that may impact those controls and procedures. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Also, MGE Energy does not control or manage certain of its unconsolidated entities and thus, its access and ability to apply its procedures to those entities is more limited than is the case for its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, each registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Each registrant intends to strive continually to improve its disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of its financial reporting. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in either registrant's internal controls over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect materially, that registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
