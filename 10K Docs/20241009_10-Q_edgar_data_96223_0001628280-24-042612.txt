 million, a decrease in Property and equipment of million, and a decrease in Goodwill of million. 
 Stratos 
 We historically held a voting interest in Stratos. In March 2023, certain noteholders of Global Brokerage Inc. GLBR filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against GLBR and its subsidiary, Global Brokerage Holdings LLC Holdings ), which holds a voting equity interest in Stratos. On September 14, 2023, we completed a foreclosure on the collateral that GLBR had pledged to secure its obligations under a credit facility, which consisted of GLBR s equity interest in Stratos. As a result of the foreclosure, we own of the outstanding interests of Stratos; and Stratos has become a consolidated subsidiary. 
 In connection with the acquisition of the additional interests in Stratos, we extinguished our senior secured term loan to Stratos of million and recognized a gain of million, which is reflected in Principal transactions revenues. Upon the acquisition, we remeasured our previously existing interest at fair value and recognized a loss of million, in Other revenues, representing the excess of the carrying value of the interest of our million equity method investment over its fair value at the date of acquisition. The fair value of the previously existing equity interest was measured using an income approach based on estimates of future expected cash flows applying a risk-adjusted discount rate of . Critical estimates to derive future expected cash flows includes the use of projected revenues and expenses, applicable tax rates and depreciation factors with the risk-adjusted discount rate based upon an estimated weighted average cost of capital for the acquired business. 
 consideration, other than the nonmonetary exchange of our senior secured term loan, was transferred in connection with the foreclosure, which resulted in us obtaining ownership of the outstanding interests of Stratos. In applying acquisition accounting, we estimated the overall enterprise fair value of Stratos consistent with the methodology utilized to fair value our previously existing equity interest. The enterprise fair value was allocated based on the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities resulting in a gain of million and goodwill of million. 
 The results of Stratos operations have been included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings from the date of acquisition on September 14, 2023. 
 OpNet 
 We historically owned of the common shares and of the voting rights of OpNet and various classes of convertible preferred stock issued by OpNet (the preferred shares ). On November 30, 2023, we provided notice of our intent to convert certain classes of our preferred shares into common shares and, as a result, we obtained control of OpNet. Upon conversion on May 7, 2024, our ownership increased to of the common shares and our voting rights increased to of the aggregate voting rights of OpNet. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2024, we exchanged million of our shareholder loans for additional preferred shares and also subscribed to additional 

preferred shares of million at a price per share of . During the second quarter of 2024, we provided an additional shareholder loan of million and subscribed to additional preferred shares of million at a price per share of . In June 2024, we provided an additional shareholder loan of million. 
 OpNet was considered to be a variable interest entity and we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of OpNet. Accordingly, we consolidated OpNet and the assets and liabilities of OpNet in our consolidated financial statements. The initial consolidation of OpNet was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and we remeasured our previously existing interests at fair value and recognized a gain of million, representing the excess of the fair value of our previously existing interests over the carrying value of our investment of million. The fair value of the previously existing interests was measured based on an estimate of what could be recognized in a sale transaction for certain net operating assets of OpNet, which have been classified as held for sale, and OpNet s percentage ownership of Tessellis common shares based on the publicly listed exchange price of Tessellis on November 30, 2023. consideration was transferred in connection with the consolidation. 
 The remaining identifiable assets and assumed liabilities of OpNet primarily represent the assets and liabilities of Tessellis. An enterprise value for Tessellis was estimated based on its market capitalization at November 30, 2023, which was then allocated to the identifiable assets, including intangible assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of the entity using an income approach, which calculates the present value of the estimated economic benefit of future cash flows, in order to determine the fair value of the identified customer relationships and Tessellis trade name. Property and equipment and developed technology assets were valued using a replacement cost methodology. Critical estimates included future expected cash flows, including forecasted revenues and expenses, and applicable discount rates. Discount rates used to compute the present value of expected net cash flows were based upon estimated weighted average cost of capital. The initial allocation of the purchase price resulted in the recognition of goodwill relating to Tessellis of million. During the first quarter of 2024, we decreased goodwill by million to million based on measurement period adjustments. 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, Tessellis executed various acquisitions and, as a result, recognized assets and liabilities of million and million, respectively, on the acquisition dates. Total assets primarily relate to goodwill and intangible assets. We are in the process of finalizing purchase price allocation adjustments related to the identified assets and may adjust these amounts upon completion of our assessment in subsequent reporting periods. 
 In February 2024, OpNet agreed to sell substantially all of its wholesale operating assets to Wind Tre S.p.A., a subsidiary of CK Hutchison Group Telecom Holdings Ltd. The sale closed in August 2024 and we received net cash proceeds of million and recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of million. The sale of OpNet did not include our interest in Tessellis.

 million and million, respectively, primarily comprised of CDOs and CLOs, Other ABS, Loans and other receivables, Investments at fair value, certain derivatives, RMBS, CMBS and sovereign obligations. At August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, liability exclusions consisted of million and million, respectively, primarily comprised of certain derivatives, loans, CMBS, corporate equity securities and corporate debt securities. 

Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurement from Use of Significant Unobservable Inputs 
 For recurring fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the uncertainty of the fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs and interrelationships between those unobservable inputs (if any) are described below: 
 Non-exchange-traded securities, corporate debt securities, CDOs and CLOs, loans and other receivables, other ABS, private equity securities, certain derivatives and structured notes using a market approach valuation technique. A significant increase (decrease) in the price of the private equity securities, non-exchange-traded securities, corporate debt securities, CDOs and CLOs, other ABS, loans and other receivables or structured notes would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. A significant increase (decrease) in the revenue multiple related to private equity securities would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. A significant increase (decrease) in the EBITDA multiple related to non-exchange-traded securities would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. A significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate/security yield related to private equity securities would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Depending on whether we are a receiver or (payer) of basis points upfront, a significant increase in basis points would result in a significant increase (decrease) in the fair value measurement of options. 
 Loans and other receivables, corporate debt securities, CMBS, other ABS and other secured financings using scenario analysis. A significant increase (decrease) in the possible recovery rates of the cash flow outcomes underlying the financial instrument would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement for the financial instrument. 
 CDOs and CLOs, corporate debt securities and other ABS using a discounted cash flow valuation technique. A significant increase (decrease) in isolation in the constant default rate, loss severity or cumulative loss rate would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. The impact of changes in the constant prepayment rate and duration would have differing impacts depending on the capital structure and type of security. A significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate/security yield would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
 Derivative equity options using volatility benchmarking. A significant increase (decrease) in volatility would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.

 Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis 
 Certain assets were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are not included in the tables above. Impairment losses for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023 attributable to an equity method investment were million and million, respectively, and were recognized in Other revenues. The assets of the equity method investment were included within the Asset Management reportable business segment. The equity method investment was sold during the fourth quarter of 2023 and we recognized a gain of million. The equity method investment would be categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value was based on our best estimate of what could be recognized in a sale transaction for the investment.

 Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value 
 Certain of our financial instruments are not carried at fair value but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These financial assets include Cash and cash equivalents and Cash and securities segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing and depository organizations and would generally be presented within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 We have equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which we account for at cost, minus impairment, which are presented within Other assets and were million and at August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively. Net losses of million and million were recognized on these investments during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, respectively. There were impairments on these investments during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024. Impairments on these investments during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023 were million and million, respectively.

 Secured Financing Receivables . In evaluating secured financing receivables (reverse repurchases agreements, securities borrowing arrangements, and margin loans), the underlying collateral maintenance provisions are taken into consideration. The underlying contractual collateral maintenance for significantly all of our secured financing receivables requires that the counterparty continually adjust the collateralization amount, securing the credit exposure on these contracts. Collateralization levels for our secured financing receivables are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of acceptable collateral that is monitored daily and adjusted to mitigate the potential of any credit losses. Credit losses are not recognized for secured financing receivables where the underlying collateral s fair value is equal to or exceeds the asset s amortized cost basis. In cases where the collateral s fair value does not equal or exceed the amortized cost basis, the allowance for credit losses, if any, is limited to the difference between the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date and the amortized cost basis of the financial assets. 
 Broker Receivables . Our receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations include deposits of cash with exchange clearing organizations to meet margin requirements, amounts due from clearing organizations for daily variation settlements, securities failed-to-deliver or receive, receivables and payables for fees and commissions, and receivables arising from unsettled securities or loans transactions. These receivables generally do not give rise to material credit risk and have a remote probability of default either because of their short-term nature or due to the credit protection framework inherent in the design and operations of brokers, dealers and clearing organizations. As such, generally, no allowance for credit losses is held against these receivables. 
 Other Financial Assets . For all other financial assets measured at amortized cost, we estimate expected credit losses over the financial assets life as of the reporting date based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, we recognized bad debt expense of million related to receivables associated with our asset management arrangements with Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers. 
 Investment Banking Fee Receivables. Our allowance for credit losses on our investment banking fee receivables uses a provisioning matrix based on the shared risk characteristics and historical loss experience for such receivables. In some instances, we may adjust the allowance calculated based on the provision matrix to incorporate a specific allowance based on the unique credit risk profile of a receivable.

 Goodwill Impairment Testing 
 The quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of the reporting unit. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill and allocated intangible assets. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, the goodwill for the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. Allocated tangible equity plus allocated goodwill and intangible assets are used for the carrying amount of each reporting unit. 
 We test goodwill allocated to our Investment Banking, Equities, Fixed Income and Asset Management reporting units annually on August 1 and test goodwill allocated to other individual

 million and million, respectively. Interest on these credit facilities is based on an adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a spread or other adjusted rates, as defined in the various credit agreements.

 Additionally, at August 31, 2024, we had other outstanding equity commitments to invest up to million with strategic affiliates and million to various other investments. 
 Loan Commitments. From time to time, we make commitments to extend credit to clients and to strategic affiliates. These commitments and any related drawdowns of these facilities typically have fixed maturity dates and are contingent on certain representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower. At August 31, 2024, we had outstanding loan commitments of million to clients and million to strategic affiliates. 
 Loan commitments outstanding at August 31, 2024 also include our portion of the outstanding secured revolving credit facility provided to Jefferies Finance, to support loan underwritings by Jefferies Finance. 
 Underwriting Commitments. In connection with investment banking activities, we may from time to time provide underwriting commitments to our clients in connection with capital raising transactions. 
 Forward Starting Reverse Repos and Repos. We enter into commitments to take possession of securities with agreements to resell on a forward starting basis and to sell securities with agreements to repurchase on a forward starting basis that are primarily secured by U.S. government and agency securities. 
 Other Unfunded Commitments. Other unfunded commitments include obligations in the form of revolving notes, warehouse financings and debt securities to provide financing to asset-backed and CLO vehicles. Upon advancing funds, drawn amounts are collateralized by the assets of an entity. Other unfunded commitments also include written put options to certain bondholders of an equity method investee. 
 Guarantees 
 Derivative Contracts. As a dealer, we make markets and trade in a variety of derivative instruments. Certain derivative contracts that we have entered into meet the accounting definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including credit default swaps, written foreign currency options and written equity put options. On certain of these contracts, such as written interest rate caps and foreign currency options, the maximum payout cannot be quantified since the increase in interest or foreign exchange rates are not contractually limited by the terms of the contract. As such, we have disclosed notional values as a measure of our maximum potential payout under these contracts. 
 Total derivative contracts 

The derivative contracts deemed to meet the definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP are before consideration of hedging transactions and only reflect a partial or one-sided component of any risk exposure. Written equity options and written credit default swaps are often executed in a strategy that is in tandem with long cash instruments e.g. , equity and debt securities). We substantially mitigate our exposure to market risk on these contracts through hedges, such as other derivative contracts and/or cash instruments, and we manage the risk associated with these contracts in the context of our overall risk management framework. We believe notional amounts overstate our expected payout and that fair value of these contracts is a more relevant measure of our obligations. At August 31, 2024, the fair value of derivative contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee is approximately million. 
 HomeFed. For real estate development projects, we are generally required to obtain infrastructure improvement bonds at the beginning of construction work and warranty bonds upon completion of such improvements. These bonds are issued by surety companies to guarantee a municipality satisfactory completion of a project. As the planned area is developed and the municipality accepts the improvements, the bonds are released. At August 31, 2024, the aggregate amount of infrastructure improvement bonds outstanding was million. 
 Standby Letters of Credit. At August 31, 2024, we provided guarantees to certain counterparties in the form of standby letters of credit in the amount of million, with a weighted average maturity of less than . Standby letters of credit commit us to make payment to the beneficiary if the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a contractual arrangement with that beneficiary. Since commitments associated with these collateral instruments may expire unused, the amount shown does not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirement. 
 Other Guarantees. We are members of various exchanges and clearing houses. In the normal course of business, we provide guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges. These guarantees generally are required under the standard membership agreements, such that members are required to guarantee the performance of other members. Additionally, if a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing house, other members would be required to meet these shortfalls. To mitigate these performance risks, the exchanges and clearing houses often require members to post collateral. Our obligations under such guarantees could exceed the collateral amounts posted. Our maximum potential liability under these arrangements cannot be quantified; however, the potential for us to be required to make payments under such guarantees is deemed remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these arrangements. Additionally, we provide certain indemnifications in connection with third-party clearing and execution arrangements whereby a third-party may clear and settle transactions on behalf of our clients. These indemnifications generally have standard contractual terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Our obligations in respect of such transactions are secured by the assets in our client s account, as well as any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled on behalf of our client. However, we believe that it is unlikely we would have to make any material payments under these arrangements and no material liabilities related to these indemnifications have been recognized.

Executive Summary 
 Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 Versus August 31, 2023 
 Consolidated Results 
 Net revenues were 1.68 billion, up 42.4 compared with 1.18 billion for the prior year quarter, reflecting strong performance and continued momentum in Investment Banking (up 47.3 ), including a record quarter in Advisory (up 76.7 ), as well as strong performance in Equities (up 42.3 and solid performance in Fixed income (up 13.2 ). 
 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were 252.7 million, compared with 91.1 million for the prior year quarter. 
 Net earnings from discontinued operations (including gain on disposal), net of income taxes were 6.4 million and reflects the current quarter results of OpNet and a gain on the sale of OpNet, which closed in August 2024. 
 Business Results 
 Investment banking net revenues were 949.5 million, up 47.3 compared with 644.6 million in the prior year quarter. Advisory had its best quarter on record with net revenues of 592.5 million, up 76.7 compared with 335.3 million for the prior year quarter, driven by market share gains and an increase in global mergers and acquisitions activity. Total underwriting net revenues of 333.2 million were 25.8 higher than the prior year quarter of 264.9 million, driven by stronger leveraged finance activity. Equity underwriting net revenues remained flat compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Equities net revenues of 381.4 million were 42.3 higher compared to 268.0 million for the prior year quarter, due to increased volumes and more favorable trading opportunities, particularly within our cash and electronic businesses, as well as stronger results in our prime services business. 
 Fixed income net revenues of 289.2 million were 13.2 higher compared to 255.6 million for the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting stronger results across our credit trading businesses. 
 Asset management net revenues were 59.0 million, compared with net revenues of 10.1 million in the prior year quarter. Other investments net revenues for the current quarter meaningfully increased largely due to the inclusion of Stratos and Tessellis in our overall results as these entities became consolidated subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2023. Investment return revenues decreased from the prior year quarter as the market environment for certain of our strategies proved challenging during the current quarter. 
 Non-interest Expenses 
 Compensation and benefits expense was 889.1 million, an increase of 38.0 compared with 644.1 million for the prior year quarter. Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of Net revenues was 52.8 , compared with 54.5 for the prior year quarter. The ratio for the current quarter was impacted by the consolidation of Stratos and Tessellis, which have lower compensation ratios. 

Non-compensation expenses were 541.8 million, an increase of 21.2 compared with 447.0 million for the prior year quarter. Non-compensation expenses were higher due to the inclusion of Tessellis and Stratos as operating subsidiaries following the consolidation of these entities in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in non-compensation expenses is also attributed to increased brokerage and clearing fees associated with increased trading volumes, and higher technology and communications and business development expenses. 
 Nine Months Ended August 31, 2024 Versus August 31, 2023 
 Consolidated Results 
 Net revenues were 5.08 billion, up 45.0 compared with 3.50 billion for the prior year period, reflecting strength across all lines of business primarily due to market share gains. 
 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were 700.7 million, compared with 267.0 million for the prior year period. 
 Our overall results were strong for the current period, reflecting strong performance and continued momentum in Investment Banking. Additionally, our results include the impact of losses associated with our investment in Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers Weiss resulting in a pre-tax loss to us of 57.2 million, 30.6 million of which reduced our net revenues and 26.2 million of which increased our non-compensation expenses. 
 Net losses from discontinued operations (including gain on disposal), net of income taxes were (1.5) million and reflects the current year results of OpNet and a gain on the sale of OpNet, which closed in August 2024. 
 Business Results 
 Investment banking net revenues were 2.49 billion, up 45.6 compared with 1.71 billion in the prior year period. Advisory revenues were 1.21 billion, up 37.0 compared with 886.6 million for the prior year period, attributable primarily to market share gains. Total underwriting net revenues of 1.13 billion were 58.9 higher than the prior year period of 708.9 million, due to increased equity and debt underwriting activity as a result of a more robust equity and general capital markets environment. 
 Equities net revenues of 1.15 billion were 34.7 higher compared to 852.0 million of the prior year period, as increased volumes and more favorable trading opportunities drove stronger results across most of our equities business lines. 
 Fixed income net revenues of 925.8 million were 4.9 higher compared to 883.0 million for the prior year period, driven by stronger results from our distressed trading and securitized markets businesses, partially offset by reduced activity in our global structured solutions business and less favorable results across our emerging markets and municipal securities businesses, which were particularly strong in the prior year period. 

August 2024 Form 10-Q 47 

Asset management net revenues were 488.9 million, compared to 47.7 million in the prior year period. Investment return was higher on improved performance across multiple investment strategies, partially offset by 30.6 million of revenue losses associated with our investment in Weiss. Other investments net revenues for the current year were meaningfully higher than the prior year period largely due to the inclusion of Stratos and Tessellis in our overall results as these entities became consolidated subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Non-interest Expenses 
 Compensation and benefits expense was 2.68 billion, an increase of 39.3 compared with 1.92 billion for the prior year period. Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of Net revenues was 52.7 , compared with 54.9 for the prior year period. The ratio for the current period was impacted by the consolidation of Stratos and Tessellis, which have lower compensation ratios. 
 Non-compensation expenses were 1.70 billion, an increase of 29.4 compared with 1.31 billion for the prior year period. Non-compensation expenses were higher due to the inclusion of Tessellis and Stratos as operating subsidiaries following the consolidation of these entities in the fourth quarter of 2023, offset by the impact of the spin-off of Vitesse Energy in January 2023. The increase in non-compensation expenses is also attributed to increased brokerage and clearing fees associated with increased trading volumes and technology and communication and business development expenses. Other expenses include bad debt expenses largely related to our losses associated with Weiss Strategy Advisers upon its shutdown in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Headcount 
 At August 31, 2024, we had 7,624 employees globally across all of our consolidated subsidiaries within our Investment Banking and Capital Markets and Asset Management reportable segments, an increase of 2,119 employees from our headcount of 5,505 at August 31, 2023. Included within our global headcount are 1,907 employees of our Stratos, Tessellis, HomeFed, and M Science subsidiaries. Of the 2,119 headcount increase, 1,698 relates to recognizing control of Stratos and Tessellis since the fourth quarter of 2023 as the employees of these subsidiaries are now included in our overall headcount. During the past year, we have increased the number of our Investment Banking Managing Directors and related staff, along with additional technology and corporate staff to support our growth and strategic priorities. 
 
 Revenues by Source 
 We present our results as two reportable business segments: Investment Banking and Capital Markets and Asset Management. Additionally, corporate activities are fully allocated to each of these reportable business segments. Beginning in fiscal 2024, we now refer to Merchant banking as Other investments in our Asset Management reportable segment. 
 Net revenues presented for our Investment Banking and Capital Markets reportable segment include allocations of interest income and interest expense as we assess the profitability of these businesses inclusive of the net interest revenue or expense associated with the respective activities, including the net interest cost of allocated short- and long-term debt, which is a function of the mix of each business s associated assets and liabilities and the related funding costs. 

The remainder of our Consolidated Results of Operations is presented on a detailed product and expense basis. Our Revenues by Source is reported along the following business lines: Investment Banking, Equities, Fixed Income and Asset Management. 
 Foreign currency transaction gains or losses, debt valuation adjustments on derivative contracts, gains and losses on investments held in deferred compensation or certain other corporate income items are not considered by management in assessing the financial performance of our operating businesses and are, therefore, not reported as part of our business segment results.

 Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 Versus August 31, 2023 
 Investment banking net revenues were 949.5 million, up 47.3 compared with 644.6 million for the prior year quarter. We have made extensive investments in our investment banking business over the past recent periods, enhancing our capabilities across sectors and regions which has led to market share gains. 
 Advisory net revenues of 592.5 million reflect our best quarter on record and was up 76.7 compared with 335.3 million for the prior year quarter, driven by market share gains attributable to an increase in transaction levels across most sectors in the global mergers and acquisitions markets. 
 Total underwriting net revenues were 333.2 million, an increase of 25.8 from 264.9 million for the prior year quarter, driven by stronger debt underwriting activity across most sectors. Equity underwriting net revenues remained relatively flat compared to the prior year quarter. 

August 2024 Form 10-Q 49 

Other investment banking net revenues were 23.8 million, lower compared with net revenues of 44.5 million for the prior year quarter. Results from our share of the net earnings of our Jefferies Finance joint venture increased from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher net fee income, partially offset by lower net interest income. Revenues from our share of the net earnings of our Berkadia joint venture decreased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower mortgage origination and sales volumes, partially offset by higher interest income and servicing fees attributable to a larger and growing loan servicing portfolio. In addition, during the current quarter, we recognized gains on various equity derivative transactions related to our investment banking activities and revenue from our strategic alliance with SMBC. The current quarter was also impacted by the absence of Foursight due to its sale in April 2024. 
 Our investment banking backlog remains strong heading into year end based on current trends observed, although execution is always uncertain and dependent on market conditions. As an indicator of net revenues in a given future period, backlog snapshots are subject to limitations. The time frame for the realization of revenues from these expected transactions varies and is influenced by factors we do not control. Transactions not included in the estimate may occur, and expected transactions may also be modified or cancelled. 
 Nine Months Ended August 31, 2024 Versus August 31, 2023

 Other investment banking net revenues were 151.0 million, meaningfully higher compared with net revenues of 116.0 million for the prior year period. Results from our share of the net earnings of our Jefferies Finance joint venture increased from the prior year period primarily driven by higher net fee income, partially offset by lower net interest income. Revenues from our share of the net earnings of our Berkadia joint venture increased from the prior year period driven by higher interest income and servicing fees attributable to a larger and growing loan servicing portfolio, partially offset by lower mortgage origination and sales volumes. In addition, during the current year, we recognized gains on various equity derivative transactions related to our investment banking activities, revenue from our strategic alliance with SMBC and a 24.8 million initial gain from the sale of Foursight in April 2024.

 services provided to our clients from which we earn commissions or spread revenue by executing, settling and clearing transactions for clients; 
 advisory services offered to clients; 

financing, securities lending and other prime brokerage services offered to clients, including capital introductions and outsourced trading; and

 Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 Versus August 31, 2023 
 Equities net revenues were 381.4 million, up 42.3 from 268.0 million for the prior year quarter, as increased volumes and more favorable trading opportunities drove stronger results, particularly within our cash and electronic trading businesses, as well as stronger results in our prime services business. 
 Nine Months Ended August 31, 2024 Versus August 31, 2023 
 Equities net revenues were 1.15 billion, up 34.7 from 852.0 million for the prior year period, attributable to market share gain and increased volumes and more favorable trading opportunities driving stronger results across most of our equities business lines, particularly within our cash and electronic trading businesses, as well as stronger results in our prime services business. 
 
 Fixed Income Net Revenues 
 Fixed income is composed of net revenues from: 
 executing transactions for clients and making markets in securitized products, investment grade, high-yield, distressed, emerging markets, municipal and sovereign securities, and bank loans; 
 interest rate derivatives and credit derivatives; and 
 structuring and financing services. 
 Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 Versus August 31, 2023

 Nine Months Ended August 31, 2024 Versus August 31, 2023 
 F ixed income net revenues were 925.8 million, up 4.9 compared to 883.0 million for the prior year period, driven by stronger results from our distressed trading and securitized markets businesses, partially offset by reduced activity in our global structured solutions business and less favorable results across our emerging markets and municipal securities businesses which were particularly strong in the prior year period. 
 
 Asset Management 
 We operate a diversified alternative asset management platform offering institutional clients a range of investment strategies directly and through our affiliated asset managers. We provide certain of our affiliated asset managers access to our global operational infrastructure and support. This may include strategy and product development, daily operations and finance-related activities, compliance, legal and human resources support, as well as marketing and business development. 
 Asset management revenues include the following: 
 management and performance fees from funds and accounts managed by us; 
 revenue from affiliated asset managers where we are entitled to portions of their revenues and/or profits, as well as earnings on our ownership interests in our affiliated asset managers; 

50 
 Jefferies Financial Group Inc. 

investment income from our capital invested in and managed by us and our affiliated asset managers; and 
 revenues from investments held in our other investments portfolio, including consolidated operations from real estate development activities, foreign exchange trading (Stratos consolidated from the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023) and telecommunications activities (OpNet consolidated from the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023 through its sale on in August 2024). Prior periods include revenues from oil and gas activities until the spin-off of our interest in Vitesse Energy in January 2023. 
 Asset management fees and revenues are impacted by the level of assets under management and the performance return of those assets, for the most part on an absolute basis, and, in certain cases, relative to a benchmark or hurdle. These components can be affected by financial markets, profits and losses in the applicable investment portfolios and client capital activity. Further, asset management fees vary with the nature of investment management services. The terms under which clients may terminate our investment management authority, and the requisite notice period for such termination, varies depending on the nature of the investment vehicle and the liquidity of the portfolio assets. In some instances, performance fees and similar revenues are recognized once a year, when they become fixed and determinable and are not probable of being significantly reversed, typically in December. As a result, a significant portion of our performance fees and similar revenues generated from investment returns in a calendar year are recognized in our following fiscal year.

 Compensation and benefits expense consists of salaries, benefits, commissions, annual cash compensation and share-based awards and the amortization of share-based and cash compensation awards to employees. 
 Cash and share-based awards and a portion of cash awards granted to employees as part of year end compensation generally contain provisions such that employees who terminate their employment or are terminated without cause may continue to vest in their awards, so long as those awards are not forfeited as a result of other forfeiture provisions (primarily non-compete clauses) of those awards. Accordingly, the compensation expense for a portion of awards granted at year end as part of annual compensation is recorded during the year of the award. Compensation and benefits expense includes amortization expense associated with these awards to the extent vesting is contingent on future service. In addition, certain awards to our Chief Executive Officer and our President contain market and performance conditions and the awards are amortized over their service periods. 
 Compensation and benefits expense was 889.1 million and 2.68 billion for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively, compared with 644.1 million and 1.92 billion for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, respectively. A significant portion of our compensation expense is highly variable with net revenues. Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of Net revenues was 52.8 and 52.7 for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively, compared with 54.5 and 54.9 for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, respectively. The ratio for the current period was impacted by the consolidation of Stratos and Tessellis, which have much lower compensation rates proportionate to net revenues. 
 Compensation expense related to the amortization of share- and cash-based awards was 117.1 million and 363.7 million for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively, compared with 73.2 million and 219.9 million for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, respectively. 
 At August 31, 2024, we had 7,624 employees globally across all of our consolidated subsidiaries within our Investment Banking and Capital Markets and Asset Management reportable segments, an increase of 2,119 employees from our headcount of 5,505 at August 31, 2023. Included within our global headcount are 1,907 employees of our Stratos, Tessellis, HomeFed, and M Science subsidiaries. Of the 2,119 headcount increase, 1,698 relates to recognizing control of Stratos and Tessellis during the fourth quarter of 2023 as the employees of those subsidiaries are now included in our overall headcount. During the past year, we have increased the number of our Investment Banking Managing Directors and related staff, along with additional technology and corporate staff to support our growth and strategic priorities. 
 Non-interest Expenses (Excluding Compensation and Benefits) 
 Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 Versus August 31, 2023 
 Non-interest expenses, excluding Compensation and benefits, as a percentage of Net revenues was 32.2 and 37.8 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was impacted by the following: 
 Brokerage and clearing fees were higher by 9.9 million primarily due to increased trading volumes. 

Technology and communication were higher by 14.4 million related to the continued development of various trading and management systems, increased market data costs and costs attributed to Stratos and Tessellis. 
 Business development was higher by 26.7 million reflecting increased investment banking and capital markets deal activity. 
 Cost of sales and depreciation and amortization expenses were higher by 56.5 million reflecting the consolidation of Stratos and Tessellis. 
 Other expenses were lower by 13.9 million as bad debt expense was lower for the current quarter and the prior year quarter included charitable donations for Hawaii relief. 
 Nine Months Ended August 31, 2024 Versus August 31, 2023 
 Non-interest expenses, excluding Compensation and benefits, as a percentage of Net revenues was 33.5 and 37.5 for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was impacted by the following: 
 Brokerage and clearing fees were higher by 53.0 million due to increased trading volumes. 
 Technology and communication were higher by 54.8 million related to the continued development of various trading and management systems and increased market data costs. 
 Business development was higher by 72.5 million reflecting increased investment banking and capital markets deal activity. 
 Professional services expenses were higher by 22.4 million primarily on increased transaction related legal fees associated with capital markets transaction and litigation as well as consulting fees related to strategic technology investment initiatives. 
 Cost of sales and depreciation and amortization expenses were higher by 158.6 million primarily reflecting the consolidation of Stratos and Tessellis, partially offset by spin-off of Vitesse Energy in January 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, the provision for income taxes was 78.0 million and 37.1 million, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of 30.9 and 40.8 , respectively. The lower rate for the three months ended August 31, 2024 is primarily due to the higher amount of pre-tax income in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter. 
 For the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, the provision for income taxes was 207.1 million and 75.1 million, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of 29.6 and 28.1 , respectively. The higher rate for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 is primarily due to a smaller impact from share based awards in the current year. 
 
 Accounting Developments 
 There are no accounting standard updates, except as discussed in Note 3, Accounting Developments in our consolidated financial statement included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q which we have either determined are applicable or expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

August 2024 Form 10-Q 53 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Actual results can and may differ from estimates. These differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 
 We believe our application of U.S. GAAP and the associated estimates are reasonable. Our accounting estimates are reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Historically, we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate, and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates. 
 For further discussions of the following significant accounting policies and other significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023. 
 Valuation of Financial Instruments 
 Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased are recorded at fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). Unrealized gains or losses are generally recognized in Principal transactions revenues. 
 Fair Value Hierarchy In determining fair value, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. We apply a hierarchy to categorize our fair value measurements broken down into three levels based on the transparency of inputs, where Level 1 uses observable prices in active markets and Level 3 uses valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs. Greater use of management judgment is required in determining fair value when inputs are less observable or unobservable in the marketplace, such as when the volume or level of trading activity for a financial instrument has decreased and when certain factors suggest that observed transactions may not be reflective of orderly market transactions. Judgment must be applied in determining the appropriateness of available prices, particularly in assessing whether available data reflects current prices and/or reflects the results of recent market transactions. Prices or quotes are weighed when estimating fair value with greater reliability placed on information from transactions that are considered to be representative of orderly market transactions. 

Fair value is a market-based measure; therefore, when market observable inputs are not available, our judgment is applied to reflect those judgments that a market participant would use in valuing the same asset or liability. The availability of observable inputs can vary for different products. We use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date even in periods of market disruption or illiquidity. The valuation of financial instruments categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy involves the greatest extent of management judgment. (Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023 and Note 6, Fair Value Disclosures in our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on the definitions of fair value, Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 and related valuation techniques.) 
 For information on the composition of our Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased recorded at fair value and the composition of activity of our Level 3 assets and Level 3 liabilities, Refer to Note 6, Fair Value Disclosures in our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Controls Over the Valuation Process for Financial Instruments Our Independent Price Verification Group, independent of the trading function, plays an important role in determining that our financial instruments are appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable. This is particularly important where prices or valuations that require inputs are less observable. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, these control processes include reviews of the pricing model s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by risk management personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks. In addition, recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model. 
 Income Taxes 
 Significant judgment is required in estimating our provision for income taxes. In determining the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments and interpretations about how to apply inherently complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events. In addition, we must make estimates about the amount, timing and geographic mix of future taxable income, which includes various tax planning strategies to utilize tax attributes and deferred tax assets before they expire. 
 We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We are required to consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, and to weigh the evidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required and the amount of such valuation allowance. Generally, greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this assessment, in particular on recent historical operating results.

We also record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and if so, estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset, either of which could be significant to our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Impairment of Equity Method Investments 
 We evaluate equity method investments for impairment when operating losses or other factors may indicate a decrease in value which is other than temporary. We consider a variety of factors including economic conditions nationally and in their geographic areas of operation, adverse changes in the industry in which they operate, declines in business prospects, deterioration in earnings, increasing costs of operations and other relevant factors specific to the investee. Whenever we believe conditions or events indicate that one of these investments might be significantly impaired, we generally obtain from such investee updated cash flow projections and obtain other relevant information related to assessing the overall valuation of the investee. Utilizing this information, we assess whether the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. To the extent an investment is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount, if any, by which the investment s book value exceeds our estimate of the investment s fair value. 
 In the first quarter of 2023, we performed a valuation of our equity method investment in Golden Queen as forecasts of the expected future production of gold and silver from its mine had declined from previous periods. Our estimate of fair value was based on a discounted cash flow analysis, which included management s projections of future Golden Queen cash flows and a discount rate of 11.0 . As a result of this valuation analysis, an impairment loss of 22.1 million was recorded in Other income for the three months ended February 28, 2023. During the three months ended May 31, 2023, we recognized an additional impairment loss of 7.3 million primarily due to further declines in cash flows at Golden Queen. We sold Golden Queen in the fourth quarter of 2023 and recognized a gain of 1.7 million on the sale. 
 Goodwill 
 At August 31, 2024, goodwill of 1.83 billion represents 2.9 of total assets. The nature and accounting for goodwill is discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023 and Note 13, Goodwill and Intangible Assets in our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually, or when circumstances or events make it more likely than not that an impairment occurred. Goodwill is tested by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Our annual goodwill impairment testing date for a substantial portion of our reporting units is August 1 and November 30 for other identified reporting units. The results of our annual tests did not indicate any goodwill impairment. 

We use allocated tangible equity plus allocated goodwill and intangible assets for the carrying amount of each reporting unit. The amount of tangible equity allocated to a reporting unit is based on our cash capital model deployed in managing our businesses, which seeks to approximate the capital a business would require if it were operating independently. For further information on our Cash Capital Policy, refer to the Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources section herein. Intangible assets are allocated to a reporting unit based on either specifically identifying a particular intangible asset as pertaining to a reporting unit or, if shared among reporting units, based on an assessment of the reporting unit s benefit from the intangible asset in order to generate results. 
 Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit requires management judgment and often involves the use of estimates and assumptions that could have a significant effect on whether or not an impairment charge is recorded and the magnitude of such a charge. Estimated fair values for our reporting units utilize market valuation methods that incorporate price-to-earnings and price-to-book multiples of comparable public companies and/or projected cash flows. Under the market valuation approach, the key assumptions are the selected multiples and our internally developed projections of future profitability, growth and return on equity for each reporting unit. The weight assigned to the multiples requires judgment in qualitatively and quantitatively evaluating the size, profitability and the nature of the business activities of the reporting units as compared to the comparable publicly-traded companies. The valuation methodology for our reporting units is sensitive to management s forecasts of future profitability, which are a significant component of the valuation and come with a level of uncertainty regarding trading volumes and capital market transaction levels. In addition, as the fair values determined under the market valuation approach represent a noncontrolling interest, we apply a control premium to arrive at the estimate fair value of each reporting unit on a controlling basis. 
 The carrying values of goodwill by reporting unit at August 31, 2024 are as follows: 701.8 million in Investment Banking, 255.8 million in Equities and Wealth Management, 577.9 million in Fixed Income, 143.0 million in Asset Management and 154.5 million attributed to various individual other investments. 
 
 Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources 
 Our CFO and Global Treasurer are responsible for developing and implementing our liquidity, funding and capital management strategies. These policies are determined by the nature and needs of our day to day business operations, business opportunities, regulatory obligations and liquidity requirements. 
 Our actual levels of capital, total assets and financial leverage are a function of a number of factors, including asset composition, business initiatives and opportunities, regulatory requirements and cost and availability of both long-term and short-term funding. We have historically maintained a balance sheet consisting of a large portion of our total assets in cash and liquid marketable securities. The liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our business. 
 We also own a legacy portfolio of businesses and investments that are reflected as consolidated subsidiaries, equity investments or securities. Over the past several quarters, we completed several critical steps to substantially liquidate our legacy merchant banking portfolio of businesses, including the spin-off of Vitesse Energy in January 2023, the sales of Golden Queen in November 2023, our interests in Foursight in April 2024, and the wholesale operations of OpNet in August 2024. 

August 2024 Form 10-Q 55 

In keeping with our strategy of returning excess liquidity to shareholders, during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, we returned an aggregate of 265.7 million to shareholders primarily in the form of 221.4 million in cash dividends and the repurchases of 1.1 million common shares for a total of 44.3 million at a weighted average price of 40.72 per share in connection with the net share settlement for tax purposes of stock awards under our equity compensation plans. 
 We maintain modest leverage to support our investment grade ratings. The growth of our balance sheet is supported by our equity and we have quantitative metrics in place to monitor leverage and double leverage. Our capital plan is robust, in order to sustain our operating model through stressed conditions. We maintain adequate financial resources to support business activities in both normal and stressed market conditions, including a buffer in excess of our regulatory, or other internal or external, requirements. Our access to funding and liquidity is stable and efficient to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations in normal and stressed market conditions. 
 Our Balance Sheet 
 A business unit level balance sheet and cash capital analysis are prepared and reviewed with senior management on a weekly basis. As a part of this balance sheet review process, capital is allocated to all assets and gross balance sheet limits are adjusted, as necessary. This process ensures that the allocation of capital and costs of capital are incorporated into business decisions. The goals of this process are to protect the firm s platform, enable our businesses to remain competitive, maintain the ability to manage capital proactively and hold businesses accountable for both balance sheet and capital usage. 
 We actively monitor and evaluate our financial condition and the composition of our assets and liabilities. We continually monitor our overall securities inventory, including the inventory turnover rate, which confirms the liquidity of our overall assets. A significant portion of our financial instruments are valued on a daily basis and we monitor and employ balance sheet limits for our various businesses.

Fluctuations in the balance of our repurchase agreements from period to period and intraperiod are dependent on business activity in those periods. Additionally, the fluctuations in the balances of our securities purchased under agreements to resell are influenced in any given period by our clients balances and our clients desires to execute collateralized financing arrangements via the repurchase market or via other financing products. Average balances and period end balances will fluctuate based on market and liquidity conditions and we consider the fluctuations intraperiod to be typical for the repurchase market.

 Liquidity Management 
 The key objectives of the liquidity management framework are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial and idiosyncratic distress. Our liquidity management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to service our financial obligations without material franchise or business impact. 
 The principal elements of our liquidity management framework are our Cash Capital Policy, our assessment of Modeled Liquidity Outflow MLO and our Contingency Funding Plan CFP ). 
 Liquidity Management Framework . Our Liquidity Management Framework is based on a model of a potential liquidity contraction over a one-year time period. This incorporates potential cash outflows during a market or our idiosyncratic liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year and no incremental unsecured debt issuance; 
 Maturity rolloff of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash collateral; 
 Higher margin requirements than currently exist on assets on securities financing activity, including repurchase agreements and other secured funding including central counterparty clearinghouses; 
 Liquidity outflows related to possible credit downgrade; 
 Lower availability of secured funding; 
 Client cash withdrawals; 
 The anticipated funding of outstanding investment and loan commitments; and 
 Certain accrued expenses and other liabilities and fixed costs. 

Cash Capital Policy . We maintain a cash capital model that measures long-term funding sources against requirements. Sources of cash capital include our equity, mezzanine equity and the noncurrent portion of long-term borrowings. Uses of cash capital include the following: 
 Illiquid assets such as equipment, goodwill, net intangible assets, exchange memberships, deferred tax assets and certain investments; 
 A portion of securities inventory and other assets not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment i.e. , margin requirements); and 
 Drawdowns of unfunded commitments. 
 To ensure that we do not need to liquidate inventory in the event of a funding stress, we seek to maintain surplus cash capital. Our total long-term capital of 21.30 billion at August 31, 2024 exceeded our cash capital requirements. 
 MLO. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment. During a liquidity stress, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms e.g. , interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change. As a result of our policy to ensure we have sufficient funds to cover what we estimate may be needed in a liquidity stress, we hold more cash and unencumbered securities and have greater long-term debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require. As part of this estimation process, we calculate an MLO that could be experienced in a liquidity stress. MLO is based on a scenario that includes both a market-wide stress and firm-specific stress, characterized by some or all of the following elements: 
 Global recession, default by a medium-sized sovereign, low consumer and corporate confidence, and general financial instability. 
 Severely challenged market environment with material declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads. 
 Damaging follow-on impacts to financial institutions leading to the failure of a large bank. 
 A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation, executive departure, and/or a ratings downgrade. 
 The following are the critical modeling parameters of the MLO: 
 Liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario. 
 A two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings. 
 No support from government funding facilities. 
 A combination of contractual outflows, such as upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, and contingent outflows e.g ., actions though not contractually required, we may deem necessary in a crisis). We assume that most contingent outflows will occur within the initial days and weeks of a stress. 
 No diversification benefit across liquidity risks. We assume that liquidity risks are additive. 

August 2024 Form 10-Q 57 

The calculation of our MLO under the above stresses and modeling parameters considers the following potential contractual and contingent cash and collateral outflows: 
 All upcoming maturities of unsecured long-term debt, promissory notes and other unsecured funding products assuming we will be unable to issue new unsecured debt or rollover any maturing debt. 
 Repurchases of our outstanding long-term debt in the ordinary course of business as a market maker. 
 A portion of upcoming contractual maturities of secured funding activity due to either the inability to refinance or the ability to refinance only at wider haircuts i.e. , on terms which require us to post additional collateral). Our assumptions reflect, among other factors, the quality of the underlying collateral and counterparty concentration. 
 Collateral postings to counterparties due to adverse changes in the value of our over-the-counter OTC derivatives and other outflows due to trade terminations, collateral substitutions, collateral disputes, collateral calls or termination payments required by a two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings. 
 Variation margin postings required due to adverse changes in the value of our outstanding exchange-traded derivatives and any increase in initial margin and guarantee fund requirements by derivative clearing houses. 
 Liquidity outflows associated with our prime services business, including withdrawals of customer credit balances, and a reduction in customer short positions. 
 Liquidity outflows to clearing banks to ensure timely settlements of cash and securities transactions. 
 Draws on our unfunded commitments considering, among other things, the type of commitment and counterparty. 
 Other upcoming large cash outflows, such as employee compensation, tax and dividend payments, with no expectation of future dividends from any subsidiaries. 
 Based on the sources and uses of liquidity calculated under the MLO scenarios, we determine, based on a calculated surplus or deficit, additional long-term funding that may be needed versus funding through the repurchase financing market and consider any adjustments that may be necessary to our inventory balances and cash holdings. At August 31, 2024, we had sufficient excess liquidity to meet all contingent cash outflows detailed in the MLO for at least 30 days without balance sheet reduction. We regularly refine our model to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. 
 CFP . Our CFP ensures the ability to access adequate liquid financial resources to meet liquidity shortfalls that may arise in emergency situations. The CFP triggers the following actions: 
 Sets out the governance for managing liquidity during a liquidity crisis; 
 Identifies key liquidity and capital early warning indicators that will help guide the response to the liquidity crisis; 
 Identifies the actions and escalation procedures should we experience a liquidity crisis including coordination amongst senior management and the Board of Directors; 
 Sets out the sources of funding available during a liquidity crisis; 

Sets out the communication plan during a liquidity crisis for key external stakeholders including regulators, relationship banks, rating agencies and funding counterparties; and 
 Sets out an action plan to source additional funding. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Financial instruments that are cash and cash equivalents or are deemed by management to be generally readily convertible into cash, marginable or accessible for liquidity purposes within a relatively short period of time:

 Jefferies Financial Group Inc. 

In addition to the cash balances and liquidity pool presented above, the majority of financial instruments (both long and short) in our trading accounts are actively traded and readily marketable. At August 31, 2024, we had the ability to readily obtain repurchase financing for 77.9 of our inventory at haircuts of 10 or less, which reflects the liquidity of our inventory. In addition, as a matter of our policy, all of these assets have internal capital assessed, which is in addition to the funding haircuts provided in the securities finance markets. Additionally, certain of our Financial instruments owned, primarily consisting of loans and investments are predominantly funded by long term capital. Under our cash capital policy, we model capital allocation levels that are more stringent than the haircuts used in the market for secured funding; and we maintain surplus capital at these more stringent levels. We continually assess the liquidity of our inventory based on the level at which we could obtain financing in the marketplace for a given asset. Assets are considered to be liquid if financing can be obtained in the repurchase market or the securities lending market at collateral haircut levels of 10 or less.

 (2) Unencumbered liquid balances represent assets that can be sold or used as collateral for a loan but have not been. 
 In addition to being able to be readily financed at reasonable haircut levels, we estimate that each of the individual securities within each asset class above could be sold into the market and converted into cash within three business days under normal market conditions, assuming that the entire portfolio of a given asset class was not simultaneously liquidated. There are no restrictions on the unencumbered liquid securities, nor have they been pledged as collateral. 
 Sources of Funding and Capital Resources 
 Our assets are funded by equity capital, senior debt, securities loaned, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, customer free credit balances, bank loans and other payables. 

Secured Financing 
 We rely principally on readily available secured funding to finance our inventory of financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold. Our ability to support increases in total assets is largely a function of our ability to obtain short- and intermediate term secured funding, primarily through securities financing transactions. We finance a portion of our long inventory and cover some of our short inventory by pledging and borrowing securities in the form of repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements (collectively, repos ), respectively. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, an average of approximately 61.0 of our cash and noncash repurchase financing activities used collateral that was considered eligible collateral by central clearing corporations. Central clearing corporations are situated between participating members who borrow cash and lend securities (or vice versa); accordingly, repo participants contract with the central clearing corporation and not one another individually. Therefore, counterparty credit risk is borne by the central clearing corporation which mitigates the risk through initial margin demands and variation margin calls from repo participants. The comparatively large proportion of our total repo activity that is eligible for central clearing reflects the high quality and liquid composition of the inventory we carry in our trading books. For those asset classes not eligible for central clearing house financing, we seek to execute our bi-lateral financings on an extended term basis and the tenor of our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements generally exceeds the expected holding period of the assets we are financing. The weighted average maturity of cash and noncash repurchase agreements for non-clearing corporation eligible funded inventory is approximately five months at August 31, 2024. 
 Our ability to finance our inventory via central clearinghouses and bi-lateral arrangements is augmented by our ability to draw bank loans on an uncommitted basis under our various banking arrangements. At August 31, 2024, short-term borrowings, which must be repaid within one year or less include bank loans, overdrafts and borrowings under revolving credit facilities. Letters of credit are used in the normal course of business mostly to satisfy various collateral requirements in favor of exchanges in lieu of depositing cash or securities. Average daily short-term borrowings outstanding were 1.75 billion and 1.44 billion for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively. 
 At August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, our borrowings under bank loans in Short-term borrowings were 1.11 billion and 937.1 million, respectively. Our borrowings include credit facilities that contain certain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a specified level of tangible net worth, require a minimum regulatory net capital requirement for our U.S. broker-dealer, Jefferies LLC, and impose certain restrictions on the future indebtedness of certain of our subsidiaries that are borrowers. Interest is based on rates at spreads over the federal funds rate or other adjusted rates, as defined in the various credit agreements, or at a rate as agreed between the bank and us in reference to the bank s cost of funding. At August 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities. 

August 2024 Form 10-Q 59 

In addition to the above financing arrangements, we issue notes backed by eligible collateral under master repurchase agreements, which provides an additional financing source for our inventory (our repurchase agreement financing program ). The notes issued under this program are presented within Other secured financings. At August 31, 2024, the outstanding notes totaled 1.74 billion, bear interest at a spread over the Secured Overnight Funding Rate SOFR or the Euro Short-Term Rate ESTER and mature from October 2024 to October 2031. 
 Total Long-Term Capital 
 At August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, we had total long-term capital of 21.30 billion and 17.70 billion, respectively, resulting in a long-term debt to equity capital ratio of 1.11:1 and 0.81:1, respectively. See Equity Capital herein for further information on our change in total equity.

Also, the amounts at August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023 exclude 91.5 million and 51.0 million, respectively, of structured notes as the notes mature within one year. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, long-term debt increased by 3.22 billion to 12.92 billion at August 31, 2024, primarily due to proceeds of 3.29 billion from the net issuance of unsecured senior notes, 297.9 million from net issuances of structured notes, 427.9 million from increased subsidiaries borrowings, and valuation losses on structured notes of 105.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a 350.0 million paydown of a revolving credit facility and repayments of 645.0 million on our unsecured senior notes. 
 At August 31, 2024, our unsecured long-term debt has a weighted average maturity of 8.1 years. 
 At August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, our borrowings under several credit facilities classified within Long-term debt in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition amounted to 788.9 million and 735.2 million, respectively. Interest on these credit facilities is based on an adjusted SOFR plus a spread or other adjusted rates, as defined in the various credit agreements. The credit facility agreements contain certain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth and liquidity amounts, certain credit and rating levels and impose certain restrictions on future indebtedness of and require specified levels of regulated capital and cash reserves for certain of our subsidiaries. At August 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under theses credit facilities.

 Access to external financing to finance our day to day operations, as well as the cost of that financing, is dependent upon various factors, including our debt ratings. Our current debt ratings are dependent upon many factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trend and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, our capital structure, our overall risk management, business diversification and our market share and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deterioration in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings. While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact on our business and trading results in future periods is inherently uncertain and depends on a number of factors, including the magnitude of the downgrade, the behavior of individual clients and future mitigating action taken by us. 
 In connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contract arrangements and certain other trading arrangements, we may be required to provide additional collateral to counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a credit rating downgrade. At August 31, 2024, the amount of additional collateral that could be called by counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations under the terms of such agreements in the event of a downgrade of our long-term credit rating below investment grade was 135.2 million. For certain foreign clearing organizations, credit rating is only one of several factors employed in determining collateral that could be called. The above represents management s best estimate for additional collateral to be called in the event of a credit rating downgrade. The impact of additional collateral requirements is considered in our CFP and calculation of MLO, as described above.

Risk Management 
 
 Overview 
 Risk is an inherent part of our business and activities. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our financial soundness, viability and profitability. Accordingly, we have a comprehensive risk management approach, with a formal governance structure and policies and procedures outlining frameworks and processes to identify, assess, monitor and manage risk. Principal risks involved in our business activities include market, credit, liquidity and capital, operational, model and strategic risk. Legal, compliance, new business and reputational risk are also included within our principal risks . 
 Risk management is a multifaceted process that requires communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets. Our risk management process encompasses the active involvement of executive and senior management, and also many departments independent of the revenue-producing business units, including the Risk Management, Operations, Information Technology, Compliance, Legal and Finance Departments. Our risk management policies, procedures and methodologies are flexible in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification. 
 In achieving our strategic business objectives, our risk appetite incorporates keeping our clients interests as top priority and ensuring we are in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, as well as adhering to the highest ethical standards. We undertake prudent risk-taking that protects the capital base and franchise, utilizing risk limits and tolerances that avoid outsized risk-taking. We maintain a diversified business mix and avoid significant concentrations to any sector, product, geography, or activity and set quantitative concentration limits to manage this risk. We consider contagion, second order effects and correlation in our risk assessment process and actively seek out value opportunities of all sizes. We manage the risk of opportunities larger than our approved risk levels through risk sharing and risk distribution, sell-down and hedging as appropriate. We have a limited appetite for illiquid assets and complex derivative financial instruments. We maintain the asset quality of our balance sheet through conducting trading activity in liquid markets and generally ensure high turnover of our inventory. We subject less liquid positions and derivative financial instruments to particular scrutiny and use a wide variety of specific metrics, limits, and constraints to manage these risks. We protect our reputation and franchise, as well as our standing within the market. We operate a federated approach to risk management and assign risk oversight responsibilities to a number of functions with specific areas of focus. 
 For discussion of liquidity and capital risk management, refer to the Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources section herein. 

Governance and Risk Management Structure 
 For a discussion of our governance and risk management structure and our risk management framework, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023. 
 Risk Considerations 
 We apply a comprehensive framework of limits on a variety of key metrics to constrain the risk profile of our business activities. The size of the limits reflects our risk appetite for a certain activity under normal business conditions. Key metrics included in our risk management framework include inventory position and exposure limits on a gross and net basis, scenario analysis and stress tests, Value-at-Risk VaR ), sensitivities, exposure concentrations, aged inventory, Level 3 assets, counterparty exposure, leverage and cash capital. 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk is defined as the risk of loss due to fluctuations in the market value of financial assets and liabilities attributable to changes in market variables. 
 Our market risk principally arises from interest rate risk, from exposure to changes in the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates, and credit spreads, and from equity price risks from exposure to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, equity baskets and equity indices. In addition, commodity price risk results from exposure to the changes in prices and volatilities of individual commodities, commodity baskets and commodity indices, and foreign exchange risk results from changes in foreign currency rates. 
 Market risk is present in our capital markets business through market making, proprietary trading, underwriting and investing activities and is present in our asset management business through investments in separately managed accounts and direct investments in funds. Given our involvement in a broad set of financial products and markets, market risk exposures are diversified, and economic hedges are established as appropriate. 
 Market risk is monitored and managed through a set of key risk metrics such as VaR, stress scenarios, risk sensitivities and position exposures. Limits are set on the key risk metrics to monitor and control the risk exposure ensuring that it is in line with our risk appetite. Our risk appetite, including the market risk limits, is periodically reviewed to reflect business strategy and market environment. Material risk changes, top/emerging risks and limit utilizations/breaches are highlighted, through risk reporting, and escalated as necessary. 
 Trading is principally managed through front office trader mandates, where each trader is provided a specific mandate in line with our product registry. Mandates set out the activities, currencies, countries and products that the desk is permitted to trade in and set the limits applicable to the desk. Traders are responsible for knowing their trading limits and trading in a manner consistent with their mandate. 

August 2024 Form 10-Q 63 

VaR 
 VaR is a statistical estimate of the potential loss from adverse market movements over a specified time horizon within a specified probability (confidence level). It provides a common risk measure across financial instruments, markets and asset classes. We estimate VaR using a model that simulates revenue and loss distributions by applying historical market changes to the current portfolio. We calculate a one-day VaR using a one year look-back period measured at a 95 confidence level.

Our average daily firmwide VaR decreased to 11.35 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 from 13.36 million for the three months ended May 31, 2024. The decrease was driven by a reduction in interest rate and credit spread exposures related to our fixed income business. Our average daily capital markets VaR decreased to 7.29 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 from 8.95 million for the three months ended May 31, 2024, primarily due to a reduction in interest rate and credit spread exposures related to our fixed income business. 
 The efficacy of the VaR model is tested by comparing our actual daily net revenues for those positions included in VaR calculation with the daily VaR estimate. This evaluation is performed at various levels, from the overall level down to specific business lines. For the VaR model, revenue is defined as principal transactions revenues, trading related commissions, revenue from securitization activities and net interest income. VaR backtesting methodologies differ for regulated entities with approved capital models. 
 For a 95 confidence one day VaR model i.e. , no intra-day trading), assuming current changes in market value are consistent with the historical changes used in the calculation, losses would not be expected to exceed the VaR estimates more than twelve times on an annual basis i.e. , once in every 20 days). During the three months ended August 31, 2024, there was one day when the aggregate net trading loss exceeded the 95 one day VaR. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, VaR decreased driven by a reduction in interest rate and credit spread exposures. 
 
 Daily Net Trading Revenue 
 There were seven days with firmwide trading losses out of a total of 63 trading days in the three months ended August 31, 2024. The histogram below presents the distribution of our actual daily net trading revenue for substantially all of our trading activities:

Other Risk Measures 
 The VaR model does not include certain positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity analysis. Risk Management has additional procedures in place to assure that the level of potential loss driven by those positions not in the VaR model arising from market movements are within acceptable levels. Such procedures include performing stress tests and profit and loss analysis. The table below presents the potential reduction in earnings associated with a 10 stress of the fair value of the positions that are not included in the VaR model at August 31, 2024: 
 in thousands 10 Sensitivity Investment in funds (1) 122,076 Private investments 54,069 Corporate debt securities in default 8,336 Trade claims 2,739 
 (1) Includes investments in hedge funds, fund of funds and private equity funds classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and excluded from the fair value hierarchy based on net asset value. 
 The impact of changes in our own credit spreads on our structured notes for which the fair value option was elected is not included in VaR. The estimated credit spread risk sensitivity for each one basis point widening in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was an increase in value of approximately 1.6 million at August 31, 2024, which is included in other comprehensive income. 
 Other Risk 

We are also subject to interest rate risk on our long-term fixed interest rate debt. Generally, the fair market value of debt securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise. The following table represents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates and the related weighted-average interest rate on those maturities for our consolidated long-term debt obligations, inclusive of any related interest rate hedges. For the variable rate borrowings, the weighted-average interest rates are based on the rates in effect at the reporting date. Our market risk with respect to foreign currency exposure on our long-term debt is also presented in the table below.

 Stress Tests and Scenario Analysis 
 Stress tests are used to analyze the potential impact of specific events or extreme market moves on the current portfolio both firm-wide and within business segments. Stress testing is an important part of our risk management approach because it allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, set risk controls and overall assess and mitigate our risk. 
 We employ a range of stress scenarios, which comprise both historical market price and rate changes and hypothetical market environments, and generally involve simultaneous changes of many risk factors. Indicative market changes in the scenarios include, but are not limited to, a large widening of credit spreads, a substantial decline in equities markets, significant moves in selected emerging markets, large moves in interest rates and changes in the shape of the yield curve. 
 Unlike our VaR, which measures potential losses within a given confidence interval, stress scenarios do not have an associated implied probability. Rather, stress testing is used to estimate the potential loss from market moves that tend to be larger than those embedded in the VaR calculation. Stress testing complements VaR to cover for potential limitations of VaR such 

as the breakdown in correlations, non-linear risks, tail risk and extreme events and capturing market moves beyond the confidence levels assumed in the VaR calculations. 
 Stress testing is performed and reported at least weekly as part of our risk management process and on an ad hoc basis in response to market events or concerns. Current stress tests provide estimated revenue and loss of the current portfolio through a range of both historical and hypothetical events. The stress scenarios are reviewed and assessed at least annually so that they remain relevant and up to date with market developments. Additional hypothetical scenarios are also conducted on a sub-portfolio basis to assess the impact of any relevant idiosyncratic stress events as needed. 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a counterparty s credit worthiness or its ability or willingness to meet its financial obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of a financial contract.

 Jefferies Financial Group Inc. 

We are exposed to credit risk as a trading counterparty to other broker-dealers and customers, as a counterparty to derivative contracts, as a direct lender and through extending loan commitments and providing securities-based lending and as a member of exchanges and clearing organizations. Credit exposure exists across a wide range of products, including cash and cash equivalents, loans, securities finance transactions and over-the-counter derivative contracts. The main sources of credit risk are: 
 Loans and lending arising in connection with our investment banking and capital markets activities, which reflects our exposure at risk on a default event with no recovery of loans. Current exposure represents loans that have been drawn by the borrower and lending commitments that are outstanding. In addition, credit exposures on forward settling traded loans are included within our loans and lending exposures for consistency with the balance sheet categorization of these items. Loans and lending also arise in connection with our portion of a Secured Revolving Credit Facility that is with us and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, to be funded equally, to support loan underwritings by Jefferies Finance. For further information on this facility, refer to Note 11, Investments in our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, we have loans outstanding to certain of our officers and employees (none of whom are executive officers or directors). For further information on these employee loans, refer to Note 22, Related Party Transactions in our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Securities and margin financing transactions, which reflect our credit exposure arising from reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements to the extent the fair value of the underlying collateral differs from the contractual agreement amount and from margin provided to customers. 
 OTC derivatives, which are reported net by counterparty when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable master netting agreement. OTC derivative exposure is based on a contract at fair value, net of cash collateral received or posted under credit support agreements. In addition, credit exposures on forward settling trades are included within our derivative credit exposures. 
 Cash and cash equivalents, which includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits at banks. 
 Credit is extended to counterparties in a controlled manner and in order to generate acceptable returns, whether such credit is granted directly or is incidental to a transaction. All extensions of credit are monitored and managed as a whole to limit exposure to loss related to credit risk. Credit risk is managed according to the Credit Risk Management Policy, which sets out the process for identifying counterparty credit risk, establishing counterparty limits, and managing and monitoring credit limits. The policy includes our approach for: 
 Client on-boarding and approving counterparty credit limits; 
 Negotiating, approving and monitoring credit terms in legal and master documentation; 
 Determining the analytical standards and risk parameters for ongoing management and monitoring credit risk books; 

Actively managing daily exposure, exceptions and breaches; and 
 Monitoring daily margin call activity and counterparty performance. 
 Counterparty credit exposure limits are granted within our credit ratings framework, as detailed in the Credit Risk Management Policy. The Credit Risk Department assesses counterparty credit risk and sets credit limits at the counterparty master agreement level. Limits must be approved by appropriate credit officers and initiated in our credit and trading systems before trading commences. All credit exposures are reviewed against approved limits on a daily basis. 
 Our Secured Revolving Credit Facility, which supports loan underwritings by Jefferies Finance, is governed under separate policies other than the Credit Risk Management Policy and is approved by our Board. The loans outstanding to certain of our officers and employees are extended pursuant to a review by our most senior management. 
 Current counterparty credit exposures at August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023 are summarized in the tables below and provided by credit quality, region and industry (in millions). Credit exposures presented take netting and collateral into consideration by counterparty and master agreement. Collateral taken into consideration includes both collateral received as cash as well as collateral received in the form of securities or other arrangements. Current exposure is the loss that would be incurred on a particular set of positions in the event of default by the counterparty, assuming no recovery. Current exposure equals the fair value of the positions less collateral. Issuer risk is the credit risk arising from inventory positions (for example, corporate debt securities and secondary bank loans). Issuer risk is included in our country risk exposure within the following tables.

Country Risk Exposure 
 Country risk is the risk that events or developments that occur in the general environment of a country or countries due to economic, political, social, regulatory, legal or other factors, will affect the ability of obligors of the country to honor their obligations. We define the country of risk as the country of jurisdiction or domicile of the obligor, and monitor country risk resulting from both trading positions and counterparty exposure, which may not include the offsetting benefit of any financial instruments utilized to manage market risk. The following tables reflect our top exposure at August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023 to the sovereign governments, corporations and financial institutions in those non-U.S. countries in which we have a net long issuer and counterparty exposure:

 Operational Risk 
 Operational risk is the risk of financial or non-financial impact, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. We interpret this definition as including not only financial loss or gain but also other negative impacts to our objectives such as reputational impact, legal/regulatory impact and impact on our clients. Third-party risk is also included as a subset of Operational Risk and is defined as the potential threat presented to us, or our employees or clients, from our supply chain and other third parties used to perform a process, service or activity on our behalf. 
 Our Operational Risk framework includes governance as well as operational risk processes, comprises operational risk event capture and analysis, risk and control self-assessments, operational risk key indicators, action tracking, risk monitoring and reporting, deep dive risk assessments, new business approvals and vendor risk management. Each revenue producing and support department is responsible for the management and reporting of operational risks and the implementation of the Operational Risk Management Policy and processes within the department with regular operational risk training provided to our employees. 

Operational Risk events are mapped to Risk Categories used for the consistent classification of risk data to support root cause and trend analysis, which includes: 
 Fraud and Theft 
 Clients and Business Practices 
 Market Conduct / Regulatory Compliance 
 Business Disruption

 Vendor Risk 

August 2024 Form 10-Q 69 

Operational Risk Management Policy, framework, infrastructure, methodology, processes, guidance and oversight of the operational risk processes are centralized and consistent firmwide and additionally subject to regional and legal entity operational risk governance as required. We also maintain a firmwide Third-Party Vendor Risk Management Policy Framework to ensure adequate control and monitoring over our critical third parties which includes processes for conducting periodic reviews covering areas of risk including financial health, information security, privacy, business continuity management, disaster recovery and operational risk. 
 Model Risk 
 Model risk refers to the risk of losses resulting from decisions that are based on the output of models, due to errors or weaknesses in the design and development, implementation, or improper use of models. We use quantitative models primarily to value certain financial assets and liabilities and to monitor and manage our risk. Model risk is a function of the model materiality, frequency of use, complexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions used in a given model. Robust model risk management is a core part of our risk management approach and is overseen through our risk governance structure and risk management controls. 
 Legal and Compliance Risk 
 Legal and compliance risk includes the risk of noncompliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, use of and safekeeping of customer funds, credit granting, collection activities, anti-money laundering and record keeping. These risks also reflect the potential impact that changes in local and international laws and tax statutes have on the economics and viability of current or future transactions. In an effort to mitigate these risks, we continuously review new and pending regulations and legislation and participate in various industry interest groups. We also maintain an anonymous hotline for employees or others to report suspected inappropriate actions by us or by our employees or agents. 
 New Business Risk 
 New business risk refers to the risks of entering into a new line of business or offering a new product. By entering a new line of business or offering a new product, we may face risks that we are unaccustomed to dealing with and may increase the magnitude of the risks we currently face. The New Business Committee reviews proposals for new businesses and new products to determine if we are prepared to handle the additional or increased risks associated with entering into such activities. 
 Reputational Risk 
 We recognize that maintaining our reputation among clients, investors, regulators and the general public is an important aspect of minimizing legal and operational risks. Maintaining our reputation depends on a large number of factors, including the selection of our clients and the conduct of our business activities. We seek to maintain our reputation by screening potential clients and by conducting our business activities in accordance with high ethical standards. Our reputation and business activity can be affected by statements and actions of third parties, even false or misleading statements by them. We actively monitor public comment concerning us and are vigilant in seeking to assure accurate information and perception prevails. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are set forth under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Our Management, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of legal and regulatory liability. In the normal course of business, we have been named as defendants or co-defendants in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages. We are also involved in a number of judicial and regulatory matters, including exams, investigations and similar reviews, arising out of the conduct of our business. Based on currently available information, we do not believe that any matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In July 2024, we commenced litigation against the former portfolio manager of 3 5 2 Capital ABS Master Fund LP (the Fund and a variety of individuals and entities (collectively, the defendants ), alleging that the defendants engaged in a longstanding Ponzi scheme resulting in the misappropriation of approximately 106 million from investors in the Fund and in certain related accounts, including a separately managed account held by the Company. To date, the Company has recognized a loss of 17.2 million. We anticipate that this litigation, which will not be resolved in the near term, will result in the recovery of losses but cannot, with any reliable accuracy, estimate how much we will be able to recover, or the outcome of this litigation, which may lead to additional proceedings. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Information regarding our risk factors appears in Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023. These risk factors describe some of the assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could adversely affect our business or that could otherwise result in changes that differ materially from our expectations. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
