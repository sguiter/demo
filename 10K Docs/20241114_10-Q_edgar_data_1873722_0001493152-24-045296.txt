Going
Concern Matters 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America GAAP ), which contemplates the Company s continuation as a going concern. The Company incurred
a net comprehensive loss of during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and has an accumulated deficit of 
as of September 30, 2024. In addition, current liabilities exceed current assets by as of September 30, 2024. 

Management
intends to raise additional operating funds through equity or debt offerings. However, the management s success is not guaranteed. 

There
are no assurances that the Company will be able to either (1) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations or (2) obtain additional financing through either private placement, public offerings, or bank financing necessary to support
its working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings, or
bank financing are insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional
financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is unavailable
to the Company, it may be required to curtail or cease its operations. 

Due
to uncertainties related to these matters, substantial doubt exists about the company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of
asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern.

The
Company determined our warrant liabilities to be a Level 3 fair value measurement during the year based on management s estimate
of the expected future cash flows required to settle the liabilities and used the Black Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value
as of September 30, 2024. The Black Scholes model requires three basic data inputs: the exercise or strike price, time to expiration,
the risk-free interest rate, the current stock price, the estimated volatility of the stock price in the future, and the dividend rate.
Changes to these inputs could produce a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The fair value of each warrant is estimated
using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

Business
Overview 

Bubblr,
Inc., d/b/a Ethical Web AI is an artificial intelligence AI company that has patent-protected (granted and pending) intellectual
properties. 

The
Company stands at the forefront of a technological revolution committed to remedying the fragmented landscape of the current Internet
through its advanced, ethically focused artificial intelligence software platforms. 

Our
Company embodies integrity and innovation in technology. We aspire to mend the dysfunctional aspects of online experiences while promoting
digital wellness and ethical engagement. 

Mission 

At
Ethical Web AI we are dedicated to fostering a new era of the internet rooted in the principles of ethical engagement, consumer privacy,
and communal prosperity. 

We
endeavor to decentralize profits and authority, channeling control back into the hands of consumers who engage with our technology. This
approach will disrupt traditional power structures in the digital economy, dismantling monopolistic barriers and facilitating an environment
where businesses, irrespective of scale, can compete fairly and collectively thrive. 

Products 

Our
product ecosystem, at the heart of our value proposition, features two trailblazing solutions poised to redefine user interaction within
the digital realm: 

Ethical
Web 

Ethical
Web is our main product. It is the technical manifestation of our first granted patent, US Patent No. 10977387, entitled Internet
Search Mechanism. It is a transformative technology that will profoundly change the internet. 

Very
high-precision searches are executed through anonymous super apps. These high-precision queries include every attribute of the product
or service being searched for, as well as geographical data and availability information. 

A
profoundly different aspect of this new search method is that searches can persist and that search results can be delivered sometime
in the future as they become available. This ability to persist in a search provides a new concierge search capability. 

Consumers
can build and use their super apps as follows: 

Consumers
 retain complete control of their anonymity. They can chat with a potential supplier without giving up any personal information. This
 aspect alone profoundly changes the way suppliers must treat potential customers. 

There
 is no registration process, no identity (email or mobile number) to give up, and no behavioral tracking data recorded. It is an entirely
 safe and secure environment. 

There
 are no advertisements. 

Consumers
 pay a monthly subscription fee rather than a 30 charge on every item they sell. 

Owners
 decide what the apps look like, what prices to charge, and collect the revenue. It is a uniquely decentralized offer. 

The
AI Seek App 

AI
models have shown certain limitations in adaptability, cost-effectiveness, and data contemporaneity. AI Seek, leveraging its strategic
intellectual property assets, is a state-of-the-art generative AI app crafted to transcend these limitations and offer a superior, consumer-friendly
alternative. 

AI
Seek, built on the foundations of our proprietary patents, presents a significant upgrade over existing technologies. Our version stands
out not only in terms of enhanced performance but also in its cost structure, making it more affordable. 

Upholding
our commitment to user privacy, AI Seek operates with complete consumer anonymity. This commitment is reflected in its no-registration
process, absence of cookies, and a staunch policy against behavioral data tracking, setting a new standard for user privacy in the AI
space. 

5 

Another
groundbreaking feature of AI Seek is that each prompt query result is delivered on a unique web page that includes dynamically generated
hypertext links. These hypertext links may include multimedia such as videos and images and text links to other salient web pages, making
it a far superior research tool. 

Though
in its infancy, AI Seek has already begun to generate revenue with a small, dedicated user base of individuals. These early adopters 
continuous engagement and constructive feedback have been instrumental in refining the app s functionalities. 

Conclusion 

These
community super apps are set to redefine internet search and e-commerce, areas that have seen little fundamental change in the past quarter-century.
One of the platform s innovative features is the concierge search, where users can anonymously leave requests for
goods or services that are not immediately available, enabling future transaction fulfillment. 

Furthermore,
Ethical Web AI takes user privacy and control seriously. Our platform ensures user anonymity and places consumers in complete control
of communication channels, transforming the way they interact with online marketplaces. 

Competition 

We
compete with several large companies that include AI in their suite of product offerings. The AI industry also has numerous smaller companies
that compete in the AI space without owning any protected intellectual property and that rely heavily, if not totally, on access to or
linkage to third-party search engines and AI. 

We
face competition from companies with much more significant capital resources than us, and as a result, we could struggle to attract users
and gain market share. Many of our competitors have greater brand name recognition and may be better positioned to adapt to changes in
the industry or the economy as a whole. We will strive to advance our technology in each of these sectors ahead of our competitors to
gain market share. 

We
also face intense competition in employing qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability
to attract, retain, motivate, and compensate new employees. W 

Our
competitors may announce new products, services, or enhancements that better address changing industry standards or users needs,
such as mobile access or a different market focus. Any such increased competition could cause pricing pressure, loss of business, or
decreased user activity, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. 

We
believe that our competitive strengths and protection via our IP are defensible under the umbrella protection of our patents. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
have created a new search mechanism, AN INTERNET-BASED SEARCH MECHANISM, which has been granted a patent in South Africa
(2016/06947), New Zealand (725014), the United States of America Utility Patent No. US 10977387), Canada (2962520), and we have
patents pending on the same processes in Australia (2015248619), the European Union (15723990.6) and the United Kingdom (PCT/GB2015/051130),
creating an alternative economic ecosystem to tackle the current broken model and better serve all main participant groups. This utility
patent defines a profoundly unique way for internet users to search the internet for goods or services rather than text-based search
engine solutions. The technical manifestation of this utility patent is the Ethical Web ATI Open-Source Platform. 

We
have filed a sister patent that is specifically for searching for information rather than goods or services. US Patent Application No.
17/980298 was filed in the USA in November 2022. It is titled Contextual enveloping via dynamically generated hypertext links. 
This utility patent defines a radically unique way for consumers to search for information only, which again is fundamentally different
from traditional search engines. The technical manifestation of this patent is the AI Seek AI LLM (Large Language Model), as it works
exceptionally well with AI LLMs such as Chat GPT 4 and Claude 2. 

6 

We
have also recently filed another patent with the U.S. Patent Office (application number 18/376,101), which currently has a generic title
of computer-implemented method and system. Again, this utility patent resolves a significant issue with existing foundation
AI LLM, such as Chat GPT and Claude 2, whereby they cannot provide information that needs contemporaneous data. This is because the established
AI LLMs have a training data database that was limited to some point in the past. For example, Chat GPT s training data only goes
up to September 2021. Claude 2 will be updating their training data to January 2023. This utility patent uses an internally trained AI
LLM that identifies those search prompts that require contemporaneous data (for example, stock prices and sports data) and augments the
prompt with the necessary contemporaneous data to radically improve AI LLM s output to include references to the required contemporaneous
data. The technical manifestation of this patent is delivered in version 4 and beyond of our AI Seek consumer app. 

Government
Regulation 

We
are subject to many foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business online, many of which are evolving
and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the United States and abroad, laws and regulations relating to the
liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are being tested by many claims, including
actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright, and trademark infringement, and other theories based
on the nature and content of the materials searched, or the content provided by users. Further, some countries impose regulations regarding
or require licenses to conduct various aspects of our business, including employee recruiting and news-related services. Any court ruling
or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services for the activities of their users or other third
parties could harm our business. In addition, rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct, such
as the unauthorized dissemination of national security information, money laundering, or supporting terrorist activities, may in the
future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our website platform, restrict or impose additional
costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon material aspects of our platform. 

In
the area of information security and data protection, we are committed to upholding the highest standards. Most states have enacted laws
and regulations requiring notification to users when there is a security breach of personal data or requiring the adoption of minimum
information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement practically. The costs of compliance with these
laws and regulations may increase in the future due to amendments or changes in interpretation. However, our commitment to data protection
remains unwavering. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities,
which we are actively working to avoid. 

We
are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection. Our privacy policies describe
our practices concerning using, storing, transmitting, and disclosing personal information, including visitor and user data. Any failure
by us to comply with these terms or privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities
or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations and their
application to online services are unclear, evolving, and in a state of flux. For example, in October 2015, the highest court in the
European Union invalidated reliance on the US-EU Safe Harbor regime as one of the legally recognized mechanisms under which the personal
data of European citizens could be transferred to the United States. There is a risk that these laws and regulations may be interpreted
and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and a manner inconsistent with our current
data protection practices or that new laws or regulations will be enacted. In addition, because our platform will be accessible worldwide,
certain foreign governments may claim that we are required to comply with their laws and regulations, including with respect to the storage,
use, and disclosure of user information, even in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees, or infrastructure. Complying
with these varying domestic and international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices.
Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users privacy and data could result in a loss of user confidence in our services
and, ultimately, in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business. 

Employees 

As
of November 14, 2024, we have four full-time employees, not represented by any labor union. 

7 

Legal
Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may become parties to various lawsuits, claims, and other legal proceedings arising in our business s ordinary
course. We are not currently a party, as plaintiff or defendant, to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material or which, individually
or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation if determined
adversely to us. 

Smaller
Reporting Company 

The
Company is a smaller reporting company defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. There are certain exemptions available
to us as a smaller reporting company, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section
404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of
audited financial statements, instead of three years. As long as we maintain our status as a smaller reporting company, 
these exemptions will remain available. 

Implications
of Being an Emerging Growth Company 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act). 

As
an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of reduced or scaled disclosure requirements that otherwise apply to
public companies. These reduced or scaled disclosure requirements include, but are not limited to: 

1. 
 being
 permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management s Discussion
 and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report; 

2. 
 not
 being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended; 

3. 
 being
 able to take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements,
 and registration statements, and 

4. 
 being
 exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden
 parachute payments not previously approved. 

We
elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report and may elect to take advantage of other
reduced reporting requirements in our future filings with the SEC. As a result, the information we provide to our stockholders may be
different from what you might receive from other public reporting companies that are not emerging growth companies. 

The
JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised
accounting standards. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption, and, therefore, we will be subject to the
same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 

Compliance
after Termination of Emerging Growth Company Status 

After
our emerging growth company status is terminated, we cannot take advantage of the reduced or scaled disclosure requirements described
in subparagraphs 1. and 4., above. However, in the event we are a smaller reporting company, as that term is defined in
Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended after our emerging growth company status has terminated, we will still
be able to take advantage of the reduced or scaled disclosure requirements described in subparagraphs 2. and 3., above, for as long as
we continue to have smaller reporting company status.

months ended September 30, 2024, compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues:
 We received our first revenues from operations in July 2023. We will not achieve higher revenues unless we further develop, market,
support, and deliver our products and service offerings. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that we will achieve significant revenues. 

General
and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and costs associated with non-specific
business costs. These include office costs, computer software, and telecoms. The decrease is primarily due to granting stock options
to long-serving executives and new executives in 2023. 

9 

Professional
Fees Professional fees consist of costs related to legal, accounting, and consulting services. The increase in professional
fees was primarily due to expenses to re-audit 2023. 

Sales
and Marketing Sales and marketing costs are explicitly incurred in relation to fees and expenses for investor relations,
advertising, marketing, press releases, and public relations. The decrease in activity in 2004 was due the lack of revenue and funding
in 2024. 

Amortization
and depreciation A sizable portion of the amortization and depreciation costs are related to the amortization of patents
and intellectual property held in the UK subsidiary Bubblr Ltd. 

Research
and Development Costs incurred in developing the Company s platform include those associated with salaries and benefits
for development staff, external contractors, and specialist software for product development. 

Other
Income (expense) The majority of other income and expense is the gain (loss) on the change in fair value of warrant derivative
liability and foreign currency translation gains (loss). 

Gain
(loss) on change in fair value of warrant derivative liability The Company analyzed the warrants issued concerning the Series
C Convertible Preferred Stock (see Note 10) for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. ASC 815 requires
us to assess the fair market value of the derivative liability at the end of each reporting period and recognize any change in the fair
market value as other income or expense items. 

The
average exercise price for warrants determined at issue is 0.32 per share. If the warrants were exercised on September 30, 2024, the
Company would realize a gain due to the difference between the cash received on conversion and the issue cost to the Company of 0.035
per share, the fair value market price of the common stock on September 30, 2024. 

Foreign
currency translation gain (loss): Gains and losses in foreign currency translation are due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and
British pound sterling exchange rates. 

Net
Loss after income tax The net loss after income tax was 533,475 and 1,170,933 for the three months ended September 30,
2024, and 2023, respectively.

 We started to achieve revenue from operations in July 2023. We will not achieve higher revenues unless we develop, market,

General
and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and costs associated with non-specific
business costs. These include, but are not limited to, office costs, computer software, and telecoms. The decrease is primarily due to
granting stock options to long-serving executives and new executives in 2023, offset by accrued compensation and director fees for new
executives hired in the second quarter of 2023. 

Professional
Fees Professional fees consist of costs related to legal, accounting, and consulting. The decrease in professional fees was
primarily due to lower legal fees in 2024, offset by expenses to reaudit the 2023 financial statements. 

Sales
and Marketing Sales and marketing costs are explicitly incurred in relation to fees and expenses for investor relations,
advertising, marketing, press releases, and public relations. The significant decrease in activity was due to a reduction in funding
in 2024. 

Amortization
and depreciation A sizable portion of the amortization and depreciation costs are related to the amortization of patents
and intellectual property held in the UK subsidiary Bubblr Ltd. The increase in 2024 is due to an adjustment to the accumulated amortization
of intellectual property. 

Research
and Development Costs incurred in developing the Company s platform include those associated with development staff
and specialist software for product development.

Current
Assets 

Current
assets consist of cash and other receivables. The decrease in current assets in 2024 was primarily due to the cash receipt of an R D
Credit in 2024. 

Current
Liabilities 

Current
Liabilities consist of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and loans. 

The
 527,651 increase in current liabilities was primarily due to increases in accrued director fees, dividends payable, and salaries, offset
by a decrease in the current portion of related party loans. 

Working
Capital Deficit 

The
working capital deficit increased by 616,979 in the nine months ending on September 30, 2024.

Liquidity 

During
the last two years and through the date of this Report, we have faced an increasingly challenging liquidity situation that has limited
our ability to execute our operating plan. We will need to obtain capital to continue operations, but there is no assurance that we can
secure such funding on acceptable terms. 

As
no significant revenues are generated from our current operations, we will require additional debt or capital to continue operating and
expanding our business. Sources of additional financing or arrangements with third parties may include equity or debt financing, bank
loans, related-party loans, or revolving credit facilities. We may not successfully locate suitable financing transactions in the required
period, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. Unless we can attract additional investment, our operating as a
going concern is in doubt. 

We
voluntarily file annual, quarterly, and current reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act ). In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley and the rules subsequently implemented
by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB have imposed various requirements on public companies,
including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial
compliance costs and to make some activities of ours more time-consuming and costly. We will need capital investment to comply with the
Exchange Act requirements. 

If
we cannot obtain sufficient additional capital, we may have to cease filing our SEC reports and operations altogether. Suppose we get
additional funds by selling any of our equity securities or by issuing common stock to pay current or future obligations. In that case,
the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, and stockholders may experience additional dilution. Equity securities
may have rights, preferences, or privileges that are senior to common stock.

The
Company is currently exploring future fundraising options, including equity, debt, the sale of/or the licensing of the Company s
Patent(s) and IP, with a holdback of the Company s rights to use the IP to secure funding for operations. If we cannot secure additional
financing, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available
to us on acceptable terms or at all. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

This
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). Preparing these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our
estimates are based on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are
described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, we believe that the following accounting
policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas
involving management s judgments and estimates. 

We
believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: 

Foreign
 Currency Translations 

Intangible
 Assets 

Long-lived
 Assets 

Income
 Taxes 

Stock-based
 Compensation 

Common
 Stock Purchase Warrants and Derivative Financial Instruments 

Convertible
 Financial Instruments 

Fair
 Value of Financial Instruments 

Foreign
Currency Translations 

The
functional currency of the Company s international subsidiaries is generally their local currency of Great British Pounds (GBP).
Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and
expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates during the period. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates. The
resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly into accumulated other comprehensive income. 

Intangible
Assets 

The
cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed straight-line
over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology, and other intangibles with contractual terms are generally amortized over
their respective legal or contractual lives. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is
performed, and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted. 

14 

Long-Lived
Assets 

Long-lived
assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on comparing
the undiscounted future cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. The asset is written down to its estimated fair value if an impairment
is indicated. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method per ASC 740, Income Taxes. The asset and liability
method provides that deferred tax bases of assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences
are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more
likely than not to be realized. 

Convertible
Financial Instruments 

The
Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments
if specific criteria are met. These criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded
derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid
instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise
applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate
instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this
rule is when the host instrument is deemed conventional, as that term is described under applicable U.S. GAAP. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company accounts for financial instruments per ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 establishes a
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation per ASC Topic 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation, which prescribes accounting and reporting
standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee and non-employee services are acquired. Share-based payments to
employees and non-employees, including grants of stock options, are recognized as compensation expenses in the financial statements based
on the stock awards fair values on the grant date. That expense is recognized over the period required to provide services in
exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). Stock Options awarded as compensation per
the Company s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan are deemed unissued until vested. Stock Option compensation is recognized as an expense
over the vesting period. Awards forfeited due to unfulfillment of obligations, such as termination of employment before the award is
fully vested, for no cash or other consideration, are not recognized as an expense, and any previously recognized costs are reversed
in the period of forfeiture. 

Common
Stock Purchase Warrants and Derivative Financial Instruments 

Common
stock purchase warrants and other derivative financial instruments are classified as equity if the contracts (1) require physical settlement
or net-share settlement or (2) give the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its shares (physical settlement or net-share
settlement). Contracts which (1) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs
and if that event is outside the control of the Company), (2) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in
shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement), or (3) contain reset provisions that do not qualify for the scope exception are
classified as liabilities. The Company assesses the classification of its common stock purchase warrants and other derivatives at each
reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between equity and liabilities is required.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. However, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
being reported by this Form 10-Q and have concluded that we have material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal control
over financial reporting as described below. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective or sufficient to
accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Management s
Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
chief executive officer and our chief financial officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. An evaluation was performed of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting. The evaluation was based on the framework in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any effectiveness evaluation in future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

16 

Based
on our evaluation under the criteria outlined in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework, our management concluded that as of
September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective because of the identification of material weaknesses
described as follows: 

We
 did not have controls to validate the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used to determine accounting transactions. Accordingly,
 we have a material weakness because there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the interim or annual consolidated
 financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

We
 have limited written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which
 applies to us, requires written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact
 of our failure to have written documentation on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the
 control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

We
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and
 nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the greatest
 extent possible, separate individuals should initiate transactions and record transactions. Management evaluated the impact of our
 failure to segregate duties on our disclosure controls and procedures assessment and concluded that the control deficiency that resulted
 represented a material weakness. 

We
 have insufficient personnel with the requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. 

We
 do not have a functioning audit committee, compensation committee, or an outside independent director on our board of directors.
 This results in ineffective oversight in establishing and monitoring required internal controls and procedures. 

Remediation
Plan to Address the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
Management is committed to improving its internal controls when we have adequate resources. We will appoint independent directors and
establish an audit committee and compensation committee. Due to these material weaknesses, misstatements that could be material to the
annual or interim consolidated financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected during our financial close and
reporting process. 

Our
Company plans to enhance and improve the design of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the period covered by this
quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have been unable to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses,
we plan to implement the following changes: (1) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and
ineffective risk management, and (2) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting, and (#)
appoint an audit committee. The remediation efforts set out are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the
costs of implementing the changes required. Remediation efforts may be materially affected if we do not secure such funds. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially
affected or are reasonably likely to affect our internal control over financial reporting.
