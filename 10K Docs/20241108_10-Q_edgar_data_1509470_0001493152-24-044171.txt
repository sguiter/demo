The
Company s investment objective is to maximize its portfolio s total return, principally by seeking capital gains on its equity
and equity-related investments, and to a lesser extent, income from debt investments. The Company invests principally in the equity securities
of what it believes to be rapidly growing venture capital-backed emerging companies. The Company may invest in these portfolio companies
through direct offerings of the prospective portfolio companies, transactions on secondary marketplaces for private companies, negotiations
with selling stockholders, investment funds, or through special purpose vehicles SPVs and other investment funds for the purpose of investing in securities of a single
private issuer. In addition, the Company may invest in private credit and in founders equity, founders warrants, and private investment
in public equity transactions of special purpose acquisition companies SPACs ). The Company may also invest on an opportunistic
basis in select publicly traded equity securities or certain non-U.S. companies that otherwise meet its investment criteria, subject
to any applicable limitations under the 1940 Act.

Level
2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at
the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level
3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs that reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use
in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and
the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. The majority of the Company s investments are Level 3 investments and are subject
to a high degree of judgment and uncertainty in determining fair value. 

When
the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement
is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For example, a Level
3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3). Therefore, gains and losses
for such assets and liabilities categorized within the Level 3 table set forth in Note 4 Investments at Fair Value 
may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

A
review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may
result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities. Reclassifications impacting Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
are reported as transfers in/out of the Level 3 category as of the beginning of the measurement period in which the reclassifications
occur. Refer to Levelling Policy below for a detailed discussion of the levelling of the Company s financial assets
or liabilities and events that may cause a reclassification within the fair value hierarchy. 

Securities
for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the most recently available closing price of such security
as of the valuation date. If there are legal or contractual restrictions on the sale or use of such security that under ASC 820-10-35,
as modified by ASU 2022-03 (as defined below), should be incorporated into the security s fair value measurement as a characteristic
of the security that would transfer to market participants who would buy the security, the Company will consider those restrictions in
the fair value determination of that security. Contractual sale restrictions on the sale or use of a security which are an entity-specific
characteristic, rather than a security-specific characteristic (as discussed in ASU 2022-03), are not considered in the fair value determinations
for such securities. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments from pricing services, brokers or
dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, the Company determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to GAAP to
determine the fair value of the security. If determined to be adequate, the Company uses the quote obtained. 

Securities
for which reliable market quotations are not readily available or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology,
or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of management, the Company s Board of Directors or the valuation committee
of the Company s Board of Directors (the Valuation Committee ), does not reliably represent fair value, shall each
be valued as follows: 

1. 
 The
 quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the internal investment professionals
 responsible for the portfolio investment; 

2. 
 Preliminary
 valuation estimates are then documented and discussed with senior management; 

3. 
 For
 all investments for which there are no readily available market quotations, the Valuation Committee engages an independent third-party
 valuation firm to conduct independent appraisals, review management s preliminary valuations and make its own independent assessment;

4. 
 The
 Valuation Committee applies the appropriate valuation methodology to each portfolio asset in a consistent manner, considers the inputs
 provided by management and the independent third-party valuation firm, discusses the valuations and recommends to the Company s
 Board of Directors a fair value for each investment in the portfolio; and 

5. 
 The
 Company s Board of Directors then discusses the valuations recommended by the Valuation Committee and determines in good faith
 the fair value of each investment in the portfolio. 

In
making a good faith determination of the fair value of investments, the Board of Directors applies valuation methodologies consistent
with industry practice. Valuation methods utilized include, but are not limited to, the following: comparisons to prices from secondary
market transactions; venture capital financings; public offerings; purchase or sales transactions; analysis of financial ratios and valuation
metrics of portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public; analysis of the portfolio
company s most recent financial statements, forecasts and the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and other relevant
factors. The Company assigns a weighting based upon the relevance of each method to assist the Board of Directors in determining the
fair value of each investment. 

For
investments that are not publicly traded or that do not have readily available market quotations, the Valuation Committee generally engages
an independent valuation firm to provide an independent valuation, which the Company s Board of Directors considers, among other
factors, in making its fair value determinations for these investments. For the current and prior fiscal year, the Valuation Committee
engaged an independent valuation firm to perform valuations of 100 of the Company s investments for which there were no readily
available market quotations. 

Due
to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair
value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these
estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the investments existed,
and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events
that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the realized gains or losses on investments to be different from the net change
in unrealized appreciation or depreciation currently reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Equity
Investments 

Equity
investments for which market quotations are readily available in an active market are generally valued at the most recently available
closing market prices and are classified as Level 1 assets. Equity investments with readily available market quotations that are subject
to sales restrictions due to an initial public offering IPO by the portfolio company will be classified as Level 1. Any
other equity investments with readily available market quotations that are subject to sales restrictions that would transfer to market
participants who would buy the security may be valued at a discount for a lack of marketability DLOM to the most recently
available closing market prices. These investments are generally classified as Level 2 assets. The DLOM used is generally based upon
the market value of publicly traded put options with similar terms. For equity securities with readily available market quotations that
are subject to entity-specific contractual sale restrictions, rather than security-specific contractual sale restrictions, if such entity-specific
contractual sale restrictions first applied or were modified on or after December 15, 2023, the restrictions are not considered in the
determination of fair value for that security. See Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards for more information. 

The
fair values of the Company s equity investments for which market quotations are not readily available are determined based on various
factors and are classified as Level 3 assets. To determine the fair value of a portfolio company for which market quotations are not
readily available, the Board of Directors applies the appropriate respective valuation methodology for the asset class or portfolio holding,
which may involve analyzing the relevant portfolio company s most recently available historical and projected financial results,
public market comparables, and other factors. The Board of Directors may also consider other events, including the transaction in which
the Company acquired its securities, subsequent equity sales by the portfolio company, and mergers or acquisitions affecting the portfolio
company. In addition, the Board of Directors may consider the trends of the portfolio company s basic financial metrics from the
time of its original investment until the measurement date, with material improvement of these metrics indicating a possible increase
in fair value, while material deterioration of these metrics may indicate a possible reduction in fair value.

In
determining the fair value of equity or equity-linked securities (including simple agreement for future equity SAFE notes
and warrants to purchase common or preferred stock) in a portfolio company, the Board of Directors considers the rights, preferences
and limitations of such securities. When equity-linked securities expire worthless, any
cost associated with these positions is recognized as a realized loss on investments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In the event these securities are exercised into common or preferred stock, the
cost associated with these securities is reassigned to the cost basis of the new common or preferred stock. These conversions are noted
as non-cash operating items on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

Debt
Investments 

Given
the nature of the Company s current debt investments (excluding U.S. Treasuries), which are principally convertible and promissory
notes issued by venture capital-backed portfolio companies, these investments are classified as Level 3 assets because there is no known
or accessible market or market indices for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. The Company s debt investments
are valued at estimated fair value as determined in good faith by the Company s Board of Directors. 

Options 

The
Company s Board of Directors determines the fair value of options based on methodologies that can include discounted cash flow
analyses, option pricing models, comparable analyses and other techniques as deemed appropriate. These investments are classified as
Level 3 assets because there is no known or accessible market or market indices for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged.
The Company s options are valued at estimated fair value as determined in good faith by the Company s Board of Directors. 

Special Purpose Vehicles and
Investment Funds 

At various times, the Company may utilize SPVs and similar investment fund
structures in the investment process. The Company advances money to these SPVs or investment funds that are formed for the specific purpose
of investing in securities of a single private issuer. Generally speaking, these single asset SPVs have the following characteristics:
(1) the underlying investment in the securities of the single private issuer is the sole activity of the SPV or investment fund; (2) the
Company s underlying ownership of the single private issuer is proportionate to the Company s contributions made to the SPV
or investment fund; and (3) the Company will receive its proportionate share of the cash proceeds as the single private issuer is monetized
and distributed. The Condensed Consolidated Schedule of Investments presents the value of the Company s investment in the SPV or
investment fund. These SPV and fund investments are valued at estimated fair value as determined in good faith by the Company s
Board of Directors. The SPVs may incur a tax liability associated with distributions made by underlying portfolio investments. If an SPV
or investment fund charges management fees or prepaid partnership expenses, those fees may adjust the cost of the SPV. 

In valuing the
Company s investments in venture investment funds Venture Investment
Funds ), the Company may apply the practical expedient provided by the ASC Topic 820 relating to investments in certain
entities that calculate net asset value NAV per share (or its equivalent). ASC Topic 820 permits an entity holding
investments in certain entities that either are investment companies, or have attributes similar to an investment company, and
calculate NAV per share or its equivalent for which the fair value is not readily determinable, to measure the fair value of such
investments on the basis of that NAV per share, or its equivalent, without adjustment. 

Special
Purpose Acquisition Companies 

The
Company s Board of Directors measures its SPAC sponsor investments at fair value, which is equivalent to cost until a SPAC transaction
is announced. After a SPAC transaction is announced, the Company s Board of Directors will determine the fair value of SPAC investments
based on fair value analyses that can include option pricing models, probability-weighted expected return method analyses and other techniques
as deemed appropriate. Upon completion of the SPAC transaction, the Board of Directors utilizes the public share price of the entity,
less a DLOM if there are security-specific contractual sale restrictions. The Company s SPAC investments are valued at estimated
fair value as determined in good faith by the Company s Board of Directors.

Portfolio
Company Investment Classification 

The
Company is a non-diversified company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The Company classifies its investments by level of control.
As defined in the 1940 Act, control investments are those where the investor retains the power to exercise a controlling influence over
the management or policies of a company. Control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual directly or indirectly owns
beneficially more than 25 of the voting securities of an investee company. Affiliated investments and affiliated companies are defined
by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist when a company or individual directly or indirectly owns, controls or holds the
power to vote 5 or more of the outstanding voting securities of a portfolio company. Refer to the Condensed Consolidated Schedules of
Investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for details regarding the nature and composition of the Company s investment
portfolio. 

Levelling
Policy 

The
portfolio companies in which the Company invests may offer their shares in IPOs. The Company s shares in such portfolio companies
are typically subject to lock-up agreements for 180 days following the IPO. Upon the IPO date, the Company transfers its investment from
Level 3 to Level 1 due to the presence of an active market, or Level 2 if limited by the lock-up agreement. The Company prices the investment
at the closing price on a public exchange as of the measurement date. In situations where there are legal or contractual restrictions
on the sale or use of such security that under ASC 820-10-35 (as modified by ASU 2022-03) should be incorporated into the security s
fair value measurement as a characteristic of the security that would transfer to market participants who would buy the security, the
Company will classify the investment as Level 2 subject to an appropriate DLOM to reflect the restrictions upon sale. The Company transfers
investments between levels based on the fair value at the beginning of the measurement period in accordance with FASB ASC 820. For investments
transferred out of Level 3 due to an IPO, the Company transfers these investments based on their fair value at the IPO date.

Deferred
Financing Costs 

The
Company records fees and expenses incurred in connection with financing or capital raising activities relating to the
Company s shelf registration statement on Form N-2 as deferred financing costs. The Company also incurred additional offering
costs in connection with its Notes due 2026. The Company defers these offering costs until capital is raised pursuant to the
shelf registration statement or as the shelf registration statement expires. For equity capital raised, the offering costs reduce
paid-in capital resulting from the offering. These costs are deferred and amortized using the straight-line method over the
respective life of the financing instrument. For modifications to a financing instrument, any unamortized origination costs are
expensed . 

For debt capital raised, the associated offering costs are deferred and amortized
as part of interest expense using the straight-line method over the life of the debt instrument. As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, the Company had deferred financing costs of and , respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of

Operating
Leases Related Deposits 

The
Company accounts for its operating leases as prescribed by ASC 842, Leases , which requires lessees to recognize a
right-of-use asset on the balance sheet, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a corresponding
lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. The lease expense is presented as a single lease cost that is
amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Non-lease components (maintenance, property tax, insurance and
parking) are not included in the lease cost. On September 1, 2024, the Company extended the previous operating lease for office
space, for an additional term of three years and three months, expiring March 31, 2028 . The Company has
recorded a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for the operating lease obligation. These amounts have been
discounted using the rate implicit in the lease. Refer to Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies Operating
Leases and Related Deposits for further detail. 

Stock-based
Compensation 

Using
the fair value recognition provisions as prescribed by ASC 718, Stock Compensation , stock-based compensation cost is measured
at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the appropriate service period. Determining
the fair value of stock-based awards requires considerable judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options and the
expected volatility of the Company s stock price. Differences between actual results and these estimates could have a material
effect on the Company s financial results. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. Refer to Note 11 Stock-Based
Compensation for further detail.

The
1940 Act prohibits the Company from participating in certain negotiated co-investments with certain affiliates unless it receives an
order from the SEC permitting it to do so. As a BDC, the Company is prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions
with certain of its affiliates without the prior approval of the Board of Directors, including its independent directors, and, in some
cases, the SEC. The affiliates with which the Company may be prohibited from transacting include its officers, directors, and employees
and any person controlling or under common control with the Company, subject to certain exceptions. 

In
the ordinary course of business, the Company may enter into transactions with portfolio companies that may be considered related-party

Significant
Unobservable Inputs for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities 

In
accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , the tables below provide quantitative information about the fair value measurements
of the Company s Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In addition to the techniques and inputs noted
in the tables below, according to the Company s valuation policy, the Board of Directors may also use other valuation techniques
and methodologies when determining the fair value measurements of the Company s assets. The tables below are not intended to be
all-inclusive, but rather provide information on the significant Level 3 inputs as they relate to the fair value measurements of the
Company s assets. To the extent an unobservable input is not reflected in the tables below, such input is deemed insignificant
with respect to the Company s Level 3 fair value measurements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Significant changes
in the inputs in isolation would result in a significant change in the fair value measurement, depending on the input and the materiality
of the investment. Refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies Investments at Fair Value for more
detail.

and determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, to its stockholders. The amount to be paid out as a distribution
is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is based upon the annual earnings estimated by the management of the Company.

As
a RIC, the Company will be subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless the Company makes
distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a timely manner to its stockholders in respect of each calendar
year of an amount at least equal to the sum of 

Depending
on the level of taxable income earned in a taxable year, the Company may choose to carry over taxable income in excess of current taxable
year distributions from such taxable income into the next taxable year and incur a excise tax on such taxable income, as required.
The maximum amount of excess taxable income that may be carried over for distribution in the next taxable year under the Code is the
total amount of distributions paid in the following taxable year, subject to certain declaration and payment guidelines. To the extent
the Company chooses to carry over taxable income into the next taxable year, distributions declared and paid by the Company in a taxable
year may differ from the Company s taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of current
taxable year taxable income, the distribution of prior taxable year taxable income carried over into and distributed in the current taxable
year, or returns of capital. 

The
Company has taxable subsidiaries which hold certain portfolio investments in an effort to limit potential legal liability and/or comply
with source-income type requirements contained in the RIC tax provisions of the Code. These taxable subsidiaries are consolidated for
GAAP and the portfolio investments held by the taxable subsidiaries are included in the Company s condensed consolidated financial
statements and are recorded at fair value. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and
may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and tax assets and liabilities as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments.
Any income generated by these taxable subsidiaries generally would be subject to tax at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable
income. 

The
Company intends to timely distribute to its stockholders substantially all of its annual taxable income for each year, except that it
may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment and, depending upon the level of taxable income earned in a year, may choose to
carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following year and pay any applicable U.S. federal excise tax. 

The
Company is required to include net deferred tax provision/benefit in calculating its total expenses even though these net deferred taxes
are not currently payable/receivable. 

For
U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, a portion of the Taxable Subsidiaries net operating loss carryforwards and basis differences
may be subject to limitations on annual utilization in case of a change in ownership, as defined by federal and state law. The amount
of such limitations, if any, has not been determined. Accordingly, the amount of such tax attributes available to offset future profits
may be significantly less than the actual amounts of the tax attributes. 

The
Company and the Taxable Subsidiaries identified their major tax jurisdictions as U.S. federal, New York, and California and may be subject
to the taxing authorities examination for the tax years 2020 2023 in New York and 2019 2023 in California, respectively.
Further, the Company and the Taxable Subsidiaries accrue all interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as incurred. As

shares of its common stock. In accordance with the exemptive relief
granted to the Company by the SEC on June 16, 2020 with respect to the Amended Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, the Company
is generally authorized to (i) issue restricted shares as part of the compensation package for certain of its employees, officers and
all directors, including non-employee directors (collectively, the Participants ), (ii) issue options to acquire shares
of its common stock Options to certain employees, officers and employee directors as a part of such compensation packages,
(iii) withhold shares of the Company s common stock or purchase shares of common stock from the Participants to satisfy tax withholding
obligations relating to the vesting of restricted shares or the exercise of Options granted to the certain Participants pursuant to the
Amended Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, and (iv) permit the Participants to pay the exercise price of Options granted to them
with shares of the Company s common stock. 

Under
the Amended Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, each non-employee director will receive an annual grant of worth of restricted
shares of common stock (based on the closing stock price of the common stock on the grant date). Each grant of in restricted
shares will vest, in full, if the non-employee director is in continuous service as a director of the Company through the anniversary
of such grant (or, if earlier, the annual meeting of the Company s stockholders that is closest to the anniversary of such grant).

pursuant to the Amended Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. Additionally, on May 31, 2024, restricted shares related to
the 2023 non-employee director grants vested. Compensation expense associated with the restricted shares is recognized on a quarterly
basis over the respective vesting periods. 

Other
than such restricted shares granted to non-employee directors, the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors may
determine the time or times at which Options and restricted shares granted to other Participants will vest or become payable or exercisable,
as applicable. The exercise price of each Option will not be less than 100 of the fair market value of the Company s common stock

exercise price of the incentive stock option is at least 110 of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date
of grant. Generally, no Option will be exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date of grant. In the case of an Option
granted to a 10 Stockholder, the term of an incentive stock option will be for no more than five years from the date of grant.

Forward-Looking
Statements 

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking
statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and
prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, 
 intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, 
 estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, 
and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 

The
forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation,
statements as to: 

our
 future operating results; 

our
 dependence upon our management team and key investment professionals; 

our
 business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 

our
 ability to manage our business and future growth; 

the
 impact of investments that we expect to make; 

risks
 related to investments in growth-stage companies, other venture capital-backed companies,
 and generally U.S. companies; 

our
 contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

our
 ability to make distributions; 

the
 dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries
 in which we invest; 

risks
 related to the uncertainty of the value of our portfolio investments; 

the
 ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

change
 in political, economic or industry conditions; 

our

the
 impact of changes in laws or regulations (including the interpretation thereof), including

the
 adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; 

risks
 related to market volatility, including general price and volume fluctuations in stock markets;
 and 

the
 timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies. 

These
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond
our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking
statements, including, without limitation: 

an
 economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies ability to continue to operate,
 which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies;

 TABLE OF CONTENTS 

an
 economic downturn could disproportionately impact the market sectors in which a significant
 portion of our portfolio is concentrated, causing us to suffer losses in our portfolio; 

a
 contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair
 our investment activities; 

increases
 in inflation or an inflationary economic environment could adversely affect our portfolio
 companies operating results, causing us to suffer losses in our portfolio; 

interest
 rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly because we use leverage
 as part of our investment strategy; and 

the
 risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in the sections entitled Risk Factors 
 in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our annual report on Form 10-K, and in our other filings
 with the SEC. 

Although
we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove
to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions
include our ability to originate new investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital.
In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this quarterly report on Form
10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include
those described or identified in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K in the Risk Factors 
sections. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this quarterly
report on Form 10-Q. The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 

We
are an internally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development
company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ), and has elected to be
treated, and intends to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). 

Our
investment objective is to maximize our portfolio s total return, principally by seeking capital gains on our equity and equity-related
investments, and to a lesser extent, income from debt investments. We invest principally in the equity securities of what we believe
to be rapidly growing venture capital-backed emerging companies. We acquire our investments through direct investments in prospective
portfolio companies, secondary marketplaces for private companies, negotiations with selling stockholders, and through investments in SPVs and investment funds that invest directly in the equity or debt of a single private
issuer. In addition, we may invest
in private credit and in the founders equity, founders warrants, venture capital investment funds, and private investment in public equity PIPE transactions of special purpose acquisition companies SPACs ). We may also invest on an opportunistic
basis in select publicly traded equity securities or certain non-U.S. companies that otherwise meet our investment criteria, subject
to applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. To the extent we make investments in private equity funds and hedge funds that are excluded
from the definition of investment company under the 1940 Act by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, we will limit
such investments to no more than 15 of our net assets. 

In
regard to the regulatory requirements for BDCs under the 1940 Act, some of these investments may not qualify as investments in eligible
portfolio companies, and thus may not be considered qualifying assets. Eligible portfolio companies 
generally include U.S. companies that are not investment companies and that do not have securities listed on a national exchange. If
at any time less than 70 of our gross assets are comprised of qualifying assets, including as a result of an increase in the value of
any non-qualifying assets or decrease in the value of any qualifying assets, we would generally not be permitted to acquire any additional
non-qualifying assets until such time as 70 of our then-current gross assets were comprised of qualifying assets. We would not be required,
however, to dispose of any non-qualifying assets in such circumstances. 

Our
investment philosophy is based on a disciplined approach of identifying promising investments in high-growth, venture-backed
companies across several key industry themes which may include, among others, Software-as-a-Service, Artificial Intelligence,
Consumer Goods Services, Education Technology, Logistics Supply Chain, Financial Technology Services, and SuRo
Sports. Our investment decisions are based on a disciplined analysis of available information regarding each potential portfolio
company s business operations, focusing on the portfolio company s growth potential, the quality of recurring revenues,
and path to profitability, as well as an understanding of key market fundamentals. Venture capital funds or other institutional
investors have invested in the vast majority of companies we evaluate. 

48 

 TABLE OF CONTENTS 

We
seek to deploy capital primarily in the form of non-controlling equity and equity-related investments, including common stock, warrants,
preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company s common equity,
and convertible debt securities with a significant equity component. Typically, our preferred stock investments are non-income producing,
have different voting rights than our common stock investments and are generally convertible into common stock at our discretion. As
our investment strategy is primarily focused on equity positions, our investments generally do not produce current income and therefore
we may be dependent on future capital raising to meet our operating needs if no other source of liquidity is available. 

We
seek to create a low-turnover portfolio that includes investments in companies representing a broad range of investment themes. 

Our
History 

We
formed in 2010 as a Maryland corporation and operate as an internally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company.
Our investment activities are supervised by our Board of Directors and managed by our executive officers and investments professionals,
all of which are our employees. 

Our
date of inception was January 6, 2011, which is the date we commenced development stage activities. We commenced operations as a BDC
upon completion of our IPO in May 2011 and began our investment operations during the second quarter of 2011. 

On
and effective March 12, 2019, our Board of Directors approved our internalization (the Internalization ), and we began operating
as an internally managed non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the
1940 Act. Our Board of Directors approved the Internalization in order to better align the interests of our stockholders with its management.
As an internally managed BDC, we are managed by our employees, rather than the employees of an external investment adviser, thereby allowing
for greater transparency to stockholders through robust disclosure regarding our compensation structure. As a result of the Internalization,
we no longer pay any fees or expenses under an investment advisory agreement or administration agreement, and instead pay the operating
costs associated with employing investment management professionals including, without limitation, compensation expenses related to salaries,
discretionary bonuses and restricted stock grants.

Income 

Investment
income decreased to 888,717 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,465,746 for the three months ended September 30,
2023. The net decrease between periods was primarily due to the cessation of interest income from short-term U.S. Treasury bills,
and from Architect Capital PayJoy SPV, LLC following the redemption of our investment in June 2024. Additional decreases in interest
income were from Xgroup Holdings Limited (d/b/a Xpoint), Shogun Enterprises, Inc. (d/b/a Hearth), and the repayment in full of the
Residential Homes for Rent, LLC (d/b/a Second Avenue) term loan as of December 26, 2023, as well as a decrease in dividend income from
NewLake Capital Partners, Inc. (f/k/a GreenAcreage Real Estate Corp.) following our complete exit in December 2023. The decreases
were offset by an increase in interest income received on cash, and an increase in PIK dividend income from CW Opportunity 2 LP during the three months ended September 30, 2024, relative to the
three months ended ended September 30, 2023.

Group and NewLake Capital Partners, Inc. (f/k/a GreenAcreage Real Estate Corp.) following our complete exit in December 2023. The
decrease was offset by an increase in interest income received on cash and an increase in PIK dividend income from CW Opportunity 2

market purchases, including block purchases, in such manner as will comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act and the Exchange Act.
During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and retired 25.3 million of aggregate principal amount of the 6.00 
Notes due 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the dollar value of 6.00 Notes due 2026 that remained available to be purchased under
the Note Repurchase Program was approximately 9.7 million.

As of November 7, 2024, the aggregate principal dollar amount of 6.00 Notes due 2026 that may yet be repurchased by us under the Note
Repurchase Program is approximately 4.7 million. 

6.50 
Convertible Notes due 2029 

On
August 14, 2024, we issued 25.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.50 Convertible Notes due 2029 to a private purchaser (the Purchaser ), which bear interest at
a rate of 6.50 per year, payable quarterly in arrears on March 30, June 30, September 30, and December 30 of each year, commencing

6.50 Convertible Notes due 2029 mature on August 14, 2029, unless previously repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with
their terms. We do not have the right to redeem the 6.50 Convertible Notes due 2029 prior to August 6, 2027.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS

to Note 10 Debt Capital Activities to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 for
more information regarding the 6.50 Convertible Notes due 2029. 

On
October 9, 2024, we issued and sold 5.0 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 6.50 Convertible Notes due 2029 (the
 Additional Notes ). The Additional Notes are treated as a single series with our initial issuance of 25.0 million in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 6.50 Convertible Notes due 2029 (the Initial Notes and have the same
terms as the Initial Notes. The Additional Notes are fungible and rank equally with the Initial Notes. Upon issuance of the
Additional Notes, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 6.50 Convertible Notes due 2029 became 30.0

Share Repurchase Program

of Directors authorized an extension of the Share Repurchase Program until the earlier of (i) October 31, 2025 or (ii) the repurchase
of 64.3 million in aggregate amount of our common stock. 

The timing and number of shares
to be repurchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions and alternative
investment opportunities. The Share Repurchase Program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason and does not
obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares of its common stock. Under the Share Repurchase Program, we may repurchase our outstanding
common stock in the open market, provided that we comply with the prohibitions under our insider trading policies and procedures and the
applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Exchange Act. 

As of November 7, 2024, the dollar value of shares that remained available
to be purchased under the Share Repurchase Program was approximately 25.0 million. 

Portfolio
Activity 

Please
refer to Note 12 Subsequent Events to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 for
details regarding activity in our investment portfolio from October 1, 2024 through November 7, 2024. 

We
are frequently in negotiations with various private companies with respect to investments in such companies. Investments in private companies
are generally subject to satisfaction of applicable closing conditions. In the case of secondary market transactions, such closing conditions
may include approval of the issuer, waiver or failure to exercise rights of first refusal by the issuer and/or its stockholders and termination
rights by the seller or us. Equity investments made through the secondary market may involve making deposits in escrow accounts until
the applicable closing conditions are satisfied, at which time the escrow accounts will close and such equity investments will be effectuated. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the sales of our investments and the net proceeds from public offerings
of our equity and debt securities, including pursuant to our continuous at-the-market offering of shares of our common stock as discussed
below under Equity Issuances and Debt Capital Activities At-the-Market Offering . In addition, on December 17, 2021,
we issued 75.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00 Notes due December 30, 2026 (the 6.00 Notes due 2026 ), of
which 49.7 million remain outstanding, and on August 14, 2024, we issued 25.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50 Convertible
Notes due August 14, 2029 (the Convertible Notes ), all of which remain outstanding. For additional information, see below
and Note 10 Debt Capital Activities to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024. 

Our
primary uses of cash are to make investments, pay our operating expenses, and make distributions to our stockholders. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating expenses including interest payments on our debt obligations were 13,530,561 and 14,832,577,
respectively.

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash increased to 32,737,114 from 28,178,352 at the beginning of the year. The increase
in cash was primarily due to maturity of our investments in short-term U.S. Treasury bills, the sale or exit of investments, and
other investment income received, offset by the purchase of new investments, repurchase of our common stock pursuant to a modified
 Dutch Auction tender offer (the Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer ), payment of our operating expenses,
and payment of interest on the 6.00 Notes due 2026 and 6.50 Convertible Notes due 2029. For additional information relating to the
Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer, see Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer below and Note 5 - Common
Stock to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as
of September 30, 2024. 

Currently,
we believe we have ample liquidity to support our near-term capital requirements. Consistent with past and current practices, we will
continue to evaluate our overall liquidity position and take proactive steps to maintain the appropriate liquidity position based upon
the current circumstances.

We
intend to focus on making equity-based investments from which we will derive primarily capital gains. As a consequence, we do not anticipate
that we will pay distributions on a quarterly basis or become a predictable distributor of distributions, and we expect that our distributions,
if any, will be much less consistent than the distributions of other BDCs that primarily make debt investments. If there are earnings
or realized capital gains to be distributed, we intend to declare and pay a distribution at least annually. The amount of realized capital
gains available for distribution to stockholders will be impacted by our tax status. 

Our
current intention is to make any future distributions out of assets legally available therefrom in the form of additional shares of our
common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan, except in the case of stockholders who elect to receive dividends and/or long-term
capital gains distributions in cash. Under the dividend reinvestment plan, if a stockholder owns shares of common stock registered in
its own name, the stockholder will have all cash distributions (net of any applicable withholding) automatically reinvested in additional
shares of common stock unless the stockholder opts out of our dividend reinvestment plan by delivering a written notice to our dividend
paying agent prior to the record date of the next dividend or distribution. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless
be treated as received by the U.S. stockholder for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although no cash distribution has been made. As
a result, if a stockholder does not elect to opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan, it will be required to pay applicable federal,
state and local taxes on any reinvested dividends even though such stockholder will not receive a corresponding cash distribution. Stockholders
that hold shares in the name of a broker or financial intermediary should contact the broker or financial intermediary regarding any
election to receive distributions in cash. 

So
long as we qualify and maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes on
any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability
related to income earned by the RIC will represent obligations of our investors and will not be reflected in our condensed consolidated
financial statements. See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies U.S. Federal and State Income Taxes 
and Note 9 Income Taxes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 for more information.
The Taxable Subsidiaries included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are taxable subsidiaries, regardless of whether
we are taxed as a RIC. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expenses as
a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies. Such income tax expenses and deferred taxes, if any, will be reflected in our
condensed consolidated financial statements.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Critical
Accounting Estimates and Policies 

Critical
accounting policies and practices are the policies that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results,
and require management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about
the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These include estimates of the fair value of our Level 3 investments and other
estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. It is likely that changes in these estimates will
occur in the near term. Our estimates are inherently subjective in nature and actual results could differ materially from such estimates.
See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30,
2024 for further detail regarding our critical accounting policies and recently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Market
Risk 

Our
equity investments are primarily in growth companies that in many cases have short operating histories and are generally illiquid. In
addition to the risk that these companies may fail to achieve their objectives, the price we may receive for these companies in private
transactions may be significantly impacted by periods of disruption and instability in the capital markets. While these periods of disruption
generally have little actual impact on the operating results of our equity investments, these events may significantly impact the prices
that market participants will pay for our equity investments in private transactions. This may have a significant impact on the valuation
of our equity investments. 

Valuation
Risk 

Our
investments may not have a readily available market quotation, as such term is defined in Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, and we value
these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors in accordance with our valuation policy. There
is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied
to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the
types of investments we make. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily
available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of
valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments
existed, and it is possible that the difference could be material. In addition, if we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment
in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 

Interest
Rate Risk 

We
are subject to financial market risks, which could include, to the extent we utilize leverage with variable rate structures, changes
in interest rates. As we invest primarily in equity rather than debt instruments, we would not expect fluctuations in interest rates
to directly impact the return on our portfolio investments, although any significant change in market interest rates could potentially
have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the portfolio companies in which we invest.
As of September 30, 2024, all of our debt investments and outstanding borrowings bore fixed rates of interest. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of September 30, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management
necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Furthermore, third parties may seek to impose liability

in regulatory proceedings against us. While the outcome of any future legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty,
