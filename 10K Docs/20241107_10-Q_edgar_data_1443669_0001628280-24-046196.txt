 million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax provision of million and million, respectively. The income tax provision is based on the estimated annual effective tax rate for the year applied to pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was percent compared to percent in the same period of the prior year. The effective tax rate increased by percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a reduction in expenditures that qualify for the research and development credit. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was percent compared to percent in the same period of the prior year. The effective tax rate decreased by percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the prior year one-time tax impact of the foreign currency translation loss from the closure of our Japan business. 
 The effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of percent due to various factors, including operating in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions partially offset by tax credits for which the Company qualifies.

 Overview 
 We are one of the world s largest, fastest and most comprehensive digital manufacturers of custom parts. Our vision is accelerating innovation by revolutionizing manufacturing. Our mission is to empower companies to bring new ideas to market by offering the fastest and most comprehensive digital manufacturing service in the world. We accomplish this by offering a variety of manufacturing capabilities fulfilled through a combination of owned manufacturing factories and a worldwide network of premium manufacturing partners. Our automated quoting and manufacturing systems are highly integrated with our manufacturing and fulfillment systems, which allow us to offer a vast array of manufacturing technologies in a variety of materials across a continuum of lead times and prices. Our technology-enabled digital engineering and manufacturing applications enable us to produce commercial-grade plastic, metal, and liquid silicone rubber parts in as fast as one day. We utilize injection molding, computer numerical control (CNC) machining, 3D printing and sheet metal fabrication to manufacture custom parts for our customers. 
 Our customers conduct nearly all of their business with us over the Internet. We target our products to the millions of product developers and engineers who use three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) software to design products across a diverse range of end-markets, to the procurement and supply chain professionals seeking to easily and efficiently source custom parts, and to a wide variety of customers seeking to purchase custom made parts. We believe our use of advanced technology enables us to offer significant advantages at competitive prices to many customers and is the primary reason we have become a leading supplier of custom parts. 
 We have established our operations in the United States and Europe. Our primary manufacturing product lines currently include Injection Molding, CNC Machining, 3D Printing and Sheet Metal. We continually seek to expand the range of sizes and geometric complexity of the parts we can make with these processes, to extend the variety of materials we are able to support, and to identify additional manufacturing processes to which we can apply our technology or incorporate into our manufacturing network in order to better serve the evolving preferences and needs of our customers. With the addition of the Protolabs Network in 2021, our global network of premium manufacturing partners significantly expands the breadth and depth of our manufacturing capabilities, enabling us to offer customers a wider variety of lead times and pricing options, and an expanded envelope of parts (complexity, size, etc.). 
 
 Key Financial Measures and Trends 
 Revenue 
 Our operations are comprised of two geographic operating segments in the United States and Europe. On May 27, 2022, the Company's board of directors approved a plan for the closure of our manufacturing facility in Japan and announced an intention to cease operations in the region. The Company dissolved its Japan operations in December 2023. Revenue is derived from our Injection Molding, CNC Machining, 3D Printing and Sheet Metal product lines. Injection Molding revenue consists of sales of custom injection molds and injection-molded parts. CNC Machining revenue consists of sales of CNC-machined custom parts. 3D Printing revenue consists of sales of 3D-printed parts. Sheet Metal revenue consists of 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 sales of fabricated sheet metal custom parts. Our revenue is generated from a diverse customer base and our historical and current efforts to increase revenue have been directed at gaining new customers and selling to our existing customer base by increasing marketing and selling activities, including: 
 expanding the breadth and scope of our products by adding more sizes and materials to our offerings; 
 the introduction of our 3D Printing product line through our acquisition of FineLine in 2014 
 expanding 3D Printing to Europe through our acquisition of Alphaform in 2015 
 the introduction of our Sheet Metal product line through our acquisition of Rapid Manufacturing Group, LLC in 2017; 
 continuously improving the usability of our product lines such as our web-centric applications and 
 providing customers with on-demand access to a global network of premium manufacturing partners through our acquisition of Hubs in 2021. 
 Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of raw materials, costs to procure parts through our network of premium manufacturing partners, equipment depreciation, employee compensation including benefits and stock-based compensation, facilities costs and overhead allocations associated with the manufacturing process for molds and customer parts. We expect our personnel-related costs to increase in order to retain and attract top talent and remain competitive in the market. Overall, we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars. 
 We define gross profit as our revenue less our cost of revenue, and we define gross margin as gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross profit and gross margin are affected by many factors, including our mix of revenue by product line, pricing, sales volume, manufacturing costs, the costs associated with increasing production capacity, the mix between domestic and foreign revenue sources, the mix between revenue produced in our internal manufacturing operations and outsourced to our external manufacturing partners, and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses consist of marketing and sales, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Personnel-related costs are the most significant component in each of these categories. 
 Our business strategy is to continue to be a leading online and technology-enabled manufacturer of quick-turn, on-demand injection-molded, CNC-machined, 3D-printed and fabricated sheet metal custom parts for prototyping and low-volume production. In order to achieve our goals, we anticipate continued substantial investments in technology and personnel, resulting in increased operating expenses in the future. 
 Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expense consists primarily of employee compensation, benefits, commissions, stock-based compensation, marketing demand generation costs such as electronic, print and pay-per-click advertising, trade shows and other related overhead. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in the future as we increase the number of marketing and sales professionals and marketing demand generation costs targeted to increase our customer base and grow revenue. 
 Research and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and outside service costs related to the development of new processes and product lines, enhancement of existing product lines, development of software for internal use, maintenance of internally developed software, quality assurance and testing. Costs for internal use software are evaluated by project and capitalized where appropriate under ASC 350-40, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, Internal-Use Software . We expect research and development expense to increase in the future as we seek to enhance our e-commerce interface technology, internal software and supporting business systems, and continue to expand our product lines. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation, benefits, stock-based compensation, professional service fees related to accounting, tax and legal, and other related overhead. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in the future as we continue to grow and expand as a global organization. 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 Closure of Japan business. Closure of Japan business expense is driven by our decision to close the Japan manufacturing facility and exit the Japan market. The expenses consist primarily of professional service costs. 
 Other Income, net 
 Other income, net primarily consists of foreign currency-related gains and losses and interest income on cash balances and investments. Our foreign currency-related gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in underlying foreign currency exchange rates. Our interest income will vary each reporting period depending on our average cash balances during the period, composition of our marketable security portfolio and the current level of interest rates. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes is comprised of federal, state, local and foreign taxes based on pre-tax income. Overall, our effective tax rate for 2024 and beyond may differ from historical effective tax rates due to increases in losses in foreign operations that are not eligible for tax benefits on account of valuation allowances, as well as any future tax law changes that may impact our effective tax rate.

 Revenue by reportable segment and the related changes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (dollars in thousands) of Total Revenue of Total Revenue Revenue: United States 99,571 79.3 103,940 79.5 (4,369) (4.2) Europe 26,048 20.7 26,765 20.5 (717) (2.7) Total revenue 125,619 100.0 130,705 100.0 (5,086) (3.9 
 Our revenue decreased 5.1 million, or 3.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in larger quantity part orders, which were particularly strong in the three months ended September 30, 2023. By reportable segment, revenue in the United States decreased 4.4 million, or 4.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Revenue in Europe decreased 0.7 million, or 2.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Revenue generated from the Protolabs Network was 25.3 million and 22.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. International revenu e was positively impacted by 0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of foreign currency movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the British Pound and Euro relative to the United States Dollar. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we served 22,511 unique customer contacts, which is a decrease of 2.5 from the same period in 2023. Our customer contacts served decreased at a rate less than our decrease in revenue. This was primarily due to our mix of customers served in the quarter as compared to the same period in 2023 and our strategic focus to earn larger orders from our customers as we strive to be their supplier of choice by serving their custom parts needs through the comprehensive offer of our factory and the Protolabs Network.

 Revenue by product line and the related changes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (dollars in thousands) of Total Revenue of Total Revenue Revenue: Injection Molding 46,831 37.3 51,688 39.6 (4,857) (9.4) CNC Machining 53,327 42.4 52,916 40.5 411 0.8 3D Printing 21,437 17.1 21,622 16.5 (185) (0.9) Sheet Metal 3,743 3.0 4,291 3.3 (548) (12.8) Other Revenue 281 0.2 188 0.1 93 49.5 Total Revenue 125,619 100.0 130,705 100.0 (5,086) (3.9) 
 By product line, our revenue decrease was driven by a 9.4 decrease in Injection Molding revenue, a 12.8 decrease in Sheet Metal revenue and a 0.9 decrease in 3D Printing revenue, which was partially offset by a 0.8 increase in CNC Machining revenue and a 49.5 increase in Other Revenue, in each case for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue decreased 3.0 million, or 4.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, while revenue decreased 3.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in the cost of revenue of 3.0 million was primarily driven by lower revenue volumes in our factory business, which resulted in decreases of 1.6 million in raw materials and production costs, and 1.4 million in personnel and related costs as we aligned staffing to order volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The cost reductions in our digital manufacturing factory business were primarily the result of focused management of resources aligned to order volumes, partially supported by increased automation. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Gross profit decreased from 59.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 57.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Gross margin increased from 45.4 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 45.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating Expenses, Other (Loss) Income, net and Provision for Income Taxes 
 Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses increased 0.9 million, or 4.3 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily driven by marketing demand generation costs increases of 0.4 million, other operating cost increases of 0.3 million and increases in personnel and related costs of 0.2 million due to additional headcount, partially offset by lower incentive compensation during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Research and Development. Our research and development expenses decreased 0.3 million, or 3.3 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to decreases in personnel and related costs of 0.9 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation, partially offset by increases of 0.4 million of other operating costs and 0.2 million in professional services . 
 General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses decreased 0.8 million, or 4.7 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the three months ended September 30, 2023 including a 0.5 million reserve for specific receivables deemed to be uncollectible. Also contributing to the decrease during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 were decreases of 0.7 million in operating costs and 0.4 million in intangible amortization expense, partially offset by increases of 0.6 million in personnel and related costs and 0.2 million in professional services and other costs.

Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of 0.5 million in interest income on investments and other income, partially offset by 0.2 million of foreign currency losses. 
 Provision for Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate of 27.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.2 compared to 25.9 for the same period in 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in expenditures that qualify for the research and development credit. Our income tax provision of 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.1 million as compared to our income tax provision of 2.8 million for the same period in 2023.

 Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue decreased 4.8 million, or 2.2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, while revenue increased 0.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue of 4.8 million was driven by reductions in headcount and overtime leading to lower personnel and related costs of 3.8 million primarily in our digital manufacturing factory business during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The cost reductions in our digital manufacturing factory business were the result of focused management of resources aligned to order volumes, partially supported by increased automation. Also contributing to the decrease in cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 were decreases in order volumes fulfilled through our factories as customer orders fulfilled through our network increased. This resulted in a reduction in raw materials and production costs of 1.9 million, which were partially offset by increases in equipment and facility-related costs of 0.9 million. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Gross profit increased from 166.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 171.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Other income (loss), net. We recognized other income, net of 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.3 million compared to other loss, net of 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Provision for Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate of 31.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 11.3 compared to 43.2 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the prior year one-time tax impact of the foreign currency translation loss from the substantial completion on the closure of our Japan business. Our income tax provision of 8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.2 million compared to our income tax provision of 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 60,535 56,046 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (10,683) 9,873 Net cash used in financing activities (46,004) (38,737) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 235 (244) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 4,083 26,938 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Historically, we have primarily financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. We had cash and cash equivalents of 87.9 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.1 million from December 31, 2023. The increase in our cash was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 60.5 million and proceeds from call redemptions and maturities of marketable securities of 15.7 million, which were partially offset by 8.3 million for purchases of property, equipment and other capital assets, 18.1 million for purchases of marketable securities and 46.0 million in repurchases of common stock.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgements and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are disclosed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 As a result of our foreign operations, we have revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. We generate revenue and incur production and sourcing costs and operating expenses in British Pounds and Euros. 
 Our operating results and cash flows are adversely impacted when the United States Dollar appreciates relative to foreign currencies. Additionally, our operating results and cash flows are adversely impacted when the British Pound appreciates relative to the Euro. As we expand internationally, our results of operations and cash flows will become increasingly subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 We have not used forward contracts or currency borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency risk can be assessed by estimating the change in results of operations or financial position resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates. We believe such a change would generally not have a material impact on our financial position, but could have a material impact on our results of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a foreign currency translation loss of 3.9 million in connection with substantially completing our closure of our Japan business. We recognized foreign currency losses of 0.1 million and 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recognized foreign currency losses of 0.4 million and 0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on consolidated revenue of 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a positive impact on consolidated revenue of 1.4 million as for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately and within the time frames specified in the SEC s rules and forms and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
