 The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows (including estimated future expenditures necessary to substantially complete the asset) expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not identify any impairment charges which should be recorded.

 On June 13, 2024, EastGroup entered into amended and restated credit agreements related to its 625,000,000 and 50,000,000 unsecured bank credit facilities, to extend the maturity dates from July 30, 2025 to July 31, 2028. There were no other material changes to the credit facilities, which are outlined below. 
 
 The Company has a unsecured bank credit facility with a group of 10 banks, which has a maturity date of . The credit facility contains options for (at the Company's election) and an additional accordion (with agreement by all parties). The interest rate on each tranche is reset on a monthly basis and as of September 30, 2024, was Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus basis points with an annual facility fee of basis points. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had variable rate borrowings on this unsecured bank credit facility and an interest rate of . The Company has two standby letters of credit totaling pledged on this facility, which reduces borrowing capacity under the credit facility. 
 
 The Company also has a unsecured bank credit facility with a maturity date of , or such later date as designated by the bank; the Company also has available if the extension options in the facility are exercised. The interest rate is reset on a daily basis and as of September 30, 2024, was SOFR plus basis points with an annual facility fee of basis points. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate was with outstanding balance. 
 
 For both facilities, the margin and facility fee are subject to changes in the Company's credit ratings. . 
 
 The facility is also subject to a sustainability-linked pricing component, pursuant to which the applicable interest margin is adjusted if the Company meets a certain sustainability performance target. This sustainability metric is evaluated annually and was achieved for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, which allowed for the interest rate reduction in each of the years subsequent to achieving the metric. The margin was effectively reduced on this unsecured bank credit facility by one basis point, from 77.5 to 76.5 basis points. 
 
 In August 2024, EastGroup repaid a senior unsecured term loan at maturity with an effectively fixed interest rate of .

(14) 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had six interest rate swaps outstanding, all of which are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with unsecured loans. All of the Company s interest rate swaps convert the related loans SOFR rate components to effectively fixed interest rates, and the Company has concluded that each of the hedging relationships is highly effective. 
 
 The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently reclassified into earnings through Interest expense as interest payments are made or received on the Company s variable-rate debt in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The Company estimates that an additional will be reclassified from Other comprehensive income (loss) as a decrease to Interest expense over the next twelve months. 
 
 The Company s valuation methodology for over-the-counter OTC derivatives is to discount cash flows based on SOFR market data. Uncollateralized or partially-collateralized trades include appropriate economic adjustments for funding costs and credit risk. The Company calculates its derivative valuations using mid-market prices.

 Derivative financial agreements expose the Company to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreements. The Company believes it minimizes the credit risk by transacting with financial institutions the Company regards as credit-worthy. 
 
 The Company has an agreement with its derivative counterparties containing a provision stating that the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender. As of September 30, 2024, we had not posted any collateral related to these agreements and were not in breach of any of the provisions of these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions, it would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value.

 In connection with the Current 2023 ATM Program, we may sell shares of our common stock directly through sales agents or through certain financial institutions acting as forward counterparties whereby, at our discretion, the forward counterparties, or their agents or affiliates, may borrow from third parties and subsequently sell shares of our common stock. The use of a forward equity sale agreement allows us to lock in a share price on the sale of shares of our common stock but defer settling and receiving the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date. Additionally, the forward price that we expect to receive upon settlement of an agreement will be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchaser s stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends during the term of the agreement.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the federal securities laws, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that reflect EastGroup Properties Inc. s (the Company or EastGroup expectations and projections about the Company s future results, performance, prospects, plans and opportunities. The Company has attempted to identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as may, will, seek, expects, anticipates, believes, targets, intends, should, estimates, could, continue, assume, projects, goals, plans or variations of such words and similar expressions or the negative of such words, although not all forward-looking statements contain such words. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to the Company and are subject to a number of known and unknown assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Company s actual results, performance, plans or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things, those discussed below. The Company intends for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as applicable by law. The Company does not undertake to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying assumptions or new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. 
 
 The following are some, but not all, of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from those presented in the Company s forward-looking statements (the Company refers to itself as we, us or our in the following): 
 
 international, national, regional and local economic conditions; 
 the competitive environment in which the Company operates; 
 fluctuations of occupancy or rental rates; 
 potential defaults (including bankruptcies or insolvency) on or non-renewal of leases by tenants, or our ability to lease space at current or anticipated rents, particularly in light of the recent inflationary environment; 
 disruption in supply and delivery chains; 
 increased construction and development costs; 
 acquisition and development risks, including failure of such acquisitions and development projects to perform in accordance with our projections or to materialize at all; 
 potential changes in the law or governmental regulations and interpretations of those laws and regulations, including changes in real estate laws, real estate investment trust REIT or corporate income tax laws, potential changes in zoning laws, or increases in real property tax rates, and any related increased cost of compliance; 
 our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT; 
 natural disasters such as fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes; 
 pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the coronavirus pandemic; 
 the availability of financing and capital, increases in interest rates, and our ability to raise equity capital on attractive terms; 
 financing risks, including the risks that our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance our existing debt upon maturity or obtain new financing on attractive terms or at all; 
 our ability to retain our credit agency ratings; 
 our ability to comply with applicable financial covenants; 
 credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to our interest rate swaps; 
 how and when pending forward equity sales may settle; 
 lack of or insufficient amounts of insurance; 
 litigation, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; 
 our ability to attract and retain key personnel; 
 risks related to the failure, inadequacy or interruption of our data security systems and processes, including security breaches through cyber attacks; 
 potentially catastrophic events such as acts of war, civil unrest and terrorism; and 
 -24- 

environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of properties presently owned or previously owned by us. 
 
 The risks included herein are not exhaustive, and investors should be aware that there may be other factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. 
 
 All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors within the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as such factors may be updated from time to time in the Company s periodic filings and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 EastGroup s goal is to maximize shareholder value by being a leading provider in its markets of functional, flexible and quality business distribution space for location-sensitive customers (primarily in the 20,000 to 100,000 square foot range). The Company develops, acquires and operates distribution facilities, the majority of which are clustered around major transportation features in supply constrained submarkets in major Sunbelt regions. The Company s core markets are in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, economic uncertainty and stock market volatility have continued due to a number of factors, including periods of sustained inflation, interest rate uncertainty and geopolitical conflict. While these factors have not had a significant adverse impact on EastGroup to date, they may adversely impact the Company in the future. Most of the Company s leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses, including real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, thereby reducing the Company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation or other factors. Additionally, most of the Company's leases include scheduled rent increases. In the event inflation causes increases in the Company s general and administrative expenses, or higher interest rates increase the Company s cost of doing business, such increased costs would not be passed through to tenants and could adversely affect the Company s results of operations. The Company continues to monitor inflation and interest rates, as well as the uncertainty resulting from the overall economic environment. 
 
 EastGroup believes its current operating cash flow and unsecured bank credit facilities provide the capacity to fund the operations of the Company, and the Company also believes it can issue common and/or preferred equity and obtain debt financing on currently acceptable terms. 
 
 Direct Common Stock Issuance Activity 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EastGroup sold, and subsequently settled the issuance of, 458,679 shares of common stock directly through sales agents under its current at-the-market common stock offering program Current 2023 ATM Program at a weighted average price of 174.43 per share, providing aggregate net proceeds to the Company of 79,210,000. 
 
 Forward Equity Offering Activity 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EastGroup entered into forward equity sale agreements with certain financial institutions acting as forward counterparties under the Current 2023 ATM Program with respect to 1,986,336 shares of common stock with an initial weighted average forward price of 179.46 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common shares by the forward counterparties at the time we entered into forward equity sale agreements. Also during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company settled outstanding forward equity sale agreements that were previously entered into under the Current 2023 ATM Program by issuing 993,214 shares of common stock in exchange for net proceeds of approximately 175,146,000. 
 
 Additionally, on June 13, 2024, the Company amended its unsecured bank credit facilities to extend the maturity date by three years to July 31, 2028. EastGroup s financing and equity issuances are further described in Liquidity and Capital Resources . 
 
 The Company s primary source of revenue is rental income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EastGroup executed new and renewal leases on 6,617,000 square feet (representing 11.6 of the operating portfolio s total square footage of 56,840,000). For new and renewal leases signed during the first nine months of 2024, average rental rates increased by 55.9 as compared to the former leases on the same spaces.

On a diluted per share basis, Net Income Attributable to EastGroup Properties, Inc. Common Stockholders was 3.49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.06 for the same period of 2023, a 14.1 increase. See the Company s analysis of performance trends below for further details. 
 
 Property Net Operating Income PNOI Excluding Income from Lease Terminations from same properties (defined as operating properties owned during the entire period from January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024), increased 5.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 EastGroup s operating portfolio was 96.9 leased and 96.5 occupied as of September 30, 2024, compared to 98.5 and 97.7 , respectively, at September 30, 2023. As of October 23, 2024, the operating portfolio was 96.5 leased and 95.9 occupied. As of September 30, 2024, leases approximating 1.4 of the operating portfolio, based on a percentage of annualized based rent, were scheduled to expire during the remainder of 2024. This percentage was reduced to 1.1 as of October 23, 2024. 
 
 The Company generates new sources of leasing revenue through its acquisitions and also its development and value-add program. The Company mitigates risks associated with development through a Board-approved maximum level of land held for development and by adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EastGroup acquired 34.3 acres of development land in Atlanta for 3,302,000. The Company also began construction of five development projects, containing a total of 783,000 square feet in five markets. EastGroup also transferred six development projects (1,162,000 square feet) in six markets from Development and value-add propertie s to Real estate properties , with costs of 157,567,000 at the date of transfer. As of September 30, 2024, EastGroup s development and value-add program consisted of 17 projects (3,698,000 square feet) located in 12 markets. The projected total investment for the development projects, which were collectively 31.3 leased as of October 23, 2024, is 527,700,000, of which 135,309,000 remained to be invested as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EastGroup acquired operating properties in Austin, Las Vegas and Raleigh, containing 684,000 square feet for 143,585,000. There were no value-add property acquisitions during the period. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EastGroup sold a group of operating properties in the Jackson, Mississippi market, containing 159,000 square feet and 3.9 acres of land in San Francisco, generating gross sales proceeds of 18,050,000. The Company recognized 8,751,000 in Gain on sales of real estate investments and 222,000 in gains on sales of non-operating real estate (included in Other on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company typically initially funds its development and acquisition programs through its 675,000,000 unsecured bank credit facilities (as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources ). As market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, to replace short-term bank borrowings. Moody s Investors Service has assigned the Company s issuer rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. For future debt issuances, the Company intends to issue primarily unsecured fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company may also access the public debt market in the future as a means to raise capital. 
 
 EastGroup has one reportable segment industrial properties, consistent with the Company s manner of internal reporting, measurement of operating results and allocation of the Company s resources. The Company s chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions: (1) funds from operations FFO attributable to common stockholders, and (2) property net operating income PNOI ). 
 
 FFO is computed in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. Nareit ). Nareit s guidance allows preparers an option as it pertains to whether gains or losses on sale, or impairment charges, on real estate assets incidental to a REIT s business are excluded from the calculation of FFO. EastGroup has made the election to exclude activity related to such assets that are incidental to our business. 
 
 FFO is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), excluding gains and losses from sales of real estate property (including other assets incidental to the Company s business) and impairment losses, adjusted for real estate related depreciation and amortization, and 
 -26- 

after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is not considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company s financial performance, nor is it a measure of the Company s liquidity or indicative of funds available to provide for the Company s cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. The Company s key drivers affecting FFO are changes in PNOI (as discussed below), interest rates, the amount of leverage the Company employs and general and administrative expenses. 
 
 PNOI is defined as Income from real estate operations less Expenses from real estate operations (including market-based internal management fee expense) plus the Company s share of income and property operating expenses from its less-than-wholly-owned real estate investments. 
 
 EastGroup sometimes refers to PNOI from Same Properties as Same PNOI the Company also presents Same PNOI Excluding Income from Lease Terminations. Same Properties is defined as operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods. Properties developed or acquired are excluded until held in the operating portfolio for both the current and prior year reporting periods. Properties sold during the current or prior year reporting periods are also excluded. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Same Properties includes properties which were included in the operating portfolio for the entire period from January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. The Company presents Same PNOI and Same PNOI Excluding Income from Lease Terminations as a property-level supplemental measure of performance used to evaluate the performance of the Company s investments in real estate assets and its operating results on a same property basis. 
 
 FFO and PNOI are supplemental industry reporting measurements used to evaluate the performance of the Company s investments in real estate assets and its operating results. The Company believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the calculations of PNOI and FFO provides supplemental indicators of the properties performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. PNOI and FFO as calculated by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other REITs. Investors should be aware that items excluded from or added back to FFO are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company s financial performance. These non-GAAP figures should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to, the Company s financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.

 Income from real estate operations is comprised of rental income, net of reserves of uncollectible rent, expense reimbursement pass-through income and other real estate income including lease termination fees. Expenses from real estate operations is comprised of property taxes, insurance, utilities, repair and maintenance expenses, management fees and other operating costs. Generally, the Company s most significant operating expenses are property taxes and insurance. Tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable, modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable, or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable (gross leases represent only a small portion of the Company s total leases). Increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases. Modified gross leases often include base year amounts, and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable. The Company s exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recovered.

Same property average occupancy represents the average month-end percentage of leased square footage for which the lease term has commenced as compared to the total leasable square footage for the same operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods (January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024). Same property average occupancy was 96.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 97.9 for the same period of 2023. Same property average occupancy was 97.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 98.2 for the same period of 2023. 
 
 The same property average rental rate calculated in accordance with GAAP represents the average annual rental rates of leases in place for the same operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods (January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024). The same property average rental rate was 8.28 and 8.17 per square foot for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 7.79 and 7.69 per square foot for the same periods of 2023. 
 
 Occupancy is the percentage of leased square footage for which the lease term has commenced as compared to the total leasable square footage as of the close of the reporting period. Occupancy at September 30, 2024 was 96.5 . Quarter-end occupancy ranged from 97.1 to 98.2 over the previous four quarters ended September 30, 2023 to June 30, 2024. 
 
 Rental rate change represents the rental rate increase or decrease on new and renewal leases compared to the prior leases on the same space. Rental rate increases on new and renewal leases (4.1 of the operating portfolio s total square footage) averaged 50.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, rental rate increases on new and renewal leases (11.6 of the operating portfolio s total square footage) averaged 55.9 . 
 
 Lease termination fee income is included in Income from real estate operations. Lease termination fee income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,745,000 and 1,957,000, respectively, compared to 221,000 and 532,000 for the same periods of 2023. 
 
 The Company records reserves of uncollectible rent as reductions to Income from real estate operations ; recoveries for uncollectible rent are recorded as additions to Income from real estate operations . The Company recorded net reserves of uncollectible rent of 1,113,000 and 2,534,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 446,000 and 1,201,000 for the same periods of 2023. We evaluate the collectability of rents and other receivables for individual leases at each reporting period based on factors including, among others, tenant payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions and trends in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the geographic area where the property is located. If evaluation of these factors or others indicates it is not probable we will collect substantially all rent, we recognize an adjustment to rental revenue. If our judgment or estimation regarding probability of collection changes we may adjust or record additional rental revenue in the period such conclusion is reached.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We closely monitor our liquidity and capital resources. The Company anticipates that its current cash balance, operating cash flows, borrowings under its unsecured bank credit facilities, proceeds from new debt and/or proceeds from the issuance of equity instruments will be adequate for (i) operating and administrative expenses, (ii) normal repair and maintenance expenses at its properties, (iii) debt service obligations, (iv) maintaining compliance with its debt covenants, (v) distributions to stockholders, (vi) capital improvements, (vii) purchases of properties, (viii) development, and (ix) any other normal business activities of the Company, both in the short-term and long-term. The Company expects liquidity sources and needs in the coming year to be consistent in nature with those for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 As market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, to replace the short-term bank borrowings. The Company believes its current operating cash flow and unsecured bank credit facilities provide the capacity to fund the operations of the Company. The Company also believes it can obtain debt financing and issue common and/or preferred equity. 
 
 For future debt issuances, the Company intends to issue primarily unsecured fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company may also access the public debt or convertible bond markets in the future as a means to raise capital.

 The Company has a 625,000,000 unsecured bank credit facility with a group of 10 banks, which has a maturity date of July 31, 2028. The credit facility contains options for two six-month extensions (at the Company's election) and an additional 625,000,000 accordion (with agreement by all parties). The interest rate on each tranche is reset on a monthly basis and as of September 30, 2024, was SOFR plus 76.5 basis points with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no variable rate borrowings on this unsecured bank credit facility and an interest rate of 5.711 . The Company has two standby letters of credit totaling 2,655,000 pledged on this facility, which reduces borrowing capacity under the credit facility. 
 
 The Company also has a 50,000,000 unsecured bank credit facility with a maturity date of July 31, 2028, or such later date as designated by the bank; the Company also has two six-month extensions available if the extension options in the 625,000,000 facility are exercised. The interest rate is reset on a daily basis and as of September 30, 2024, was SOFR plus 77.5 basis points with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate was 5.835 with no outstanding balance. 
 
 For both facilities, the margin and facility fee are subject to changes in the Company's credit ratings. Although the Company s current credit rating is Baa2, given the strength of the Company s key credit metrics, initial pricing for the credit facilities is based on the BBB+/Baa1 credit ratings level. This favorable pricing level will be retained provided that the Company s consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the applicable agreements, remains less than 32.5 . 
 
 The 625,000,000 facility is also subject to a sustainability-linked pricing component, pursuant to which the applicable interest margin is adjusted if the Company meets a certain sustainability performance target. This sustainability metric is evaluated annually and was achieved for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, which allowed for the interest rate reduction in each of the years subsequent to achieving the metric. The margin was effectively reduced on this unsecured bank credit facility by one basis point, from 77.5 to 76.5 basis points. 
 
 The Company s unsecured bank credit facilities have certain restrictive covenants, such as maintaining minimum debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage, and the Company was in compliance with all of its financial debt covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 
 On October 25, 2023, we established the Current 2023 ATM Program pursuant to which we are able to sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 750,000,000. The Current 2023 ATM Program replaced our previous 750,000,000 ATM program, which was established on December 16, 2022, under which we had sold shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of 464,305,000 through October 25, 2023. 
 
 In connection with the Current 2023 ATM Program, we may sell shares of our common stock through sales agents or through certain financial institutions acting as forward counterparties whereby, at our discretion, the forward counterparties, or their agents or affiliates, may borrow from third parties and subsequently sell shares of our common stock. The use of a forward equity sale agreement allows us to lock in a share price on the sale of shares of our common stock but defer settling and receiving the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date. Additionally, the forward price that we expect to receive upon settlement of an agreement will be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchaser s stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends during the term of the agreement. 
 
 Direct Common Stock Issuance Activity 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EastGroup sold, and subsequently settled the issuance of, 458,679 shares of common stock directly through sales agents under its Current 2023 ATM Program at a weighted average price of 174.43 per share, providing aggregate net proceeds to the Company of 79,210,000. 
 
 Forward Equity Offering Activity 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EastGroup entered into forward equity sale agreements with certain financial institutions acting as forward counterparties under the Current 2023 ATM Program with respect to 1,986,336 shares of common stock with an initial weighted average forward price of 179.46 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common shares by the forward counterparties at the time it entered into forward equity sale agreements. Also during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company settled outstanding forward equity sale agreements that were 
 -38- 

previously entered into under the Current 2023 ATM Program by issuing 993,214 shares of common stock in exchange for net proceeds of approximately 175,146,000. 
 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, EastGroup settled outstanding forward equity sale agreements that were previously entered into under the Current 2023 ATM Program by issuing 299,551 shares of common stock in exchange for net proceeds of approximately 49,385,000. As of October 23, 2024, the Company had 1,099,612 shares of common stock, or approximately 204,306,000 of gross proceeds, available for settlement prior to the applicable settlement period expirations, ranging from August 2025 to September 2025. 
 
 Under the Current 2023 ATM Program, approximately 3,847,000 of common stock remains available to be sold. Future sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, determinations by us of the appropriate sources of funding for us and potential uses of funding available to us. 
 
 EastGroup s other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations, including real estate property obligations, development and value-add obligations and tenant improvements as of December 31, 2023, did not materially change during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The Company s management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the Company. 
 
 Acquisition and Development of Real Estate Properties 
 The FASB Codification provides guidance on how to properly determine the allocation of the purchase price among the individual components of both the tangible and intangible assets based on their respective fair values. Factors considered by management in allocating the cost of the properties acquired include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. The allocation to tangible assets (land, building and improvements) is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models. Land is valued using comparable land sales specific to the applicable market, provided by a third party. The Company determines whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar properties. The cost of the properties acquired may be adjusted based on indebtedness assumed from the seller that is determined to be above or below market rates. 
 
 The purchase price is also allocated among the following categories of intangible assets: the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of leases in-place at the time of acquisition. The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate reflecting the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current market rents over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above and below market lease intangibles are included in Other assets and Other liabilities , respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. In-place lease intangibles are valued based upon management s assessment of factors such as an estimate of foregone rents and avoided leasing costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. These intangible assets are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease. 
 
 The significance of this accounting policy will fluctuate given the transaction activity during the period. 
 
 For properties under development and value-add properties acquired in the development stage, costs associated with development (i.e., land, construction costs, interest expense, property taxes and other costs associated with development) are aggregated into the total capitalized costs of the property. Included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs (primarily personnel costs) deemed related to such development activities. The internal costs are allocated to specific development properties based on development activity. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 See Note 21 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 
 The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its unsecured bank credit facilities and long-term debt maturities. This debt is used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the Company s real estate investment portfolio and operations. The Company s objective for interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. The Company has two variable rate unsecured bank credit facilities as discussed under Liquidity and Capital Resources . As market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, to replace the short-term bank borrowings. The Company s interest rate swaps are discussed in Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The table below presents the principal payments due and weighted average interest rates, which include the impact of interest rate swaps, for both the fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as of September 30, 2024. 
 October December 2024 
 2025 
 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Fair Value Unsecured bank credit facilities variable rate (in thousands) 
 (1) (2) Weighted average interest rate 5.77 (3) 5.77 Unsecured debt fixed rate 
 (in thousands) 
 120,000 145,000 140,000 175,000 160,000 890,000 1,630,000 1,538,223 (4) Weighted average interest rate 3.47 3.13 2.56 2.74 3.10 3.66 3.35 
 
 (1) The variable-rate unsecured bank credit facilities mature in July 2028 and, as of September 30, 2024, have zero drawn on both the 625,000,000 unsecured bank credit facility and the 50,000,000 unsecured bank credit facility. These balances fluctuate based on Company operations and capital activity, as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources . 
 (2) The fair value of the Company s variable rate debt is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at current market rates, excluding the effects of debt issuance costs. 
 (3) Represents the weighted average interest rate for the Company s variable rate unsecured bank credit facilities as of September 30, 2024. 
 (4) The fair value of the Company s fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities, as advised by the Company s bankers, excluding the effects of debt issuance costs. 
 
 As the table above incorporates only those exposures that existed as of September 30, 2024, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. Assuming there was a 100,000,000 balance on the unsecured bank credit facilities, and if interest rates change by 10 or approximately 58 basis points, interest expense and cash flows would increase or decrease by approximately 577,000 annually. This does not include variable-rate debt that has been effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. 
 
 Most of the Company s leases include scheduled rent increases. Additionally, most of the Company s leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses, including real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, thereby reducing the Company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation or other factors. In the event inflation causes increases in the Company s general and administrative expenses or the level of interest rates, such increased costs would not be passed through to tenants and could adversely affect the Company s results of operations. 
 
 EastGroup s financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company s properties are located. The state of the economy or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some of the Company s existing tenants to make lease payments and may therefore increase the reserves of uncollectible rent. It may also impact the Company s ability to (i) renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire, or (ii) lease development space. In addition, an economic downturn or recession could also lead to an increase in overall vacancy rates or a decline in rents the Company can charge to re-lease properties upon expiration of current leases. In all of these cases, EastGroup s cash flows would be adversely affected.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 (i) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 
 The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company s periodic SEC filings. 
 
 (ii) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s third fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION. 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 
 The Company is not presently involved in any material litigation nor, to its knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company or its properties, other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business or which is expected to be covered by the Company s liability insurance. The Company cannot predict the outcome of any litigation with certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the Company, which could materially affect its financial condition or results of operations. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.
