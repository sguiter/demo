shares of common stock, par value per share, and (ii) shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value per share (the Shares of the Company were transferred from Custodian Ventures, LLC to Cardone Ventures, LLC (the Purchaser ). As a result, the Purchaser became an approximately holder of the voting rights of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company on a fully diluted basis of the Company and became the controlling shareholder. The consideration paid for the Shares was . The source of the cash consideration for the Shares was the personal funds of the Purchaser. In connection with the transaction, David Lazar released the Company from all debts owed to him and/or Custodian Ventures, LLC. 

On July 2, 2021, the existing director and officer resigned immediately. Accordingly, David Lazar, serving as a director and an officer, ceased to be the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary, and a Director. At the effective date of the transfer, Brandon Dawson consented to act as the new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary, and a Director of the Company. 

On January 7, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a change to its fiscal year-end from May 31 to December 31. The change in the fiscal year became effective for the Company s 2021 fiscal year, which began June 1, 2021 and ended December 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Company transition report on Form 10-KT for the seven months from June 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021, within the time prescribed by the SEC. 

Brandon Dawson, 54, founded Sonus Corporation in 1996 and served as CEO and Chairman for seven years. He led Sonus through a successful listing on the American Stock Exchange in 1998. He founded Audigy Group in 2004 and remained its CEO and Chairman until July 1, 2021. Audigy Group was acquired by GN Store Nord A/S. He is also the co-founder of Cardone Ventures formed in 2019, a training and consulting company focused on helping small businesses achieve growth. Mr. Dawson also serves as the chairman of the board of Advanced Medical Integration.

and 
cash on hand. 

Because the Company does not expect that existing operational cash flow will be sufficient to fund presently anticipated operations, this raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the Company will need to raise additional funds and is currently exploring alternative sources of financing. Historically, the Company raised capital through private placements, to finance working capital needs and may attempt to raise capital through the sale of common stock or other securities and obtaining some short-term loans. The Company will be required to continue to do so until its operations become profitable. Also, the Company has, in the past, paid for consulting services with its common stock to maximize working capital, and intends to continue this practice where feasible.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements 

This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding management s future plans for the Company, our liquidity and ability to raise capital, our business strategy, and our future operations. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this report, including statements regarding our future financial position, liquidity, working capital sources, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words believe, may, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, should, plan, could, target, potential, is likely, will, expect and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, and financial needs. 

The results anticipated by any or all of these forward-looking statements might not occur. Important factors, uncertainties, and risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic and its negative effect on the U.S. and global economies, and our lack of an operating history and revenue. Further information on the risk factors affecting our business is contained in Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as the result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 

Organizational History of the Company and Overview 

The Company was organized to buy the electric transportation products wholesale from Chinese manufacturers and sell these products via our website. The Company intended to concentrate its first year of operation in Europe, expanding our second year of operation to the North American market. Our main selling product will be the hoverboard. The two-wheeled self-balancing electric scooter is commonly referred to as a hoverboard, which is a type of portable, rechargeable battery-powered scooter. They typically consist of two wheels arranged side-by-side, with two small platforms between the wheels, on which the rider stands. The device is controlled by the rider s feet, standing on the built-in gyroscopic and sensor pads. There is no universally accepted name for the device, as its various product names are attributable to the companies which distribute it and not its manufacturers. Also, the Company intended to resell electric bikes and Segways. 

On December 31, 2020, as a result of a custodianship in Clark County, Nevada, Case Number: A-20-825360-B, Custodian Ventures LLC Custodian was appointed custodian of the Company. 

On December 31, 2020, Custodian appointed David Lazar as the Company s Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. 

On July 2, 2021, as a result of a private transaction, (i) 81,010,654 shares of common stock, par value .001 per share, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 0.001 par value per share (the Shares of the Company were transferred from Custodian Ventures, LLC to Cardone Ventures, LLC (the Purchaser ). As a result, the Purchaser became an approximately 96.7 holder of the voting rights of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company on a fully diluted basis of the Company and became the controlling shareholder. The consideration paid for the Shares was 250,000. The source of the cash consideration for the Shares was the personal funds of the Purchaser. In connection with the transaction, David Lazar released the Company from all debts owed to him and/or Custodian Ventures, LLC. 

9 

On July 2, 2021, the existing director and officer resigned immediately. Accordingly, David Lazar, serving as a director and an officer, ceased to be the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary, and a Director. At the effective date of the transfer, Brandon Dawson consented to act as the new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary, and a Director of the Company. 

The evaluation and selection of a business opportunity is a complex and uncertain process, and we have not yet identified a target operating business for acquisition. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders may be scarce, or we may be unable to obtain the businesses we identify as viable for our objectives, including due to competitive forces in the marketplace beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities for the Company. See Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Plan of Operation 

The Company has no operations from a continuing business other than expenditures related to running the Company as of the date of this Report. We are currently in the process of developing a business plan. Management intends to explore and identify viable business opportunities within the U.S. including seeking to acquire a business in a reverse merger. Our ability to effectively identify, develop and implement a viable plan for our business may be hindered by risks and uncertainties which are beyond our control, including without limitation, the continued negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. and global economies. 

During the remainder of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, we anticipate incurring costs in connection with investigating, evaluating, and negotiating potential business combinations, filing SEC reports, and consummating an acquisition of an operating business. 

Given our limited capital resources, we may consider a business combination with an entity that has recently commenced operations, is a developing company or is otherwise in need of additional funds for the development of new products or services or expansion into new markets, or is an established business experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. Alternatively, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or a merger with, an entity that desires access to the U.S. capital markets. 

Our management anticipates that we will likely only be able to effect one business combination due to our limited capital. This lack of diversification will likely pose a substantial risk in investing in the Company for the indefinite future because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture or operating territory against gains from another. The risks we face will likely be heightened to the extent we acquire a business operating in a single industry or geographical region. 

We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be a complex and risk-prone process. Because of general economic conditions, including unfavorable conditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, rapid technological advances being made in some industries, and shortages of available capital, management believes that there are a number of firms seeking business opportunities at this time at discounted rates with which we will compete. We expect that any potentially available business combinations may appear in a variety of different industries or regions and at various stages of development, all of which will likely render the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complicated. 

Once we have developed and begun to implement our business plan, management intends to fund our working capital requirements through a combination of our existing funds and future issuances of debt or equity securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the implementation of a business plan and commencement of operations. 

10 

Based on our current operations, we do not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months. If we are able to close a reverse merger, it is likely we will need capital as a condition of closing that acquisition. Because of the uncertainties, we cannot be certain as to how much capital we need to raise or the type of securities we will be required to issue. In connection with a reverse merger, we will be required to issue a controlling block of our securities to the target s shareholders which will be very dilutive. 

Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development. Such risks for us include but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model, recognition of revenue sources, and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, develop, implement, and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have -0- cash on hand as of September 30, 2024, and will be dependent upon loans from our new principal shareholder to remain operational. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

We are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on his evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Mr. Brandon Dawson, who is presently serving as our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information relating to our company, required to be disclosed in our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the nine months covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024.
