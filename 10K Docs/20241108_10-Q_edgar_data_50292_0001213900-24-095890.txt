CAUTIONARY NOTE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical
fact may be forward-looking statements. When we use the words anticipates, plans, estimates, 
 expects, believes, should, could, may, will and similar
expressions, we are identifying forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations
and projections about future financial events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations,
business strategy and financial needs. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties described under Risk Factors 
in Part II, Item 1A, and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and as set forth in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on June 14, 2024. Forward-looking statements may include statements related to, among other things: macroeconomic factors, including
inflationary pressures, supply shortages and recessionary pressures; accounting estimates and assumptions; pricing pressures on our products
caused by competition; the risk that our products will not gain market acceptance; our ability to obtain additional financing; our ability
to successfully prevent our registration with the SEC from being suspended or revoked; our ability to operate our accounting systems
effectively; our ability to protect intellectual property; our ability to integrate our satellite facility into our operations; and our
ability to attract and retain key employees. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance and you should not place
undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements,
as they will depend on many factors about which we are unsure, including many factors beyond our control. 

Except as may be required by applicable law, we do not undertake or
intend to update or revise our forward-looking statements, and we assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements contained
in this report as a result of new information or future events or developments. Thus, you should not assume that our silence over time
means that actual events are bearing out as expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. You should carefully review and
consider the various disclosures we make in this report and our other reports filed with the SEC that attempt to advise interested parties
of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our business. 

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from the results and events anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 

changes in the market acceptance
 of our products and services; 

increased levels of competition; 

changes in political, economic
 or regulatory conditions generally and in the markets in which we operate; 

our relationships with
 our key customers; 

adverse conditions in the
 industries in which our customers operate; 

our ability to retain and
 attract senior management and other key employees; 

our ability to quickly
 and effectively respond to new technological developments; 

our ability to protect
 our trade secrets or other proprietary rights, operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and prevent others
 from infringing on our proprietary rights; 

the impact of the U.S. November 2024 presidential
 and congressional elections; and 

other risks, including
 those described in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Financial Overview 

Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination
of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may
be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements
include estimates associated with revenue recognition, valuation of inventories, accounting for income taxes and stock-based compensation
expense. 

Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
are impacted by the accounting policies we have adopted. In order to get a full understanding of our financial statements, one must have
a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed. It is important that the discussion of our operating results that follow be
read in conjunction with these critical accounting policies which have been disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on June 14, 2024.

Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was
 7,341,124, reflecting an increase of 2,530,136, or 52.6 , as compared to 4,810,988 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
The increase in revenue for the period was principally on account of a 60 increase in defense revenues driven principally by recent
and continuing conditions of geopolitical uncertainty. Our quarter over quarter space revenues have increased by 137 , driven principally
by continued investment in commercial space related programs. 

Cost of products sold for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 5,610,080, reflecting an increase of 1,715,657 or 44.1 , as compared to 3,894,423 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The increase in our cost of products sold is attributable to the quarterly increase in revenue, offset in part by the realization
of production efficiencies associated with higher volumes of production. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,371,941 reflecting a decrease of 449,473, or 24.7 , as compared to 1,821,414 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was principally due to a decrease in accounting and consulting fees incurred in connection with
catching up and meeting SEC filing obligations. 

Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 was 185,907, reflecting a decrease of 29,679, or 13.8 , as compared to 215,586 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was principally attributable to reduced amortization in the current period for certain fully amortized assets. 

Total other income for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was income of 73,247, reflecting an increase of 53,415, as compared to income of 19,832 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The increase was attributable to an increase in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. 

Provision for income taxes was 0 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was principally attributable
to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income and the impact of maintaining a full valuation allowance
on the Company s deferred tax assets, net. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable
to the loss before provision for income taxes incurred for the period and the impact of recording a full valuation allowance on the Company s
deferred tax assets, net.

Revenue for the six months ended September 30,
2024 was 14,446,101, reflecting an increase of 4,955,268, or 52.2 , as compared to 9,490,833 for the six months ended September 30,
2023. The increase in revenue for the period was principally on account of a 66 increase in defense revenues as we continue to see strong
orders from defense customers. Space revenues increased 44 driven principally by a robust market for commercial space projects in which
we participate. 

Cost of products sold for the six months ended September
30, 2024 was 10,504,598, reflecting an increase of 2,368,743, or 29.1 , as compared to 8,135,855 for the six months ended September
30, 2023. The increase in our cost of products sold is attributable to the quarterly increase in order volume, offset in part by production
efficiencies achieved with higher levels of production. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six
months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,061,151 reflecting a decrease of 317,832, or 9.4 , as compared to 3,378,983 for the six months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was principally due to a decrease in accounting and consulting fees offset by an increase in marketing
and costs of additional sales personnel. 

Depreciation and amortization for the six months ended September
30, 2024 was 374,177, reflecting a decrease of 56,645, or 13.1 , as compared to 430,822 for the six months ended September 30, 2023.
The decrease was principally attributable to reduced amortization in the current period for certain fully amortized assets while the
company continues to monitor fixed assets investment. 

Total other income for the six months ended September 30,
2024 was income of 133,055, reflecting an increase of 94,733, as compared to income of 38,322 for the six months ended September 30,
2023. The increase was attributable to an increase in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. 

Provision for income taxes was 0 for the six months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023. The provision for income taxes for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was principally attributable
to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income and the impact of maintaining a full valuation allowance
on the Company s deferred tax assets, net. The provision for income taxes for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable
to the loss before provision for income taxes incurred for the period and the impact of recording a full valuation allowance on the Company s
deferred tax assets, net. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources: 

Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working
capital, inventory, capital expenditures, public company costs and general corporate needs. We expect these needs to continue as we further
develop and grow our business. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, our primary sources of liquidity came from existing cash.
Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that existing cash, together with cash generated from operations will
be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements in fiscal year 2025 and into fiscal year 2026, and we are not aware of any
trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in a decrease in liquidity of our assets.
We may require additional capital to respond to technological advancements, competitive dynamics or technologies, business opportunities,
challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and in either the short-term or long-term may determine to engage in equity or debt
financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory
to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly
limited. In particular, inflationary pressures and increased interest rates, and the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the
Middle East have resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption and volatility in the global financial markets, reducing
our ability to access capital. If we are unable to raise additional funds when or on the terms desired, our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

As of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, the Company s
cash and cash equivalents was 8,587,615 and 6,139,823, respectively. The Company has recorded net income of 639,230 and net loss of
 2,416,505 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, the Company
had working capital of 19,279,893 and 18,295,711 and shareholders equity of 22,563,848 and 21,799,518, respectively. 

Our principal source of liquidity has been from cash flows
generated by operating activities and our cash reserves. 

Cash Flow Activities for the Six Months Ended September
30, 2024 Compared to the Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 

The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash

Net cash provided by operating activities was 2,588,997
for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and net cash used in operating activities was 2,259,791 for the six months ended September
30, 2023. The period over period increase in cash provided by operating activities of 4,848,788 was primarily due to the 3,055,735
improvement in net income (loss), 750,465 reduction in inventories, 467,758 reduction in accounts receivable and increase in accounts
payable of 437,974. 

Net cash used in investing activities was 141,205 and 100,695
for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the six
months ended September 30, 2024 was principally due to increases in purchases of property and equipment. 

Backlog of Orders 

The backlog of orders for the Company s products amounted
to approximately 14,298,000 at September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 17,571,000 at September 30, 2023. The orders in backlog
at September 30, 2024 are expected to ship over the next 12 months depending on customer requirements and product availability. 

Inflation 

In the opinion of management, inflation has continued to
impact the costs of our operations and depending upon the current duration and degree of higher inflation levels, is expected to have
an impact upon our operations in the future. Management will continue to monitor inflation and evaluate the possible future effects of
inflation on our business and operations.

 Controls and Procedures 

Management s Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in paragraph (e) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose
in reports that we file or furnish under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
under the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15
under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our
Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer) carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Our principal executive and principal financial officer have concluded based upon the evaluation described above that, as of September
30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal
controls that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
