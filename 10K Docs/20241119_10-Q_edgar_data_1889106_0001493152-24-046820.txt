ACQUISITION CORP 

 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

. The Company was formed for the
purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination
with one or more businesses (the Business Combination ). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for
purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company
is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. 

As
on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activities for the period from September
15, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024, relates to the Company s organizational activities, those necessary to prepare
for and complete the initial public offering IPO ), identifying a target company for a business combination and activities
in connection with the business combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until the completion of its initial
Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds
derived from the IPO. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

The
Company s sponsor is Alphamade Holding LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the Sponsor ). The registration statement
for the Company s IPO was declared effective on December 30, 2022 (the Effective Date ). On January 4, 2023, the Company
consummated the IPO of units (the Units ). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share of the Company, par value
 per share (the Ordinary Shares ), one redeemable warrant (the Warrants and one right (the Rights ),
with each Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon the completion of an initial Business Combination,
subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . On
January 6, 2023, Chardan Capital Markets, LLC exercised its over-allotment option (the Overallotment ), which subsequently
closed on January 9, 2023, to purchase an additional Units at a public offering price of per Unit, generating additional
gross proceeds to the Company of . 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the sale of private units to the Sponsor (the Private Units at a purchase price of per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . Simultaneously with the closing
of the Overallotment, the Company completed the private sale of an additional Private Units, at a purchase price of per
Private Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of . Transaction costs amounted to consisting of
 of underwriting discount, of deferred underwriting commission and of other offering costs. 

Following
the closing of the IPO and the sale of over-allotment units, an aggregate of of the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of
the Private Units (including the Overallotment of the Units and Private Units) were placed in a U.S.-based Trust Account at U.S. Bank
maintained by Equiniti Trust Company, acting as trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set
forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.
Except with respect to income earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay income tax obligations,
the proceeds from the IPO will not be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination or
the Company s liquidation. 

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale
of Private Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business
Combination. The stock exchange listing rules require that the Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or
assets with a fair market value equal to at least of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount
of deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account). The Company will only complete a Business
Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of
the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance
that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. 

The
Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem
all or a portion of their Public Shares either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination
or (ii) by means of a tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder
approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer, will be made by the Company. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to
redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be per Public
Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). The Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded
at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. 

The
Company will not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than (so that it does
not then become subject to The Securities and Exchange Commission s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible
asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to the Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder
approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company receives an ordinary resolution
under Cayman Islands law approving a Business Combination, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who
attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a shareholder vote
is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant
to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information
as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval
in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares
purchased during or after the IPO in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem
their Public Shares, without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against an initial business combination. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant
to the tender offer rules, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder
is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the Public
Shares without the Company s prior written consent. 

The
Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with
the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association
(i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company s initial
business combination or to redeem 100 of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination
Period (as defined below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business
combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval
of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including
interest earned on the Trust account and not previously released to pay taxes, divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public
Shares. 

On
September 27, 2023, the Company extended the time to complete its initial business combination from October 4, 2023 to January 4, 2024
by depositing an aggregate of into the Trust Account. In connection with this extension, on September 26, 2023, the Company
also entered into a non-interest bearing promissory note with the Sponsor for , is payable on the earlier of January 4, 2025
or promptly after the completion of an initial business combination. 

At
an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders held on December 28, 2023 (the Meeting ), the Company adopted the Company s
Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association reflecting the extension of the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from January 4, 2024 (the Termination
Date up to ten (10) times, the first extension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of
one month each (each an Extension up to January 4, 2025 (i.e., for a period of time ending up to 24 months after the consummation
of its Initial Public Offering for a total of twelve (12) months after the Termination Date (assuming a business combination has not
occurred). The Company also entered into an amendment (the Trust Agreement Amendment to the Investment Management Trust
Agreement, dated as of December 30, 2022, with Equiniti Trust Company, LLC (as amended, the Trust Agreement ). Pursuant
to the Trust Agreement Amendment, the Company has extended the date by which it has to complete a business combination from the Termination
Date up to ten (10) times, with the first extension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one
month each from the Termination Date, or extended date, as applicable, to January 4, 2025 by providing five days advance notice
to the trustee prior to the applicable Termination Date, or extended date, and depositing into the Trust Account for each monthly
extension (the Extension Payment until January 4, 2025 (assuming a business combination has not occurred) in exchange
for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note payable upon the consummation of a business combination. 

On
January 4, 2024, the Company deposited into the Trust Account to extend the deadline to complete the business combination from
January 4, 2024 to April 4, 2024. In connection with this extension, on December 28, 2023, the Company entered into a non-interest bearing
promissory note with the Sponsor for , that is payable on the earlier of January 4, 2025 or promptly after the completion of
an initial business combination. Further, the Company has deposited in aggregate into the Trust Account from April to June to
extend the deadline to complete the business combination from April 4, 2024 to July 4, 2024. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, the company
has deposited to extend the timeline for completion of business combination from July 4, 2024 to September 4, 2024. On September
3, 2024, October 2, 2024, and November 4, 2024, the Company entered into monthly extension letters with the sponsors to extend the timeline
of the business combination from September 4, 2024 to October 4, 2024, from October 4, 2024 to November 4, 2024, and from November 4,
2024 to December 4, 2024, respectively. The sponsors had initiated an aggregate of extension fund, including
the September extension, into the trust account. The September extension
fund was deposited into the trust account following September 30, 2024, and as a result, did not accrue interest income during that period.
The September extension payment was not included in the common stock subject to possible redemption figures as of September 30, 2024. 

However,
if the Company has not completed a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except
for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of
the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including
interest earned and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses),
divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the rights of the Public
Shareholders as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining Public Shareholders and its Board of Directors,
liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors
and the requirements of other applicable law. The Sponsor has agreed to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust
Account with respect to the Founder Shares it will receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination
Period. However, if the Sponsor or any of its respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters
have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company
does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and in such event, such amounts will be included with the other
funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution,
it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the IPO price per Unit ). 

In
order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent
any claims by a third party (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce
the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (1) per Public Share and (2) the actual amount per Public Share
held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per Public Share, due to reductions
in the value of trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply to any
claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and as to any claims under the
Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a
third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to
reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all
vendors, service providers (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses
or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim
of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Liquidity 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of and a working capital deficit of . The Company expects that
it will need additional capital to satisfy its liquidity needs beyond the net proceeds from the consummation of the IPO and the proceeds
held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective business combination candidates,
performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with
or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Initial Business Combination. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant professional
costs to remain as a public traded company and to incur transaction costs in pursuit of a Business Combination. In connection with the
Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15,
 Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management believes that these
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company is unable
to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, with the last extension termination date on January 4, 2025, and such
period is not extended, there will be a liquidation and subsequent dissolution. As a result, management has determined that such additional
condition also raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction
costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company s

Risks
and Uncertainties 

Management
is currently evaluating the impact of the risk of bank failures and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the bank
failures could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations, and/or search for a target
company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The unaudited
condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Further, the Company
doesn t have any bank accounts which are associated with failure risk but will keep monitoring any such effects that might impact
the company s financial position. 

On
August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for,
among other things, a new U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and
certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed
on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally
 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise
tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value
of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the
Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the
abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such
extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or
private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new
or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth
company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of
the potential differences in accounting standards used.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

References
to the Company, our, us or we refer to AlphaTime Acquisition Corp. The following
discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited
condensed financial statements and the notes related thereto. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth
below includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements
as a result of many factors. 

We
are a blank check company incorporated on September 15, 2021 inception as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed
for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination
with one or more businesses. We have generated no revenues to date, and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues at
the earliest until we consummate our initial business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and
we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination
target with respect to an initial business combination with us. 

While
we may pursue an acquisition or a business combination target in any business or industry, we intend to focus our search on a rapidly-growing
and large-scaled target, including but not limited to, targets in the following space: fintech, alternative and clean energy, biotech,
logistics, industrial software, artificial intelligence AI and cloud industry, that can benefit from the expertise and
capabilities of our management team. Our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to a particular geographic
region, although we intend to focus on businesses in Asia. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception to September 30, 2024,
have been organizational activities and those necessary to consummate the Initial Public Offering IPO ), described below.
Following our IPO, we will not generate any operating revenues until the completion of our initial business combination. We will generate
non-operating income in the form of interest income after the IPO. We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public
company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 404,367, which consists of loss of 280,163 derived from formation
and operating costs offset by income earned on investment held in Trust Account of 684,530. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 1,232,002, which consists of loss of 915,533 derived from formation
and operating costs offset by income earned on investment held in Trust Account of 2,147,535. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 486,555, which consists of loss of 118,226 derived from formation
and operating costs offset by income earned on Trust Account of 604,781. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 1,712,827 which consists of loss of 466,016 derived from formation
and operating costs offset by income earned on Trust Account of 2,178,843. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
January 4, 2023, we consummated our IPO of 6,000,000 units (the Units ), at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of
 60,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we consummated the sale of 370,500 Private Placement Units at a price of 10.00
per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating total gross proceeds of 3,705,000. 

On
January 6, 2023, and effective January 9, 2023, the underwriters in our IPO purchased an additional 900,000 Units to exercise its over-allotment
option in full at a purchase price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 9,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the
full exercise of the over-allotment option, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 38,700 Private Placement Units, at a purchase
price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of 387,000. Transaction costs amounted to 4,892,699 consisting
of 1,612,500 of underwriting discount, 2,415,000 of deferred underwriting commission and 865,199 of other offering costs.

Following
the closing of our IPO and the sale of over-allotment units, an aggregate of 70,242,000 10.18 per Unit) from the net proceeds and
the sale of the Private Placement Units was held in a Trust Account Trust Account ). As of September 30, 2024, we had marketable
securities held in the Trust Account of 53,347,588 consisting of securities held in a treasury money market fund that invests in United
States government treasury bills, bonds or notes with a maturity of 180 days or less. We intend to use substantially all of the funds
held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing income earned on the Trust Account (less amounts released to us for taxes
payable and deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest and dividend income
to pay taxes, if any. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts
held in the Trust Account. We expect the interest and dividend income earned on the amount in the Trust Account (if any) will be sufficient
to pay our taxes. Through September 30, 2024, we did not withdraw any income earned on the Trust Account to pay our taxes. To the extent
that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds
held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other
acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 1,473 and a working capital deficit of 2,836,334. Until the consummation of our IPO,
our liquidity needs were satisfied through a capital contribution from our Sponsor of 25,000 to purchase the founder shares. As on September
30, 2024, there was an amount of 1,152,500 outstanding as loans against a promissory note issued to the Sponsor for extension of the
period of business combination from October 4, 2023 to September 4, 2024 which was deposited into the Trust Account. On September 3,
2024 and October 2, 2024, respectively, the Company entered into the extension letters with the sponsors to extend the timeline of the
business combination from September 4, 2024 to November 4, 2024. On November 4, 2024, the Company entered into the extension letters
with the sponsors to extend the timeline of the business combination from November 4, 2024 to December 4, 2024. The sponsors had initiated
an aggregate of 165,000 extension fund, including the September extension, into the trust account. Company expects that it will need
additional capital to satisfy its liquidity needs beyond the net proceeds from the consummation of the IPO and the proceeds held outside
of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective business combination candidates, performing
due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire,
and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Initial Business Combination. Although certain of the Company s initial shareholders,
officers and directors or their affiliates have committed to loan the Company funds from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount
they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, there is no guarantee that the Company will receive such funds. 

The
Company will use funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence
on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their
representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate
and complete a business combination. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees
for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a no-shop 
provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies or
investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we
do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a
target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision would be determined based
on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether
as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due
diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination,
our founders or an affiliate of our founders may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial
business combination, we will repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use
a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would
be used for such repayment. Up to 1,152,500 of such loans may be convertible into working capital units, at a price of 10.00 per unit
at the option of the lender. The working capital units would be identical to the private units, each consisting of one ordinary share,
one private warrant and one right with the same exercise price, exercisability and exercise period, subject to similar limited restrictions
as compared to the units sold in our IPO. The terms of such loans by our founders or their affiliates, if any, have not been determined
and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our founders or an
affiliate of our founders as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account, but in the event that we seek loans from any third parties, we will obtain a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

Pursuant
to the extension amendment approved by the shareholders by special resolution at the meeting on December 28, 2023, the Company has adopted
the Company s Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, reflecting the extension of the date by which
the Company must consummate a business combination from January 4, 2024, (the Termination Date up to ten (10) times, with
the first extension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each up to January 4, 2025,
by providing five days advance notice to the trustee prior to the applicable Termination Date, or extended date, and depositing
into the trust account (the Trust Account 55,000 for each monthly extension (the Extension Payment up
to January 4, 2025 (i.e., for a period of time ending up to 24 months after the consummation of its initial public offering) in exchange
for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note payable upon the consummation of a business combination. 

In
connection with the shareholders vote at the meeting on December 28, 2023, 2,160,774 ordinary shares of the Company exercised
their right to redeem such shares (the Redemption for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account. As a
result, approximately 23,302,146 (approximately 10.78 per share) has been removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately
 51,712,221 remained in the Trust Account. Following the redemptions, the Company has 6,873,426 ordinary shares outstanding. 

On
January 5, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement by and among the Company,
HCYC Holding Company PubCo ), ATMC Merger Sub 1 Limited Merger Sub 1 ), ATMC Merger Sub 2 Limited Merger
Sub 2 ), and HCYC Merger Sub Limited Merger Sub 3 , and together with PubCo, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, the Acquisition
Entities ), and HCYC Group Company Limited, Cayman Islands exempted company HCYC ). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction by which (i) the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub 1,
with the Company surviving such merger; (ii) the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 surviving such merger;
and (iii) HCYC will merge with and into Merger Sub 3, with HCYC surviving such merger (collectively, the Mergers ). The
Merger Agreement and the Mergers were unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company and HCYC. The Business Combination
is expected to be consummated after obtaining the required approval by the shareholders of the Company and HCYC and the satisfaction
of certain other customary closing conditions. 

Accordingly,
the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation
of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The unaudited condensed financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Further, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. Management
plans to address this uncertainty during the period leading up to the Initial Business Combination. The Company cannot provide any assurance
that its plans to raise capital or to consummate an Initial Business Combination will be successful. Based on the foregoing, management
believes that the Company lacks the financial resources it needs to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time. Moreover, management s
plans to consummate the initial business combination may not be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The
net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units held in the Trust Account are invested in U.S. government treasury
securities with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated
material exposure to interest rate risk.

Related
Party Transactions 

On
September 28, 2021, our Sponsor received 1,437,500 of the Company s Class B ordinary shares in exchange for 25,000 paid for deferred
offering costs borne by our Sponsor. 

On
January 8, 2022, the board of directors of the Company and our Sponsor, as sole shareholder of the Company, approved, through a special
resolution, the following share capital changes: 

(a) 
 Each
 of the authorized but unissued 200,000,000 Class A ordinary shares were cancelled and re-designated as ordinary shares of 0.0001
 par value each; 

(b) 
 Each
 of the 1,437,500 Class B ordinary shares in issue were repurchased in consideration for the issuance of 1,437,500 ordinary shares
 of 0.0001 par value each; and 

(c) 
 Upon
 completion of the above steps, the authorized but unissued 20,000,000 Class B ordinary shares were cancelled. 

On
January 8, 2022, the Company issued an additional 287,500 ordinary shares to our Sponsor for no additional consideration, resulting in
our Sponsor holding an aggregate of 1,725,000 ordinary shares (the founder shares). The issuance was considered as a bonus share issuance,
in substance a recapitalization transaction, which was recorded and presented retroactively. The founder shares include an aggregate
of up to 225,000 ordinary shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment is not exercised in
full or in part. 

Prior
to the initial investment in the Company of 25,000 by our Sponsor, the Company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The number of
founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20 of the outstanding shares
upon completion of the IPO (excluding the private shares and shares underlying the UPO). The per share purchase price of the founder
shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the Company by the aggregate number of founder shares issued. 

Our
founders and advisors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our founders, advisors or our or their affiliates
and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. 

On
September 30, 2021, our sponsor agreed to loan us up to 300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the IPO. This loan is non-interest
bearing, unsecure and is due at the earlier of (1) December 31, 2022, and (2) the consummation of the IPO. On December 31, 2022, there
were no amounts outstanding, and the Promissory Notes had then expired. 

In
addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our founders or an affiliate
of our founders may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we
will repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment.
Up to 300,000 of such loans may be convertible into working capital units, at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender.
Such working capital units would be identical to the private units sold in the private placement. The terms of such loans by our founders
or their affiliates, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to
seek loans from parties other than our founders or an affiliate of our founders as we do not believe third parties will be willing to
loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account, but in the event that we
seek loans from any third parties, we will obtain a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

Private
Placement Units 

On
January 4, 2023, simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we consummated the sale of 370,500 Private Placement Units at a price of
 10.00 per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating total gross proceeds of 3,705,000. 

On
January 6, 2023, and effective January 9, 2023, the underwriters in our IPO purchased an additional 900,000 Units to exercise its over-allotment
option in full at a purchase price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 9,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the
full exercise of the over-allotment option, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 38,700 Private Placement Units, at a purchase
price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of 387,000. 

Our
Sponsor will be permitted to transfer the private units held by them to certain permitted transferees, including our officers and directors
and other persons or entities affiliated with or related to it or them, but the transferees receiving such securities will be subject
to the same agreements with respect to such securities as the founders. Otherwise, these private units (and underlying securities) will
be subject to certain transfer restrictions, subject to certain limited exceptions, as described under Principal Shareholders
 Restrictions on Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Units. 

Promissory
Note Related Party 

On
September 30, 2021, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the Promissory Note ), pursuant to which
the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 300,000. The Promissory Note was amended and restated on November 23,
2021, to change the December 31, 2021 due date to March 31, 2022, amended and restated on January 26, 2022 to change the March 31, 2022
due date to May 31, 2022 and amended and restated again on October 20, 2022 to change the May 31, 2022 due date to December 31, 2022.
The Promissory Note was non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2022, or (ii) the consummation of the IPO. 

On
September 27, 2023, the Company notified Equiniti Trust Company, the trustee of the Company s trust account (the Trust Account ),
that it was extending the time available to the Company to consummate its initial business combination from October 4, 2023, to January
4, 2024 (the Extension ). The Extension is the first of up to three (3) three-month extensions permitted under the Company s
governing documents. 

On
September 27, 2023, the Company extended the time to complete its initial business combination from October 4, 2023 to January 4, 2024
by depositing an aggregate of 690,000 into the Trust Account. In connection with this extension, on September 26, 2023, the Company
also entered into a non-interest bearing promissory note with the Sponsor for 690,000, that is payable on the earlier of January 4,
2024 or promptly after the completion of an initial business combination. On January 4, 2024, the Company deposited 165,000 into the
Trust Account to extend the deadline to complete the business combination from January 4, 2024 to April 4, 2024. On February 20, 2024,
the Company further raised 20,000 from the sponsor against a promissory note. In connection with this extension, on December 28, 2023,
the Company entered into a non-interest bearing promissory note with the Sponsor for 660,000, that is payable on the earlier of January
4, 2025 or promptly after the completion of an initial business combination. As on September 30, 2024, there was an amount of 1,152,500
outstanding as loan against a promissory note issued to the Sponsor for extension of the period of business combination from October
4, 2023 to September 4, 2024. On September 3, 2024 and October 2, 2024, the Company entered into the extension letters with the sponsors
to extend the timeline of the business combination from September 4, 2024 to October 4, 2024, and from October 4, 2024 to November 4,
2024, respectively. On November 4, 2024, the Company entered into the extension
letters with the sponsors to extend the timeline of the business combination from November 4, 2024 to December 4, 2024. The sponsors had
initiated an aggregate of 165,000 extension fund, including the September extension, into the trust account. 

Due
to Related Party 

The
Sponsor paid certain formation, operating or deferred offering costs on behalf of the Company. These amounts are due on demand and non-interest
bearing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31 2023, due to related party amounted to 504,708 and 199,318, respectively.

Administration
fee 

Commencing
on the effective date of the registration statement, an affiliate of the Sponsor shall be allowed to charge the Company an allocable
share of its overhead, up to 10,000 per month up to the close of the business combination, to compensate it for the Company s
use of its offices, utilities and personnel. An administration fee of 30,000 and 90,000 was recorded for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 respectively. 

Other
Contractual Obligations 

Underwriting
Agreement 

We
granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of IPO to purchase up to 900,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if
any, at the IPO price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full effective
January 9, 2023. Simultaneously, on January 4, 2023, an amount of 352,350 due to related party was converted into over-allotment of
Private Placement, and the underwriter deposited additional 34,650 on behalf of Sponsor for 17,325 Founder Shares for 2.00 per share
which was sold by the Sponsor to underwriters. The Company paid a cash underwriting commission of 0.125 per Unit for 900,000 additional
Units and the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred commission of 0.35 per Unit, an aggregate of 2,415,000, which will be paid
from the funds held in the Trust Account upon completion of the initial business combination. 

Concurrent
with the closing of the IPO, our Sponsor, at the option of the Company, sold to the underwriter or its designees 115,500 Founder Shares
for a purchase price of 2.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of 231,000. 

We
have agreed to sell to the underwriters, for 100.00, an option to purchase up to a total of 58,000 Units exercisable, in whole or in
part, at 11.50 per unit (or 115 of the Market Value), commencing on the consummation of our initial business combination, and expires
five years from the effective date of the IPO. The option and the 58,000 Units, as well as the 58,000 ordinary shares, the warrants to
purchase 58,000 ordinary shares that may be issued upon exercise of the option and the rights to purchase 5,800 ordinary shares upon
the completion of an initial business combination, have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for
a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the registration statement or the commencement of sales in the IPO pursuant
to Rule 5110(e)(1) of FINRA s Rules, during which time the option may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated,
or be subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative or put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the
securities, except as permitted under FINRA Rule 5110(e)(2). 

Advisory
Services Agreement 

The
Company engaged TenX Global Capital LP TenX ), a related party to the Company, as an advisor in connection with the Initial
Public Offering and business combination, to assist in hiring consultants and other services providers in connection with our Initial
Public Offering and the business combination, assist in the preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and other relevant
services to commence trading including filing the necessary documents as part of the transaction. Further, TenX will assist in preparing
the Company for investor presentations, conferences for due diligence, deal structuring and term negotiations. 

During
the period from September 15, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2023, a cash fee of 200,000 has been incurred as deferred offering
costs for these services of which 160,000 has been paid by the Sponsor through December 31, 2022 and additional 40,000 was paid subsequently
through December 31, 2023. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did
not have any commitments or contractual obligations. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the unaudited condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially
differ from those estimates. We have identified below critical accounting policies.

Ordinary
Shares Subject to Possible Redemption 

We
account for our ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability
instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption
rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within
the Company s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders 
equity. The Company s ordinary shares features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company s
control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption is presented
at redemption of 11.09 per share (plus any income earned from Trust Account) as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders 
equity section of the Company s balance sheets. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and
adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases
or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary shares are affected by charges against additional paid in capital or accumulated
deficit if additional paid in capital equals to zero. 

Net
Income (Loss) per Share 

The
Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. The statements of operations include
a presentation of income (loss) per redeemable share and income (loss) per non-redeemable share following the two-class method of income
(loss) per share. In order to determine the net income (loss) attributable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares, the
Company first considered the undistributed income (loss) allocable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares and the undistributed
income (loss) is calculated using the total net income (loss) less any dividends paid. The Company then allocated the undistributed income
(loss) ratably based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding between the redeemable and non-redeemable shares. Any remeasurement
of the accretion to redemption value of the ordinary shares subject to possible redemption was considered to be dividends paid to the
public shareholders. 

Deferred
Offering Costs 

Deferred
offering costs consist of underwriting, legal, accounting, and other expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that were directly
related to our IPO and that were charged to shareholders equity upon the completion of our IPO on January 4, 2023. As of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no deferred offering costs.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer,
evaluated, as of September 30, 2024, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)
and Rule 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to
the Company s lack of qualified SEC reporting professional. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to
ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management
believes that the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows for the period presented. Management intends to continue implement remediation steps to improve
our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we intend to expand and improve
our review process for complex securities and related accounting standards. We have improved this process by enhancing access to accounting
literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration
of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals. 

We
believe, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives
of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected.

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting
or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
