interest in Sisecam Wyoming LLC ("Sisecam Wyoming"), a trona ore mining and soda ash production business. The Partnership is organized into operating segments further described in Note 6. Segment Information . The Partnership s operations are conducted through, and its operating assets are owned by, its subsidiaries. The Partnership owns its subsidiaries through wholly owned operating company, NRP (Operating) LLC ("Opco"). As used in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the terms "NRP," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Natural Resource Partners L.P. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated or indicated by context. 
 
 Principles of Consolidation and Reporting 
 
 The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Partnership have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with Rule 10 - 01 of Regulation S- X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and notes thereto included in the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10 -K, which was filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024. Reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements to conform with current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported total assets, total liabilities, partners' capital, net income, or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standard 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023 - 07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280 Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023 - 07" ). The amendments in ASU 2023 - 07 improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about segment expenses. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and quarterly periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and will be adopted retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. NRP does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023 - 07 to have a material effect on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

 The Partnership has developed procedures to evaluate its long-lived assets for possible impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's net book value may not be recoverable. Potential events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, specific events such as a reduction in economically recoverable reserves or production ceasing on a property for an extended period. This analysis is based on historic, current and future performance and considers both quantitative and qualitative information. As a result of the Partnership's analyses, NRP recorded immaterial impairment expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Opco Credit Facility 
 
 In May 2023, the Partnership entered into the Sixth Amendment (the "Sixth Amendment) to the Opco Credit Facility (the "Opco Credit Facility"). The Sixth Amendment maintained the term of the Opco Credit Facility until August 2027. Lender commitments under the Opco Credit Facility increased from million to million, with the ability to expand such commitments to million with the addition of future commitments. In February 2024, the Partnership exercised its option under the Opco Credit Facility to increase the total aggregate commitment under the Opco Credit Facility twice, initially by million from million to million and subsequently by million from million to million. These increases in the total aggregate commitment were made pursuant to an accordion feature of the Opco Credit Facility. In connection with the initial increase, a new lender joined the lending group with a commitment of million. The Sixth Amendment also included modifications to Opco s ability to declare and make certain restricted payments. The Opco Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring Opco to maintain: 

A leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to EBITDDA (in each case as defined in the Opco Credit Facility) not to exceed 3.0x As of September 30, 2024, this ratio was 0.8x; and

1 The fair value of the Opco Senior Notes was estimated by management utilizing the present value replacement method incorporating the interest rate of the Opco Credit Facility. 
 2 The fair value of the Opco Credit Facility approximates the outstanding borrowing amount because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates and the terms of the credit facility allow the Partnership to repay the debt at any time without penalty. 
 3 The fair value of the Partnership's contract receivable is determined based on the present value of future cash flow projections related to the underlying asset at a discount rate of at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 

NRP had embedded derivatives in the preferred units related to certain conversion options, redemption features and the change of control provision that were accounted for separately from the preferred units as assets and liabilities at fair value on the Partnership's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Level 3 valuation of the embedded derivatives were based on numerous factors including the likelihood of the event occurring. The embedded derivatives were revalued quarterly and changes in their fair value would be recorded in other expenses, net on the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The embedded derivatives had zero value as of December 31, 2023 .

 INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Statements included in this 10-Q may constitute forward-looking statements. In addition, we and our representatives may from time to time make other oral or written statements which are also forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding: future distributions on our common and preferred units; our business strategy; our liquidity and access to capital and financing sources; our financial strategy; prices of and demand for coal, trona and soda ash, and other natural resources; estimated revenues, expenses and results of operations; projected future performance by our lessees; Sisecam Wyoming LLC s ("Sisecam Wyoming's") trona mining and soda ash refinery operations; distributions from our soda ash joint venture; the impact of governmental policies, laws and regulations, as well as regulatory and legal proceedings involving us, and of scheduled or potential regulatory or legal changes; and global and U.S. economic conditions. 
 
 These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and are made based upon our current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. See " Item 1A. Risk Factors " included in this Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for important factors that could cause our actual results of operations or our actual financial condition to differ. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income (loss) less equity earnings from unconsolidated investment; plus total distributions from unconsolidated investment, interest expense, net, debt modification expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, depreciation, depletion and amortization and asset impairments. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net income or loss attributable to partners, operating income or loss, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance, liquidity or ability to service debt obligations. There are significant limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance, including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring items that materially affect our net income, the lack of comparability of results of operations of different companies and the different methods of calculating Adjusted EBITDA reported by different companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA presented below is not calculated or presented on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA as defined in our partnership agreement or Consolidated EBITDDA as defined in Opco's debt agreements. For a description of Opco's debt agreements, see Note 9. Debt, Net in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein as well as in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 11. Debt, Net" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental performance measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis. 
 
 Distributable Cash Flow 
 
 Distributable cash flow ("DCF") represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus distributions from unconsolidated investment in excess of cumulative earnings, proceeds from asset sales and disposals, including sales of discontinued operations, and return of long-term contract receivable; less maintenance capital expenditures. DCF is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. DCF may not be calculated the same for us as for other companies. In addition, DCF presented below is not calculated or presented on the same basis as distributable cash flow as defined in our partnership agreement, which is used as a metric to determine whether we are able to increase quarterly distributions to our common unitholders. DCF is a supplemental liquidity measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others to assess our ability to make cash distributions and repay debt. 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 
 Free cash flow ("FCF") represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus distributions from unconsolidated investment in excess of cumulative earnings and return of long-term contract receivable; less maintenance and expansion capital expenditures and cash flow used in acquisition costs classified as investing or financing activities. FCF is calculated before mandatory debt repayments. FCF is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. FCF may not be calculated the same for us as for other companies. FCF is a supplemental liquidity measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others to assess our ability to make cash distributions and repay debt. 
 
 Leverage Ratio 
 
 Leverage ratio represents the outstanding principal of our debt at the end of the period divided by the last twelve months' Adjusted EBITDA as defined above. We believe that leverage ratio is a useful measure to management and investors to evaluate and monitor our indebtedness relative to our ability to generate income to service such debt and in understanding trends in our overall financial condition. Leverage ratio may not be calculated the same for us as for other companies and is not a substitute for, and should not be used in conjunction with, GAAP financial ratios.

 Executive Overview 
 
 We are a diversified natural resource company engaged principally in the business of owning, managing and leasing a diversified portfolio of mineral properties in the United States, including interests in coal and other natural resources and own a non-controlling 49 interest in Sisecam Wyoming, a trona ore mining and soda ash production business. Our common units trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "NRP." Our business is organized into two operating segments: 
 
 Mineral Rights consists of approximately 13 million acres of mineral interests and other subsurface rights across the United States. If combined in a single tract, our ownership would cover roughly 20,000 square miles. Our ownership provides critical inputs for the manufacturing of steel, electricity and basic building materials, as well as opportunities for carbon sequestration and renewable energy. We are working to strategically redefine our business as a key player in the transitional energy economy in the years to come. 
 
 Soda Ash consists of our 49 non-controlling equity interest in Sisecam Wyoming, a trona ore mining and soda ash production business located in the Green River Basin of Wyoming. Sisecam Wyoming mines the trona and processes it into soda ash that is sold both domestically and internationally into the glass and chemicals industries. 
 
 Corporate and Financing includes functional corporate departments that do not earn revenues. Costs incurred by these departments include interest and financing, corporate headquarters and overhead, centralized treasury, legal and accounting and other corporate-level activity not specifically allocated to a segment. 
 
 Our financial results by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are as follows:

Current Results/Market Commentary 
 
 Financial Results and Quarterly Distributions 
 
 We generated 182.3 million of operating cash flow and 184.3 million of free cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and ended the quarter with 76.2 million of liquidity consisting of 30.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and 45.3 million of available borrowing capacity under our Opco Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 our leverage ratio was 0.8 x. 
 
 In the first quarter of 2024, holders of our warrants to purchase common units (the "warrants") exercised a total of 1,219,665 warrants with a strike price of 34.00. We settled these warrants on a net basis with a total of 55.7 million in cash and 198,767 common units. In the second quarter of 2024, holders of our warrants exercised the remaining 320,335 warrants with a strike price of 34.00. We settled these warrants on a net basis with 10.0 million in cash and 89,059 common units. Following these transactions, of the originally issued 4.0 million warrants, after giving effect to these settlements and all prior settlements, no warrants remain outstanding. 
 
 In May 2024, we executed a negotiated transaction with holders of our Class A Preferred Units ("preferred units") pursuant to which we repurchased an aggregate of 40,000 preferred units for 40.0 million in cash. In September 2024, we redeemed the remaining 31,666 preferred units for 31.7 million in cash. Of the originally issued 250,000 preferred units, after giving effect to these redemptions and all prior redemptions, no preferred units remain outstanding. 
 
 In 2024, we exercised our option under the Opco Credit Facility to increase the total aggregate commitment under the Opco Credit Facility twice, initially by 30.0 million from 155.0 million to 185.0 million and subsequently by 15.0 million from 185.0 million to 200.0 million. These increases in the total aggregate commitment were made pursuant to an accordion feature of the Opco Credit Facility. In October 2024, we entered into the Seventh Amendment to the Opco Credit Facility which extended the maturity from August 2027 to October 2029. The Seventh Amendment also removed reference to the preferred units and warrants, which are no longer outstanding, and includes modifications to Opco's ability to declare and make certain restricted payments. 
 
 In February 2024, we paid a cash distribution of 0.75 per common unit of NRP with respect to the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as a 2.15 million cash distribution on the preferred units with respect to the fourth quarter of 2023. We paid a special cash distribution of 2.44 per common unit of NRP in March 2024 to help cover unitholder tax liabilities associated with owning NRP's common units in 2023. In May 2024, we paid a cash distribution of 0.75 per common unit of NRP with respect to the first quarter of 2024 as well as a 2.15 million cash distribution on the preferred units with respect to the first quarter of 2024. In August 2024, we paid a cash distribution of 0.75 per common unit of NRP with respect to the second quarter of 2024 as well as a 0.95 million cash distribution on the preferred units with respect to the second quarter of 2024. Future distributions on our common units will be determined on a quarterly basis by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors considers numerous factors each quarter in determining cash distributions, including profitability, cash flow, debt service obligations, market conditions and outlook, estimated unitholder income tax liability and the level of cash reserves that the Board of Directors determines is necessary for future operating and capital needs. 
 
 Mineral Rights Business Segment 
 
 Revenues and other income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 33.1 million, or 15 , as compared to the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 10.2 million and 10.1 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. These decreases were primarily due to lower metallurgical coal sales prices as well as lower thermal coal sales prices and volumes as compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Metallurgical coal prices continued to decline during the third quarter of 2024 primarily driven by muted steel demand resulting from sluggish construction activity in China as well as weak manufacturing demand globally. We expect pricing to remain relatively soft for both metallurgical and thermal coal as muted global steel demand impacts metallurgical coal, and mild weather, low natural gas prices, and high inventory levels impact thermal coal. However, continued price support above historical norms is expected due to limited access to capital for operators, qualified labor shortages, and input cost inflation. 
 
 We continue to explore carbon neutral revenue opportunities across our ownership footprint. While the timing and likelihood of additional cash flows from these activities is uncertain, we believe our large ownership throughout the United States provides additional opportunities to create value in this regard with minimal capital investment by us. Our carbon neutral revenue opportunities include the sequestration of carbon dioxide underground and in standing forests, lithium production, and the generation of electricity using geothermal, solar, and wind energy. 
 
 Soda Ash Business Segment 
 
 Revenues and other income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 41.4 million, or 71 , as compared to the prior year period primarily due to significantly lower sales prices driven by increased global production capacity, primarily from China, and weaker demand for flat glass due to a slowdown in global construction activity and weakness in demand for automobiles. Cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 37.9 million as compared to the prior year period as the decline in revenues and other income resulted in lower cash distributions received from Sisecam Wyoming in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We believe it will take several years for the world to absorb the additional soda ash supply recently introduced into the market and allow prices to rise back to historically normal equilibrium levels. The timing of this absorption will be highly dependent on China, which currently produces and consumes approximately 50 of global soda ash.

Coal Royalty Revenues 
 
 Approximately 75 of coal royalty revenues and approximately 55 of coal royalty sales volumes were derived from metallurgical coal during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Total coal royalty revenues decreased 17.9 million as compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to lower metallurgical coal sales prices as well as lower thermal coal sales prices and volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year quarter. 
 
 Transportation and Processing Services Revenues 
 
 Transportation and processing services revenues decreased 2.8 million primarily due to a temporary relocation of certain production off of NRP's coal reserves. The fee per ton associated with the transportation and processing of the non-NRP coal is less than the fee per ton associated with the transportation and processing of NRP coal. 
 
 Soda Ash 
 
 Revenues and other income related to our Soda Ash segment decreased 4.3 million as compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to significantly lower sales prices driven by increased global production capacity, primarily from China, and weaker demand for flat glass due to a slowdown in global construction activity and weakness in demand for automobiles.

Total operating expenses decreased 1.1 million as compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to a decrease in operating and maintenance expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease in operating and maintenance expenses was primarily due to lower overriding royalty expense from an agreement with Western Pocahontas Properties Limited Partnership ("WPPLP") in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. This overriding royalty expense is fully offset by coal royalty revenue we receive from this property. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 
 Interest expense, net increased 0.4 million primarily due to higher borrowings outstanding on the Opco Credit Facility during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period.

Mineral Rights Segment 

Operating cash flow, DCF and FCF decreased 7.3 million, 8.1 million and 7.3 million, respectively, primarily due to lower metallurgical coal sales prices as well as lower thermal coal sales prices and volumes as compared to the prior year quarter. 

Soda Ash Segment 

Operating cash flow, DCF and FCF decreased 16.7 million as compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to a lower distribution received from Sisecam Wyoming in the third quarter of 2024. 

Corporate and Financing 

Operating cash flow, DCF and FCF decreased 0.8 million as compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to higher cash paid for interest resulting from higher borrowings outstanding on the Opco Credit Facility during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Coal Royalty Revenues 
 
 Approximately 75 of coal royalty revenues and approximately 55 of coal royalty sales volumes were derived from metallurgical coal during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Total coal royalty revenues decreased 37.4 million as compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower metallurgical coal sales prices as well as lower thermal coal sales prices and volumes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Other Revenues 
 
 Other revenues increased 4.0 million primarily driven by higher oil and gas royalty and other revenues as compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Gain on Asset Sales and Disposals 
 
 Gain on asset sales and disposals increased 3.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period as a result of a coal property condemnation in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Soda Ash 
 
 Revenues and other income related to our Soda Ash segment decreased 41.4 million as compared to the prior year period primarily due to significantly lower sales prices driven by increased global production capacity, primarily from China, and weaker demand for flat glass due to a slowdown in global construction activity and weakness in demand for automobiles.

Operating cash flow, DCF and FCF decreased 50.9 million, 46.9 million and 50.8 million, respectively. The discussion by segment is as follows: 

Mineral Rights Segment 

Operating cash flow, DCF and FCF decreased 10.2 million, 6.2 million and 10.1 million, respectively, primarily due to lower metallurgical coal sales prices as well as lower thermal coal sales prices and volumes during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the prior year period. The decrease in DCF was partially offset by cash received related to a coal property condemnation in the second quarter of 2024. 

Soda Ash Segment 

Operating cash flow, DCF and FCF decreased 37.9 million as compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower distributions received from Sisecam Wyoming in the first nine months of 2024. 

Corporate and Financing Segment 

Operating cash flow, DCF and FCF decreased 2.8 million as compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to higher cash paid for interest resulting from higher borrowings outstanding on the Opco Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Cash Flows 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased 50.9 million, from 233.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 182.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to decreased cash flow within our Mineral Rights and Soda Ash segments, all discussed above. 
 
 Cash flows provided by investing activities increased 4.0, million from 2.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a coal condemnation payment received in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities decreased 86.5 million, from 256.7 million used in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 170.2 million used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the following: 

106.7 million of decreased cash used for the redemption of preferred units in 2024 as compared to 2023; 

65.4 million of decreased debt repayments in 2024 as compared to 2023; and 

13.5 million decreased distributions to preferred unitholders in 2024 as compared to 2023. 

These decreases in cash flow used were partially offset by the following: 

62.2 million of decreased borrowings on the Opco Credit Facility in 2024 as compared to 2023; 

32.1 million of increased cash used for the warrant settlements in 2024 as compared to 2023; 

2.9 million of increased cash used for other items, net in 2024 as compared to 2023; and 

1.9 million of increased distributions to common unitholders and the general partner in 2024 as compared to 2023.

For additional information regarding our debt and the agreements governing our debt, including the covenants contained therein, see Note 9. Debt, Net to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 
 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and accordingly, there are no off-balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities. 
 
 Related Party Transactions 
 
 The information required set forth under Note 11. Related Party Transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Recent Accounting Standards 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07"). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about segment expenses. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and quarterly periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and will be adopted retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-07 to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to market risk, which includes adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below: 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices. Historically, coal prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and are likely to continue to be volatile. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. In particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenues and could potentially trigger an impairment of our coal properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants. Because substantially all our reserves are coal, changes in coal prices have a more significant impact on our financial results. 
 
 We are dependent upon the effective marketing of the coal mined by our lessees. Our lessees sell the coal under various long-term and short-term contracts as well as on the spot market. Current conditions in the coal industry may make it difficult for our lessees to extend existing contracts or enter into supply contracts with terms of one year or more. Our lessees' failure to negotiate long-term contracts could adversely affect the stability and profitability of our lessees' operations and adversely affect our future financial results. If more coal is sold on the spot market, coal royalty revenues may become more volatile due to fluctuations in spot coal prices. 
 
 The market price of soda ash and energy costs directly affects the profitability of Sisecam Wyoming's operations. If the market price for soda ash declines, Sisecam Wyoming's sales revenues will decrease. Historically, the global market and, to a lesser extent, the domestic market for soda ash have been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our borrowings under the Opco Credit Facility, which is subject to variably interest rates based upon SOFR. At September 30, 2024, we had 154.7 million in borrowings outstanding under the Opco Credit Facility. If interest rates were to increase by 1 , annual interest expense would increase approximately 1.5 million, assuming the same principal amount remained outstanding during the year. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 NRP carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NRP management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the general partner of the general partner of NRP. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in the Partnership s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no material changes in the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting during the first nine months of 2024 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
