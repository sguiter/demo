 period and each payment is subject to the FCCR Condition, which relates to the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges for Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable. Incentive advisory fees are a form of variable consideration and therefore must be (i) deferred until such fees are probable of not being subject to significant reversal, and (ii) tied to a performance obligation in the contract with the customer so that revenue recognition depicts the transfer of the related advisory services to the customer. Accordingly, the Company does not record incentive advisory fee revenue in interim periods prior to the fourth quarter of the year in which the incentive fee is measured. The first-year installment of incentive advisory fees will generally be recognized only upon measurement in the fourth quarter of the first year of the period. The second- and third-year installments of incentive advisory fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis each quarter subject to meeting the FCCR Condition.

 of gross hotel revenue for managing the hotel employees and daily operations of the hotels, pursuant to Remington s hotel management agreements, subject to a specified floor (which is subject to increase annually based on increases in the consumer price index). The base management fee for each hotel is due monthly. Remington additionally receives an incentive management fee for hotels owned by Ashford Trust and Braemar whenever a hotel s gross operating profit GOP exceeds the hotel s budgeted GOP. The incentive fee is equal to the lesser of of each hotel s annual gross revenue or the amount by which the respective hotel s GOP exceeds the hotel s budgeted GOP. The incentive management fee, if any, for each hotel is due annually in arrears within days of the end of the fiscal year. However, if based on actual operations and revised forecasts the incentive fee is reasonably expected to be earned, payment is due monthly in arrears within days following the end of each calendar month, subject to final adjustment within days of the end of the fiscal year. The base management fees and incentive management fees that Remington receives for third-party owned properties vary by property. Other management fees primarily includes fees for health insurance programs administered on behalf of certain third-party properties. Health insurance program fees are recognized monthly at rates which approximate market rates for similar plans provided by independent insurance companies. Other management fees additionally includes fees for fixed monthly accounting services, revenue management services and other services at certain third-party properties. 
 Design and Construction Fees Revenue 
 Design and construction fees revenue primarily consists of revenue generated by our subsidiary, Premier Project Management LLC Premier ). Premier provides design and construction management services, capital improvements, refurbishment, project management, and other services such as purchasing, interior design, architectural services and freight management at properties. Premier receives fees for these services and recognizes revenue over time as services are provided to the customer. On February 12, 2024, Braemar entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Master Project Management Agreement with Premier and, on March 12, 2024, Ashford Trust entered into an Amended and Restated Master Project Management Agreement with Premier (collectively, the Premier Agreements ). The Premier Agreements modified the existing arrangements and provide that fees from Ashford Trust and Braemar will be payable monthly as the service is delivered based on the percentage of completion, as reasonably determined by Premier. The Premier Agreements resulted in contract modifications, as defined under ASC 606, which resulted in cumulative catch-up adjustments that increased design and construction fees in the first quarter of 2024, by a total of million. 
 Audio Visual Revenue 
 Audio visual revenue primarily consists of revenue generated within our INSPIRE segment by providing event technology services, such as audio visual services, audio visual equipment rental, staging and meeting services and event-related communication systems as well as related technical support, to our customers in various venues including hotels and convention centers. Revenue is recognized in the period in which services are provided pursuant to the terms of the contractual arrangements with our customers. Payment is typically due from customers within days. We also evaluate whether it is appropriate to present: (i) the gross amount that our customers pay for our services as revenue, and the related commissions paid to the venue as cost of revenue; or (ii) the net amount (gross revenue less the related commissions paid to the venue) as revenue. We are responsible for the delivery of the services, including providing the necessary labor and equipment to perform the services. We are generally subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers and, while in many cases the venue bills the end customer on our behalf, we bear the risk of collection from the customer. The venues commissions are not dependent on collections. As a result, our revenue is primarily reported on a gross basis. Cost of revenues for audio visual principally includes commissions paid to venues, direct labor costs, the cost of equipment sub-rentals, depreciation of equipment, amortization of signing bonuses, as well as other costs such as supplies, freight, travel and other overhead from our venue and customer facing operations and any losses on equipment disposal. 
 Other Revenue 
 Other revenue includes revenue provided by certain of our products and service businesses, including RED. RED s revenue is primarily generated through the provision of watersports activities and ferry and excursion services. The revenue is recognized as services are provided based on contractual customer rates. Payment is ordinarily due days after the end of the month in which services were rendered. Debt placement and related fees include revenue earned from providing placement, modifications, forbearances or refinancing of certain mortgage debt by our subsidiary, Lismore Capital II LLC Lismore ). For

 days after the services were rendered. 
 Under our project management agreements and hotel management agreements, we are entitled to be reimbursed for certain costs we incur on behalf of Ashford Trust, Braemar and other hotel owners with no added mark-up. Design and construction costs primarily consist of costs for accounting, overhead and project manager services. Hotel management costs primarily consist of the properties payroll, payroll taxes and benefits-related expenses at managed properties where we are the employer of the employees at the properties as provided for in our contracts with Ashford Trust, Braemar and other hotel owners. 
 The recognition of cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses for centralized software programs reimbursed by Ashford Trust and Braemar may result in temporary timing differences in our operating and net income. Over the long term, these programs and services are not designed to impact our economics, either positively or negatively. 
 Certain of our consolidated entities enter into contracts with customers that contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our consolidated entities overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the customer and the nature and value of the performance obligations within the applicable contracts. 
 Practical Expedients and Exemptions 
 We do not disclose the amount of variable consideration that we expect to recognize in future periods in the following circumstances: 
 (1) if we recognize the revenue based on the amount invoiced or services performed; 
 (2) if the consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation, and the terms of the consideration relate specifically to our efforts to transfer, or to a specific outcome from transferring the service. 
 Deferred Income and Contract Balances 
 Deferred income primarily consists of customer billings in advance of revenue being recognized from our advisory agreements and other products and services contracts. Current deferred income additionally includes customer deposits which could result in cash payments within the next 12 months. The change in the deferred income balance is primarily driven by cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by revenue recognized that was included in the deferred income balance at the beginning of the period.

However, because of the uncertain nature of reserve estimates, it is not presently possible to determine whether actual loss experience will conform to the assumptions used in estimating the liability. As a result, loss experience may not conform to the assumptions used in determining the estimated amounts for such liability at the balance sheet date. Accordingly, the ultimate liability could be significantly different than the amount indicated in the financial statements. 
 Litigation On December 20, 2016, a class action lawsuit was filed against one of the Company s subsidiaries in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Contra Costa alleging violations of certain California employment laws. The Court has entered an order granting class certification with respect to: (i) a statewide class of non-exempt employees who were allegedly deprived of rest breaks as a result of the subsidiary s previous written policy requiring employees to stay on premises during rest breaks; and (ii) a derivative class of non-exempt former employees who were not paid for allegedly missed breaks upon separation from employment. Notices to potential class members were sent out on February 2, 2021. Potential class members had until April 4, 2021 to opt out of the class, however, the total number of employees in the class has not been definitively determined and is the subject of continuing discovery. The opt out period has been extended until such time that discovery has concluded. In May of 2023, the trial court requested additional briefing from the parties to determine whether the case should be maintained, dismissed, or the class decertified. After submission of the briefs, the Court requested that the parties submit stipulations for the Court to rule upon. On February 13, 2024, the judge

In the event the Company fails to pay the required dividends on the Series CHP Units for two consecutive quarterly periods (a Preferred Unit Breach ), then until such arrearage is paid in cash in full, the dividend rate on the Series CHP Units will increase to per annum until no Preferred Unit Breach exists. Except with respect to certain protective provisions, no holder of Series CHP Units will have voting rights in its capacity as such. As long as any Series CHP Units are outstanding, the Company is prohibited from taking specified actions without the consent of at least of the holders of Series CHP Units, including (i) modifying the terms, rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series CHP Units or (ii) altering the rights, preferences or privileges of any Units of Ashford Holdings so as to adversely affect the Series CHP Units.

Overview 
 Ashford Inc., a Nevada corporation, is an alternative asset management company with a portfolio of strategic operating businesses that provides products and services primarily to clients in the real estate and hospitality industries, including Ashford Trust, Braemar, Stirling and our consolidated subsidiary, TSGF L.P. We became a public company in November 2014, and our common stock was listed on the NYSE American until the Company delisted its common stock on July 29, 2024. On August 8, the Company filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC to terminate the registration of the Company s common stock under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and suspend the Company s reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Form 15 became effective on November 6, 2024. The Company expects its reporting obligations will be automatically suspended as of January 1, 2025 pursuant to Rule 15d-6 of the Exchange Act. The Company intends to file an annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of November 11, 2024, Mr. Monty J. Bennett, Ashford Inc. s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of Ashford Trust, Braemar and Stirling, and his father, Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., Chairman Emeritus of Ashford Trust, hold a controlling interest in Ashford Inc. The Bennetts owned approximately 809,937 shares of our common stock, which represented an approximately 46.6 ownership interest in Ashford Inc., and owned 18,758,600 shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, which, along with all unpaid accrued and accumulated dividends thereon, is convertible at a price of 117.50 per share into an additional approximate 4,319,362 shares of Ashford Inc. common stock, which if converted as of November 11, 2024 would have increased Mr. Monty J. Bennett and Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr. s ownership interest in Ashford Inc. to approximately 84.7 . 
 We provide: (i) advisory services; (ii) asset management services; (iii) hotel management services; (iv) design and construction services; (v) event technology and creative communications solutions; (vi) mobile room keys and keyless entry solutions; (vii) watersports activities and other travel, concierge and transportation services; (viii) hypoallergenic premium room products and services; (ix) insurance policies covering general liability, workers compensation, business automobile claims and insurance claims services; (x) debt placement and related services; (xi) real estate advisory and brokerage services; and (xii) wholesaler, dealer manager and other broker-dealer services. We conduct these activities and own substantially all of our assets primarily through Ashford LLC, Ashford Services, Warwick and their respective subsidiaries. 
 We seek to grow through the implementation of three primary strategies: (i) increasing our assets under management; (ii) pursuing third-party business to grow our products and services businesses; and (iii) acquiring additional businesses which align with our strategic initiatives. 
 We are currently the advisor for Ashford Trust, Braemar, Stirling and TSGF L.P. In our capacity as advisor, we are responsible for implementing the investment strategies and managing the day-to-day operations of our clients and their respective hotels from an ownership perspective, in each case subject to the respective advisory agreements and the supervision and oversight of each client s respective boards of directors. Ashford Trust is focused on investing in full-service hotels in the upscale and upper upscale segments in the United States that have RevPAR generally less than twice the U.S. national average. Braemar invests primarily in luxury hotels and resorts with RevPAR of at least twice the U.S. national average. Stirling is focused on investing primarily in a diverse portfolio of stabilized income-producing hotels and resorts across all chain scales primarily located in the United States and became our client on December 6, 2023. TSGF L.P. invests in all types of real estate in the state of Texas. Each of Ashford Trust and Braemar is a REIT as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. The common stock of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar is traded on the NYSE. Stirling is privately held and Stirling s subsidiary Stirling OP is consolidated by Ashford Trust. TSGF L.P. is a privately held, consolidated subsidiary of the Company. 
 We provide the personnel and services that we believe are necessary for each of our clients to conduct their respective businesses. We may also perform similar functions for new or additional platforms. In our capacity as an advisor, we are not responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of our client s individual hotel properties, which duties are, and will continue to be, the responsibility of the hotel management companies that operate such hotel properties. Additionally, Remington, a subsidiary of the Company, operates certain hotel properties for Ashford Trust, Braemar, Stirling and third parties. As of September 30, 2024, Remington provided hotel management services to 112 properties that were open and operating, 55 of which were owned by third parties.

Recent Developments 
 Termination of the Registration of the Company s Common Stock 
 On April 1, 2024, the Board, upon the recommendation of a Special Committee of the Board consisting entirely of independent and disinterested directors, approved a transaction whereby the Company would effect a reverse/forward stock split of the Company s shares of common stock, in conjunction with terminating the Company s public company reporting obligations and delisting the Company s common stock from the NYSE American, subject to obtaining the requisite approval of the reverse stock split by the Company s stockholders at the Special Meeting. 
 At the Special Meeting held on July 22, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved proposals necessary to implement the Transaction as part of the Company s plan to terminate the public registration of the Company s common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, suspend the Company s duty to file periodic reports and other information with the SEC under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and delist the Company s common stock from the NYSE American. At the Special Meeting, the Company s stockholders voted to effect the Reverse Stock Split, which was immediately followed by the Forward Stock Split. 
 The Reverse Stock Split and the Forward Stock Split were effected on July 29, 2024 at 5:01 p.m. Eastern Time and 5:02 p.m. Eastern Time, respectively. As a result of the Transaction, each stockholder owning fewer than 10,000 shares of the Company s common stock in any one account immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split received 5.00 per share, without interest, in cash for each share of the Company s common stock held by such stockholder at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, and such stockholders are no longer stockholders of the Company. Stockholders owning 10,000 or more shares of the Company s common stock in any one account immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split were not entitled to receive any cash for their fractional share interests resulting from the Reverse Stock Split, if any, and will instead remain stockholders in the Company holding, as a result of the Forward Stock Split, the same number of shares of common stock as such stockholders held immediately before the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split. 
 The intended effect of the Transaction is to reduce the number of record holders of the Company s common stock to fewer than 300 so that the Company will be eligible to terminate the public registration of the Company s common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, suspend the Company s duty to file periodic reports and other information with the SEC under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and delist the Company s common stock from the NYSE American. 
 Following the Transaction, we currently intend to continue to have our financial statements audited by a public accounting firm, but we do not intend to make such financial statements available to our stockholders, unless required by law or otherwise agreed to by the Company. The Company expects that the deregistration of its common stock under the Exchange Act would eliminate the significant expense required to comply with its Exchange Act reporting obligations and the SEC s proxy rules. The Company estimates the annual savings will be approximately 2.5 million per year, including ongoing expenses for compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and other accounting, legal, printing and other miscellaneous costs associated with being a publicly traded company. 
 As a result of the Transaction, the Company paid stockholders owning fewer than 10,000 shares of the Company s common stock in any one account immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split a total of approximately 6.9 million to purchase approximately 1.4 million shares of the Company s common stock. The last day of trading for the Company s common stock was July 26, 2024 and the Company s common stock is no longer traded on the NYSE American.

 ________ 
 (1) The increase in base advisory fees is primarily due to higher revenue of 185,000 and 113,000 from Ashford Trust and Braemar, respectively. See note 3 in our condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of the advisory services revenue recognition policy. 
 60 

(2) Incentive advisory fees for the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter includes the pro rata portion of the third year and second year installment, respectively, of the 2022 Braemar incentive advisory fee. Incentive fee payments are subject to meeting the December 31st FCCR Condition each year, as defined in our advisory agreements. The annual total stockholder return for Ashford Trust and Braemar did not meet the relevant incentive fee thresholds during the 2023 measurement period. 
 (3) Other advisory revenue from Braemar is a result of the 5.0 million cash payment received upon stockholder approval of the Fourth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement in June 2017. The payment is included in deferred income on our condensed consolidated balance sheet and is being recognized evenly over the initial 10-year term of the agreement. 
 (4) The decrease in hotel management fees revenue is primarily due to lower incentive management fees of 736,000 partially offset by an increase in other management fees from third parties of 471,000. Other management fees primarily includes fees for health insurance programs administered on behalf of certain third-party properties. Other management fees additionally includes fees for fixed monthly accounting services, revenue management services and other services at certain third-party properties. 
 (5) The decrease in design and construction fees revenue is due to lower revenue from Ashford Trust and third parties of 1.4 million and 393,000, respectively, partially offset by higher revenue from Braemar of 588,000. 
 (6) The 3.7 million increase in audio visual revenue is due to an increase in the number of hotels which INSPIRE provides services and an increase in demand for group events. 
 (7) The 751,000 increase in watersports, ferry and excursion services revenue is primarily due to an increase of 1.2 million in revenue in the 2024 quarter in RED s operations in the U.S. Virgin Islands partially offset by a decrease of 508,000 in RED s operations in Key West, Florida. 
 (8) The increase in debt placement and related fee revenue is due to higher revenue of 376,000 from Braemar partially offset by lower revenue of 288,000 from Ashford Trust. Debt placement and related fees are earned by Lismore for providing debt placement, modification, forbearance and refinancing services. 
 (9) Premiums earned is recognized by our insurance subsidiary, Warwick, from insurance premiums related primarily to general liability, workers compensation and business automobile contracts incurred on behalf of our clients Ashford Trust, Braemar and third-party clients and their respective management companies. Warwick was incorporated in December 2023. 
 (10) Cash management fees include revenue earned by providing active management and investment of Ashford Trust and Braemar s excess cash in short-term U.S. Treasury securities. 
 (11) Other services revenue relates to other hotel services provided by our consolidated subsidiaries, OpenKey and Pure Wellness, to Ashford Trust, Braemar and third parties. 
 (12) The increase in cost reimbursement revenue in the 2024 quarter is primarily due to an increase in Remington s cost reimbursement revenue of 3.6 million.

 ________ 
 (1) The DCP obligation is recorded as a liability at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. The loss in the 2024 quarter and the gain the 2023 quarter are primarily attributable to increases and decreases, respectively, in the fair value of the DCP obligation. See note 13 in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Cost of Revenues for Design and Construction. Cost of revenues for design and construction decreased 823,000, or 27.7 , to 2.2 million during the 2024 quarter compared to 3.0 million for the 2023 quarter due to decreases in capital expenditures from Ashford Trust and Braemar in the 2024 quarter. 
 Cost of Revenues for Audio Visual. Cost of revenues for audio visual increased 2.1 million, or 8.7 , to 25.9 million during the 2024 quarter compared to 23.9 million for the 2023 quarter, primarily due to an increase in the number of hotels which INSPIRE provides services and an increase in demand for group events. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 590,000, or 8.3 , to 6.5 million for the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter.

 3,950 3,733 217 Non-capitalizable - software costs 259 291 (32) Total general and administrative 14,139 10,702 3,437 
 ________

 Other. Other operating expense increased 2.2 million, or 41.3 , to 7.6 million for the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. Other operating expense primarily includes the operating expenses of our insurance subsidiary Warwick and cost of goods sold, royalties and operating expenses associated with RED, OpenKey and Pure Wellness. The increase in the 2024 quarter was primarily due to an increase of 2.0 million of expenses related to Warwick, which was incorporated in December 2023. 
 Reimbursed Expenses. Reimbursed expenses increased 2.9 million to 110.8 million during the 2024 quarter compared to 107.9 million for the 2023 quarter primarily due to increased expenses incurred by Remington. 
 Reimbursed expenses recorded may vary from cost reimbursement revenue recognized in the quarter due to timing differences between the costs we incur for centralized software programs and the related reimbursements we receive from Ashford Trust and Braemar. Over the long term, these timing differences are not designed to impact our economics, either positively or negatively. The timing differences consisted of the following (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Cost reimbursement revenue 110,710 107,866 2,844 Reimbursed expenses 110,753 107,869 2,884 Net total (43) (3) (40) 
 Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Entities. Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities were losses of 43,000 and 327,000 for the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter, respectively. Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities primarily represents earnings (loss) in our equity method investment in REA Holdings. See note 2 in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 576,000 to 4.2 million during the 2024 quarter compared to 3.7 million for the 2023 quarter. The increase is primarily due to an increase in the balance of the Company s notes payable under our Credit Facility in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. Interest expense in the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter included expense of 3.3 million and 2.7 million, respectively, related to the Company s Credit Facility. Interest expense relates to our Credit Facility and notes payable, lines of credit and finance leases held by our consolidated subsidiaries. See note 5 in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Amortization of Loan Costs. Amortization of loan costs was 277,000 and 269,000 for the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter, respectively. 
 63 

Interest Income. Interest income was 719,000 and 522,000 for the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter, respectively. The increase is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on the Company s cash and cash equivalents in the 2024 quarter. 
 Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was income of 1.1 million and expense of 75,000 in the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter, respectively. 
 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. Income tax (expense) benefit changed by 1.8 million from a benefit of 205,000 in the 2023 quarter to 1.6 million of expense in the 2024 quarter. Current income tax expense increased by 1.7 million from 311,000 in the 2023 quarter to 2.0 million in the 2024 quarter. Deferred income tax benefit decreased by 97,000 from a benefit of 516,000 in the 2023 quarter to a benefit of 419,000 in the 2024 quarter. The increase in our total income tax expense for the 2024 quarter is primarily due to an increase in tax liabilities associated with foreign tax expense from our investment in foreign affiliates. Our current income tax expense increased significantly in comparison to the 2023 quarter as a result of our ability to utilize certain loss carryforwards in the 2023 quarter along with other deferred tax expense adjustments resulting from equity in earnings and state tax law legislative changes. 
 Net (Income) Loss from Consolidated Entities Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities were allocated income of 25,000 and a loss of 190,000 in the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter, respectively. See notes 2 and 10 in our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details regarding ownership interests, carrying values and allocations. 
 Net (Income) Loss Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests were allocated a loss of 42,000 and income of 111,000 in the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter, respectively.

 Preferred Dividends, Declared and Undeclared. Preferred dividends increased 328,000, or 3.6 , to 9.4 million during the 2024 quarter compared to 9.1 million for the 2023 quarter due to accumulating and compounding dividends incurred in the 2024 quarter related to undeclared Series D Convertible Preferred Stock dividends from the second quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023. See note 11 in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

 66 

(3) Other advisory revenue from Braemar is a result of the 5.0 million cash payment received upon stockholder approval of the Fourth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement in June 2017. The payment is included in deferred income on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and is being recognized evenly over the initial 10-year term of the agreement.

 (6) The 14.5 million increase in audio visual revenue is primarily due to an increase in the number of hotels which INSPIRE provides services and an increase in demand for group events. 
 (7) The 7.0 million increase in watersports, ferry and excursion services revenue is due to an increase of 1.5 million as a result of the timing of RED s acquisition of Alii Nui in March of 2023 and increases of 6.4 million and 332,000 in revenue in RED s operations in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of 1.2 million from RED s operations in Key West, Florida. 
 (8) The increase in debt placement and related fee revenue is due to higher revenue of 640,000 from Ashford Trust and higher revenue of 1.3 million from Braemar. Debt placement and related fees are earned by Lismore for providing debt placement, modification, forbearance and refinancing services. 
 (9) Premiums earned is recognized by our insurance subsidiary, Warwick, from insurance premiums related primarily to general liability, workers compensation and business automobile contracts incurred on behalf of our clients Ashford Trust, Braemar and third-party clients and their respective management companies.

 (11) Other services revenue relates to other hotel services provided by our consolidated subsidiaries, OpenKey and Pure Wellness, to Ashford Trust, Braemar and third parties. 
 (12) The increase in cost reimbursement revenue in the 2024 period is primarily due to an increase in Remington s cost reimbursement revenue of 26.2 million from an increase in Remington s operations. The increase was partially offset by a 4.4 million decrease in Ashford Securities cost reimbursement revenue in the 2024 period as a result of the Company reimbursing Braemar for Braemar s contributions to fund Ashford Securities as calculated pursuant to the Fourth Amended and Restated Contribution Agreement.

Salaries and Benefits Expense. Salaries and benefits expense increased by 2.8 million, or 4.0 , to 70.9 million for the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The change in salaries and benefits expense consisted of the following (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Salaries and benefits: Salary expense (1) 
 42,479 41,096 1,383 Bonus expense (2) 
 11,601 14,019 (2,418) Benefits related expenses (1) 
 14,385 13,091 1,294 Total salary, bonus, and benefits related expenses 68,465 68,206 259 Non-cash equity-based compensation: Class 2 LTIP units and stock option grants 
 98 97 1 Employee equity grant expense 1,591 1,308 283 Total equity-based compensation 1,689 1,405 284 Non-cash (gain) loss in deferred compensation plan (3) 
 737 (1,479) 2,216 Total salaries and benefits 70,891 68,132 2,759 
 ________ 
 (1) The increase in salary expense and benefits related expenses is primarily due to increased headcount at our INSPIRE and RED subsidiaries as their respective operations increased in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. 
 (2) The decrease in bonus expense is primarily due to a reduction to the Company s bonus accrual in the 2024 period. 
 (3) The DCP obligation is recorded as a liability at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. The loss in the 2024 period and the gain in the 2023 period are primarily attributable to increases and decreases, respectively, in the fair value of the DCP obligation which is based on the Company s common stock price. See note 13 in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Cost of Revenues for Design and Construction. Cost of revenues for design and construction decreased 3.5 million, or 37.3 to 5.9 million during the 2024 period compared to 9.4 million for the 2023 period due to decreases in capital expenditures from Ashford Trust and Braemar in the 2024 period. 
 Cost of Revenues for Audio Visual. Cost of revenues for audio visual increased 7.7 million, or 9.4 , to 89.4 million during the 2024 period compared to 81.7 million for the 2023 period, primarily due to an increase in the number of hotels which INSPIRE provides services and an increase in demand for group events. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 1.8 million, or 8.3 , to 19.3 million for the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of FF E which was previously leased to Ashford Trust under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. Depreciation and amortization expense for the 2024 period and the 2023 period excludes depreciation expense related to audio visual equipment of 4.3 million and 3.7 million, respectively, which is included in cost of revenues for audio visual and also excludes depreciation expense for the 2024 period and the 2023 period related to marine vessels in the amount of 2.2 million and 1.4 million, respectively, which are included in other operating expense. 
 68 

General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses increased by 14.6 million, or 44.7 , to 47.4 million for the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The change in general and administrative expense consisted of the following (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Professional fees (1) 
 21,949 8,941 13,008 Office expense 
 10,605 10,123 482 Public company costs 543 453 90 Director costs 1,292 1,371 (79) Travel and other expense (2) 
 12,388 11,057 1,331 Non-capitalizable - software costs 614 814 (200) Total general and administrative 47,391 32,759 14,632 
 ________ 
 (1) The increase in professional fees in the 2024 period is primarily due to 4.6 million in fees incurred in the 2024 period related to the Company s initiative to terminate the registration of our common stock as discussed above, an increase in fees of 3.1 million related to the Company s ongoing strategic initiatives with Stirling and TSGF L.P. and 2.5 million of expense the Company paid to reimburse Braemar for Braemar s contributions to fund Ashford Securities as calculated pursuant to the Fourth Amended and Restated Contribution Agreement. 
 (2) The increase in travel and other expense is primarily due to increases in the Company s business travel, insurance and other related expenses for our products and services companies in the 2024 period. 
 Other. Other operating expense increased 10.6 million, or 61.8 , to 27.8 million for the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. Other operating expense primarily includes the operating expenses of our insurance subsidiary Warwick and the cost of goods sold, royalties and operating expenses associated with RED, OpenKey and Pure Wellness. The increase in the 2024 period was primarily due to an increase of 7.4 million of expenses related to Warwick, which was incorporated in December 2023, and an increase of approximately 4.4 million of RED s operating expenses. Other operating expenses for the 2023 period includes a loss on the sale of FF E previously leased to Ashford Trust of 1.0 million under the Ashford Trust ERFP agreement. 
 Reimbursed Expenses. Reimbursed expenses increased 21.5 million to 338.5 million during the 2024 period compared to 317.0 million for the 2023 period primarily due to increased expenses incurred by Remington. 
 Reimbursed expenses may vary from cost reimbursement revenue recognized in the period due to timing differences between the costs we incur for centralized software programs and the related reimbursements we receive from our clients. Over the long term, these timing differences are not designed to impact our economics, either positively or negatively. The timing differences consisted of the following shown below (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Cost reimbursement revenue 338,351 317,094 21,257 Reimbursed expenses 338,482 317,023 21,459 Net total (131) 71 (202) 
 Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Entities. Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities were earnings of 422,000 and losses of 1.2 million for the 2024 period and the 2023 period, respectively. Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities primarily represents earnings (loss) in our equity method investment in REA Holdings. See note 2 in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 69 

Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 2.6 million to 12.5 million during the 2024 period compared to 9.9 million for the 2023 period. The increase is primarily due to an increase in the balance of the Company s notes payable under our Credit Facility in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. Interest expense in the 2024 period and the 2023 period included expense of 9.7 million and 7.6 million, respectively, related to the Company s Credit Facility. The increase in interest expense is also due to higher average interest rates during the 2024 period. The average SOFR rates in the 2024 period and the 2023 period were 5.30 and 4.90 . The average Prime Rates in the 2024 period and the 2023 period were 8.48 and 8.10 , respectively. Interest expense relates to our Credit Facility and notes payable, lines of credit and finance leases held by our consolidated subsidiaries. See note 5 in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Amortization of Loan Costs. Amortization of loan costs was 823,000 and 775,000 for the 2024 period and the 2023 period, respectively. Amortization of loan costs relates to our Credit Facility and notes payable held by our consolidated subsidiaries. See note 5 in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Interest Income. Interest income was 2.0 million and 1.2 million for the 2024 period and the 2023 period, respectively. The increase is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on the Company s cash and cash equivalents in the 2024 period. 
 Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments. Realized loss on investments was 0 and 160,000 for the 2024 period and the 2023 period, respectively. The realized loss on investments for the 2023 period primarily related to realized losses on shares of common stock of Ashford Trust and Braemar purchased by Remington on the open market and held for the purpose of providing compensation to certain employees. See note 7 in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Other Income (Expense). Other income was 1.4 million and 259,000 in the 2024 period and the 2023 period, respectively. 
 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. Income tax (expense) benefit changed by 5.0 million from 1.6 million in expense in the 2023 period to 6.6 million in expense in the 2024 period. Current income tax expense increased by 552,000 from 3.5 million in the 2023 period to 4.0 million in the 2024 period. Deferred income tax expense increased by 4.4 million from a benefit of 1.8 million in the 2023 period to expense of 2.6 million in the 2024 period. The increase in our total income tax expense for the 2024 period is primarily due to an increase in current tax liabilities associated with foreign tax expense from our investment in foreign affiliates and the increase in our equity in earnings of REA Holdings. Our deferred income tax expense increased significantly in comparison to the 2023 period as a result of our ability to utilize certain loss carryforwards in the 2023 period along with other deferred tax expense adjustments resulting from equity in earnings and state tax law legislative changes. 
 Net (Income) Loss from Consolidated Entities Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities were allocated a loss of 431,000 in the 2024 period and 692,000 in the 2023 period. See notes 2 and 10 in our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details regarding ownership interests, carrying values and allocations. 
 Net (Income) Loss Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests were allocated income of 96,000 and 399,000 in the 2024 period and the 2023 period, respectively. Redeemable noncontrolling interests represents ownership interests in Ashford Holdings which include the Series CHP Units which are recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in the mezzanine section of our condensed consolidated balance sheets. For a summary of ownership interests, carrying values and allocations, see notes 2 and 11 in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Preferred Dividends, Declared and Undeclared. Preferred dividends, declared and undeclared, increased 683,000 to 27.8 million during the 2024 period compared to 27.1 million for the 2023 period primarily due to compounding dividends incurred in the 2024 period related to undeclared Series D Convertible Preferred Stock dividends from the second quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 70 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses primarily attributable to paying our employees, investments and other capital expenditures to grow our businesses, interest and principal payments on our Credit Facility and our subsidiaries borrowings and dividends on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. We expect to meet our liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations, existing cash balances and borrowings under our Credit Facility or other loans, which we believe will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our existing non-discretionary obligations and anticipated ordinary course operating expenses. Additionally, the Company estimates that the deregistration of its common stock under the Exchange Act will result in annual savings of approximately 2.5 million per year in expenses previously associated with being a publicly traded company. 
 Loan Agreements On March 31, 2023, the Company amended its Credit Agreement, previously entered into on April 1, 2022, with Mustang Lodging Funding LLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders from time to time party thereto. The amendment replaced the one-month LIBOR rate with Adjusted Term SOFR. The Credit Agreement evidences the Credit Facility in the amount of 100.0 million, including a 50.0 million term loan funded upon closing and commitments to fund up to an additional 50.0 million of term loans in up to five separate borrowings within 24 months after the Closing Date, subject to certain conditions. The Credit Facility is a five-year interest-only facility with all outstanding principal due at maturity, with three successive one-year extension options subject to an increase in the interest rate during each extension period. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest, at the Company s option, at either Adjusted Term SOFR plus an applicable margin, or the Base Rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Credit Agreement for Adjusted Term SOFR loans will be 7.35 per annum and the applicable margin for Base Rate loans will be 6.35 per annum, with increases to both applicable margins of 0.50 , 0.75 and 1.00 per annum during each of the three extension periods, respectively. Undrawn balances of the Credit Facility were subject to an unused fee of 1.0 during the first 24 months of the term, payable on the last business day of each month. 
 The Credit Facility does not require the maintenance of financial covenants, but if the ratio (the Leverage Ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness that is recourse to the Company or any guarantor (less unrestricted cash) to consolidated EBITDA of the Company and its subsidiaries is greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter during the term of the loan, including any extension period, then the Company is required to apply 100 of the excess cash flow generated during such fiscal quarter to prepay the term loans. The Company may not pay dividends on the Company s shares of common stock or preferred stock if the Leverage Ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1.00 after giving effect to the payment of such dividends. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company, Ashford LLC, and certain subsidiaries of the Company, and secured by, among other things, all of the assets of Ashford LLC and each guarantor and a pledge of the equity interests in Ashford LLC and each guarantor. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants or other requirements related to the Credit Agreement and was in compliance with all covenants or other requirements related to debt held by our subsidiaries. The Company does not expect the Leverage Ratio under our Credit Agreement to exceed 3.00 to 1.00 or debt held by our subsidiaries to violate any loan covenants within one year of the issuance of the financial statements. 
 On March 24, 2023, INSPIRE amended its credit agreement by entering into the INSPIRE Amendment. The INSPIRE Amendment increased the maximum borrowing capacity under INSPIRE s Revolving Note from 3.0 million to 6.0 million, provides for a 20.0 million Term Note and an Equipment Note pursuant to which, until September 24, 2027, INSPIRE may request advances up to 4.0 million in the aggregate to purchase new machinery or equipment to be used in the ordinary course of business. The INSPIRE Amendment extended the maturity date of INSPIRE s notes from January 1, 2024 to March 24, 2028. Monthly principal payments commenced on April 1, 2023 for the term note in the amount of approximately 167,000. Borrowings under the revolving note require monthly payments of interest only until the maturity date and borrowings under the equipment note require monthly principal payments at 1/60th of the original principal amount of each advance. The notes bear interest at the Daily Adjusting SOFR Rate plus a margin of 2.75 and the undrawn balance of the revolving note and the equipment note are subject to an unused fee of 0.25 per annum. On July 11, 2024, the INSPIRE Amendment was amended to increase the maximum amount available under the equipment note from 4.0 million to 7.0 million. 
 Certain segments of our business are capital intensive and may require additional financing from time to time. Any additional financings, if and when pursued, may not be available on favorable terms or at all, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital resources. Aggregate portfolio companies notes payable, net were 42.0 million and 39.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For further discussion see note 5 in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 71 

Preferred Stock Dividends As of September 30, 2024, the Company had aggregate undeclared preferred stock dividends of approximately 38.9 million, which relates to the second quarter of 2024, the fourth quarter of 2023 and the second and fourth quarters of 2021. On April 14, 2024, the Company paid 8.7 million of dividends previously declared by the Board with respect to the Company s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for the first quarter of 2024. On September 25, 2024, the Board declared a cash dividend on the Company s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company paid the dividend of 8.7 million, or 0.455 per share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, on October 9, 2024. 
 All dividends, declared and undeclared, are recorded as a reduction in net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders in the period incurred in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. All accrued dividends accumulate and compound until paid in cash or converted into common stock of the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation for the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. Unpaid Series D Convertible Preferred Stock dividends, declared and undeclared, totaling 47.6 million and 28.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are recorded as a liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as dividends payable. 
 The independent members of the Board plan to revisit the dividend payment policy with respect to the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock on an ongoing basis and will make decisions on such preferred dividend payments based on the ongoing liquidity and capital needs of the Company. 
 Each share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock: (i) has a liquidation value of 25 per share plus the amount of all unpaid accrued and accumulated dividends on such share; (ii) accrues cumulative dividends at the rate of 7.28 per annum; (iii) participates in any dividend or distribution on the common stock in addition to the preferred dividends; (iv) is convertible, along with all unpaid accrued and accumulated dividends thereon, into voting common stock at 117.50 per share; and (v) provides for customary anti-dilution protections. In the event the Company fails to pay the dividends on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for two consecutive quarterly periods (a Preferred Stock Breach ), then until such arrearage is paid in cash in full: (A) the dividend rate on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock will increase to 10.00 per annum until no Preferred Stock Breach exists; (B) no dividends on the Company s common stock may be declared or paid, and no other distributions or redemptions may be made, on the Company s common stock; and (C) the Board will be increased by two seats and the holders of 55 of the outstanding Series D Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to fill such newly created seats. The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is beneficially held primarily by Mr. Monty J. Bennett, the Chairman of our Board and our Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., who is Mr. Monty J. Bennett s father. 
 To the extent not paid on April 15, July 15, October 15 and January 15 of each calendar year in respect of the quarterly periods ending on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, respectively (each such date, a Dividend Payment Date ), all accrued dividends on any share shall accumulate and compound on the applicable Dividend Payment Date whether or not declared by the Board and whether or not funds are legally available for the payment thereof. All accrued dividends shall remain accumulated, compounding dividends until paid in cash or converted to common shares. See note 11 in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Additional information pertaining to other liquidity considerations of the Company can be found in Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Recent Developments. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 63.6 million and 52.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, respectively, and 16.2 million and 23.2 million of restricted cash, respectively. The majority of the Company s cash and cash equivalents are owned by Ashford LLC, Ashford Services and Warwick and are either invested in short-term U.S. Treasury securities with maturity dates of less than 90 days or held at commercial banks in insured cash sweep accounts, which are fully insured by the FDIC. Our principal sources of funds to meet our cash requirements include: net cash provided by operations and existing cash balances, which include borrowings from our existing lending agreements. Additionally, our principal uses of funds are expected to include possible operating shortfalls, capital expenditures, preferred dividends, debt interest and principal payments and strategic acquisitions to grow our products and services companies. Items that impacted our cash flow and liquidity during the periods indicated are summarized as follows: 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities . Net cash flows provided by operating activities were 32.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash flows provided by operating activities of 9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash flows from operating activities were primarily due to the timing of working capital cash flows such as collecting receivables, settling with vendors and settling with related parties, primarily our clients Ashford Trust and Braemar. 
 72 

Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in investing activities were 20.0 million. These cash flows consisted of capital expenditures primarily for FF E, audio visual equipment and marine vessels totaling 16.2 million, cash paid for TSGF L.P. s investment of 4.6 million, cash paid for asset acquisitions of 268,000 and payments totaling 214,000 to acquire the remaining noncontrolling interest in Pure Wellness. These were offset by cash inflows of 948,000 in proceeds received from the sale of FF E and 337,000 in proceeds from the repayment of a note receivable. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in investing activities were 25.8 million. These cash flows consisted of capital expenditures primarily for FF E, audio visual equipment and marine vessels totaling 17.5 million, net cash paid to acquire Alii Nui of 6.7 million, net cash paid in the asset acquisition of TSGF L.P. of 2.2 million and issuance of notes receivable of 1.3 million. These were offset by cash inflows of 1.0 million from proceeds from a note receivable and 849,000 from the asset acquisition of RHC. 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in financing activities were 7.9 million. These cash flows consisted of 31.5 million of payments on revolving credit facilities, 8.7 million of dividend payments on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, 6.9 million of payments for the repurchase of common stock, 3.6 million of payments on notes payable, 325,000 of payments on finance leases, 172,000 of distributions to noncontrolling interests and 100,000 of payments of contingent consideration from our acquisition of Alii Nui in the first quarter of 2023. These were offset by 34.0 million of proceeds from borrowings on revolving credit facilities, 6.8 million of cash contributions from investors purchasing equity in our consolidated subsidiary TSGF L.P. and 2.6 million of proceeds from borrowings on notes payable. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in financing activities were 1.3 million. These cash flows consisted of 26.1 million of dividend payments on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, 2.9 million of payments on notes payable, purchases of 359,000 of treasury stock, 516,000 of distributions to consolidating noncontrolling interests, 409,000 of loan cost payments and 321,000 of payments on finance leases. These were offset by 28.7 million of proceeds from borrowings on notes payable, 17.0 million of which related to the Company s Credit Agreement, and 466,000 of net borrowings on revolving credit facilities. 
 
 Seasonality 
 Quarterly revenues may be adversely affected by events beyond our control, such as extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or alerts, civil unrest, government shutdowns, airline strikes or reduced airline capacity, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel and products and services. To the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues, we expect to utilize cash on hand or borrowings to fund operations. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 There have been no material changes since December 31, 2023, outside the ordinary course of business, to contractual obligations and commitments included in the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K, other than items as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our accounting policies that are critical or most important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our primary market risk exposures consist of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our debt instruments that bear interest at variable rates that fluctuate with market interest rates as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk At September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness of 143.0 million included 134.9 million of variable-rate debt. The impact on our results of operations of a 100 basis point change in interest rates on the outstanding balance of variable-rate debt at September 30, 2024 would be approximately 1.3 million annually. Interest rate changes have no impact on the remaining 8.1 million of fixed rate debt. 
 73 

The amount above was determined based on the impact of a hypothetical interest rate on our borrowings and assumes no changes in our capital structure. As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed at September 30, 2024, it does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date. Accordingly, the information presented herein has limited predictive value. As a result, the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on exposures that arise during the period, the hedging strategies at the time, and the related interest rates. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk The majority of our revenues, expenses and capital purchases are transacted in U.S. dollars. INSPIRE has operations in both Mexico and the Dominican Republic and Remington has operations in both Mexico and Costa Rica. Therefore, we have exposure with respect to exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred. We have chosen not to hedge foreign exchange risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments. RED s operations outside of the U.S. are primarily transacted in U.S. dollars, which is the official currency of the Turks and Caicos Islands. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective (i) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 As disclosed in our Annual Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, a material weakness was identified during the Company s financial statement close process for the fourth quarter of 2023 and preparation of the 2023 Form 10-K solely as it pertains to the Company s new insurance subsidiary, Warwick, that was formed in December 2023, and more specifically solely related to management s review control over evaluating whether the revenue and expense from the one-time transfer of the casualty insurance loss portfolio to Warwick should eliminate in consolidation. To remediate this material weakness, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we modified our existing control related to the accounting for the elimination in consolidation of Warwick s revenue and expense to ensure that our consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company concluded that the control was operating effectively as of September 30, 2024. As a result, management concluded that the material weakness was remediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, whether any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. Based on the evaluation we conducted, other than the remediation of the material weakness identified and discussed above, our management has concluded that no such changes have occurred.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 On December 20, 2016, a class action lawsuit was filed against one of the Company s subsidiaries in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Contra Costa alleging violations of certain California employment laws. The Court has entered an order granting class certification with respect to: (i) a statewide class of non-exempt employees who were allegedly deprived of rest breaks as a result of the subsidiary s previous written policy requiring employees to stay on premises during rest breaks; and (ii) a derivative class of non-exempt former employees who were not paid for allegedly missed breaks upon separation from employment. Notices to potential class members were sent out on February 2, 2021. Potential class members had until April 4, 2021 to opt out of the class, however, the total number of employees in the class has not been definitively determined and is the subject of continuing discovery. The opt out period has been extended until such time that discovery has concluded. In May of 2023, the trial court requested additional briefing from the parties to determine whether the case should be maintained, dismissed, or the class decertified. After submission of the briefs, the Court requested that the parties submit stipulations for the Court to rule upon. On February 13, 2024, the judge ordered the parties to submit additional briefing related to on-site breaks. The Court has ordered the parties to complete a second mediation no later than January 31, 2025. While we believe it is reasonably possible that we may incur a loss associated with this litigation, because there remains uncertainty under California law with respect to a significant legal issue, discovery relating to class members continues, and the trial judge retains discretion to award lower penalties than set forth in the applicable California employment laws, we do not believe that any potential loss to the Company is reasonably estimable at this time. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts have been accrued. 
 We are also engaged in other legal proceedings that have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated. To the extent the claims giving rise to these legal proceedings are not covered by insurance, they relate to the following general types of claims: employment matters, tax matters, matters relating to compliance with applicable law (for example, the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws), and other general matters. The likelihood of loss for these legal proceedings is based on definitions within contingency accounting literature. We recognize a loss when we believe the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Legal costs associated with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. Based on the information available to us relating to these legal proceedings and/or our experience in similar legal proceedings, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, we had a cyber incident that resulted in the potential exposure of certain personal information. We have completed an investigation and have identified certain information that may have been exposed and notified potentially impacted individuals pursuant to applicable state guidelines. All systems have been restored. We believe that we maintain a sufficient level of insurance coverage related to such events, and the related incremental costs incurred to date are immaterial. In February of 2024, two class action lawsuits were filed; one in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and a second in the 68th District Court for Dallas County related to the cyber incident. The lawsuit filed in the 68th District Court was subsequently dismissed and refiled in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. On March 12, 2024, the Court ordered the two cases to be consolidated. On May 17, 2024, we filed a Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint which is currently pending before the Court. 
 Our assessment may change depending upon the development of any current or future legal proceedings, and the final results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If we ultimately do not prevail in one or more of these legal matters, and the associated realized losses exceed our current estimates of the range of potential losses, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in future periods. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC, which describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, or prospects in a material and adverse manner. Other than as set forth below, as of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The Company has voluntarily delisted its common stock from the NYSE American and intends to deregister the Company s common stock under the Exchange Act, which will result in less disclosure about the Company and will result in the Company s stockholders not having the protections provided by the liability provisions of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ). 
 75 

On April 1, 2024, the Board, upon the recommendation of a Special Committee of the Board consisting entirely of independent and disinterested directors, approved a transaction whereby the Company would effect a reverse/forward stock split of the Company s shares of common stock, in conjunction with terminating the Company s public company reporting obligations and delisting the Company s common stock from the NYSE American, subject to obtaining the requisite approval of the reverse stock split by the Company s stockholders at the Special Meeting. 
 At the Special Meeting held on July 22, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved proposals necessary to implement the Transaction as part of the Company s plan to terminate the public registration of the Company s common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, suspend the Company s duty to file periodic reports and other information with the SEC under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and delist the Company s common stock from the NYSE American. At the Special Meeting, the Company s stockholders voted to effect the Reverse Stock Split, which was immediately followed by the Forward Stock Split. 
 The Reverse Stock Split and the Forward Stock Split were effected on July 29, 2024 at 5:01 p.m. Eastern Time and 5:02 p.m. Eastern Time, respectively. As a result of the Transaction, each stockholder owning fewer than 10,000 shares of the Company s common stock in any one account immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split received 5.00 per share, without interest, in cash for each share of the Company s common stock held by such stockholder at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, and such stockholders are no longer stockholders of the Company. Stockholders owning 10,000 or more shares of the Company s common stock in any one account immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split were not entitled to receive any cash for their fractional share interests resulting from the Reverse Stock Split, if any, and will instead remain stockholders in the Company holding, as a result of the Forward Stock Split, the same number of shares of common stock as such stockholders held immediately before the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split. The intended effect of the Transaction was to reduce the number of record holders of the Company s common stock to fewer than 300 so that the Company would be eligible to terminate the public registration of the Company s common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, suspend the Company s duty to file periodic reports and other information with the SEC under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and delist the Company s common stock from the NYSE American. 
 The Company delisted its common stock on July 29, 2024. On August 8, the Company filed a Form 15 with the SEC to terminate the registration of the Company s common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and suspend the Company s reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Form 15 became effective on November 6, 2024. The Company expects its reporting obligations will be automatically suspended as of January 1, 2025 pursuant to Rule 15d-6 of the Exchange Act. 
 Following the Transaction, we currently intend to continue to have our financial statements audited by a public accounting firm, but we do not intend to make such financial statements available to our stockholders, unless required by law or otherwise agreed to by the Company. The Company expects that the deregistration of its common stock under the Exchange Act would eliminate the significant expense required to comply with its Exchange Act reporting obligations and the SEC s proxy rules. The Company estimates the annual savings will be approximately 2.5 million per year, including ongoing expenses for compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and other accounting, legal, printing and other miscellaneous costs associated with being a publicly traded company. 
 Stockholders holding the Company s common stock following the Transaction and subsequent filing to become a non-reporting entity may no longer have the information that is currently provided in the Company s filings with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act regarding such matters as the Company s business operations and developments, legal proceedings involving the Company, the Company s financial results, the compensation of the Company s directors and named executive officers, and Company securities held by the Company s directors, officers and major stockholders. In addition, it is likely that there will be limited liquidity for the Company s common stock and that trading of shares may only continue in privately negotiated sales. As a result, stockholders may not be able to purchase or sell the common stock at all or at prices they desire. 
 Further, the Company s stockholders will no longer have the protections provided by the liability provisions of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to the Company and the Company s directors, officers and major stockholders, including the short-swing profit provisions of Section 16, the proxy solicitation rules under Section 14, the stock ownership reporting rules under Section 13, provisions relating to personal attestation by officers about accounting controls and procedures potential criminal liability regarding the disclosure by the Company.

Unpaid Series D Convertible Preferred Stock dividends, declared and undeclared, totaling 47.6 million and 28.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are recorded as a liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as dividends payable. As previously disclosed, each share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock accrues cumulative preferred dividends at the rate of 7.28 per annum and will participate in any dividend or distribution on the common stock in addition to the preferred dividends. 
 On April 14, 2024, the Company paid 8.7 million of dividends previously declared by the Board with respect to the Company s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for the first quarter of 2024. On September 25, 2024, the Board declared a cash dividend on the Company s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company paid the dividend of 8.7 million, or 0.455 per share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, on October 9, 2024.
