On February 12, 2024, the Company began trading as "BLMH" on the OTCQB. 
 
 Additionally, effective January 12, 2024, i) each outstanding option to purchase shares of Unrivaled's common stock (a Company Option was converted automatically into a stock option to purchase an identical number of shares of Bl m common stock, (ii) each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Unrivaled's common stock (a Company Warrant was converted automatically into a warrant to purchase an identical number of shares of Bl m common stock, and (iii) each outstanding promissory note convertible into shares of Unrivaled's common stock (a Company Note was automatically converted into a promissory note convertible into an identical number of shares of Bl m common stock, in each case, on the same terms and conditions as applied to the Company Option, Company Warrant and Company Note, respectively, immediately prior to the effective date and as set forth in the documentation relating to such Company Option, Company Warrant and Company Note. 
 
 Effective January 12, 2024, Unrivaled Brands, Inc. completed a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio of 1 -for- (the Reverse Stock Split ). As a result of the Reorganization, the current stockholders of Unrivaled became stockholders of Bl m with the same number and percentage of shares of Bl m as they held in Unrivaled immediately prior to the Reorganization, subject to any changes from the implementation of the Reverse Stock Split. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect this Reverse Stock Split and adjustment of the preferred stock conversion ratios. 

million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company incurred pre-tax net loss from continuing operations of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . Pre-tax net loss from continuing operations was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had an accumulated deficit of million and million, respectively. At September 30, 2024 , the Company had a consolidated cash balance of million. Management expects to experience further net losses in 2024 and in the foreseeable future. The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operating activities to fund its ongoing operations. The Company's future success is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations and generate cash from operating activities. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to generate enough revenue or raise capital to support its operations. 
 
 The Company will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing, additional collaborative relationships or other arrangements until it is able to raise revenues to a point of positive cash flow. The Company is evaluating various options to further reduce its cash requirements to operate at a reduced rate, as well as options to raise additional funds, including obtaining loans and selling common stock. There is no guarantee that it will be able to generate enough revenue or raise capital to support its operations, or if it is able to raise capital, that it will be available to the Company on acceptable terms, on an acceptable schedule, or at all. 
 
 The issuance of additional securities may result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of the Company's current stockholders. Obtaining loans, assuming these loans would be available, will increase the Company's liabilities and future cash commitments. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain further funds required for its continued operations or that additional financing will be available for use when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If the Company is not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, it will not be able to meet its other obligations as they become due and the Company will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease its operations. 
 
 The risks and uncertainties surrounding the Company's ability to continue to raise capital and its limited capital resources raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. In an effort to achieve liquidity that would be sufficient to meet all of its commitments, the Company has undertaken a number of actions, including minimizing capital expenditures and reducing recurring expenses. However, management believes that even after taking these actions, the Company will not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy all of its future financial obligations. The risks and uncertainties surrounding the ability to raise capital, the limited capital resources, and the weak industry conditions impacting the Company s business raise substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern. 

Significant Accounting Policies 
 
 The significant accounting policies and critical estimates applied by the Company in these interim unaudited consolidated financial statements are the same as those applied in the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s 2023 Form 10 -K, unless otherwise disclosed in these accompanying notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the interim period ended September 30, 2024 .

 The Company sources cannabis products for retail from various vendors. However, as a result of regulations in the State of California, the Company s California retail operations must use vendors licensed by the State. As a result, the Company is dependent upon the licensed vendors in California to supply products. If the Company is unable to enter into relationships with sufficient members of properly licensed vendors, the Company s sales may be impacted. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company did not have any concentration of vendors for inventory purchases. However, this may change depending on the number of vendors who receive appropriate licenses to operate in the State of California.

Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit, which is the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment. The Company conducts its annual goodwill impairment assessment on November 1, and between annual tests if the Company becomes aware of an event or a change in circumstances that would indicate the carrying value may be impaired. For the purpose of the goodwill impairment assessment, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as step zero to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary step one ). The balance of goodwill at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively.

 The Company does not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. Hence, the Company uses the simplified method described in Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 to estimate the expected term of share option grants. The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined by examining the historical volatilities for the Company s common stock. The Company will continue to analyze the historical stock price volatility and expected term assumptions as more historical data for the Company s common stock becomes available. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on the U.S. treasury instruments whose term was consistent with the expected term of the Company s stock options. The expected dividend assumption is based on the Company s history and expectation of dividend payouts. The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Company has assumed no dividend yield for purposes of estimating the fair value of the Company stock-based compensation.

 Outlook 
 
 The Company will continue to focus on its performing assets, particularly California retail assets. In particular, the Company continues to emphasize on retail business fundamentals including a robust, curated and diverse product offering, improving inventory turn and vendor management to continue to optimize gross margins, effective marketing strategies focused on driving loyalty, creating dynamic websites that provide a seamless brand experience, reactivation of lapsed customers, and new customer acquisitions while continuing to deliver positive ROIs. The Company remains excited as it embarks on reinvigorating the Korova brand. The Company will continue to focus on reducing and streamlining its corporate overhead and rightsizing the Company. This outlook is based on several management assumptions that are largely outside the control of the Company, including the continued overall down trending market conditions and highly promotional competitive landscape in our key markets. With a disciplined approach to analyzing retail performance and customer relationship management, a management team with extensive retail and cannabis industry and capital markets experience, deep relationships in the industry, and a commitment to investing in its team and, specifically, its company culture, the Company is encouraged that it will emerge from its current restructuring efforts as an effective cannabis company. We will continue to seek further opportunities to expand profitability and maximize returns for its shareholders.

Revenue 
 
 Overall revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.36 million compared to 3.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 0.57 million or 15.0 . Revenue from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was composed of retail revenue of 4.28 million and distribution revenue of 0.08 million. This compared to the prior quarter ended June 30, 2024 in which revenue from continuing operations consisted of retail revenue of 3.76 million and distribution revenue of 0.04 million. 
 
 Retail revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.53 million or 14.0 compared to the consecutive prior quarter ended June 30, 2024. By September 30, 2024, management had implemented the Company's standard operating procedures for retail operations in the three additional Northern California dispensaries, which was consolidated as of May 1, 2024 and had operated under prior management's existing procedures for the fiscal second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Distribution revenue for the fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2024 was generally consistent with the fiscal second quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.92 million, a decrease of 0.29 million or 13.0 , compared to 2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to an inventory adjustment of 0.28 million in the cannabis distribution segment during the prior quarter. 
 
 Gross profit from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.45 million compared to 1.59 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 0.86 million or 53.8 . The increase in gross profit was directly impacted by the increase in revenue as described above. The Company's overall gross margin improved from the prior consecutive quarter at 56.1 compared to 41.9 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The improvement was primarily due to the implementation of the Company's standard operating procedures for retail margins in the three additional Northern California dispensaries as of September 30, 2024, in addition to the inventory adjustment of 0.28 million in the cannabis distribution segment during the prior quarter. Similarly, gross profit for on-going retail operations increased to 53.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 49.5 for th e preceding quarter.

Selling, General Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.29 million compared to 6.33 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The quarter-over-quarter decrease of 2.04 million or 32.3 was primarily due to the recognition of 1.85 million loss on litigation as a result of the judgment against the Company by Greenlane Holdings, LLC during the prior consecutive quarter. Refer to " Note 21 - Commitments and Contingencies ". 
 
 Operating Loss 
 
 The Company realized an operating loss from continuing operations of 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.58 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of 4.38 million or 66.6 . The decrease in operating loss from the preceding quarter was primarily due to the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and an impairment loss on long-lived assets of 1.71 million recognized during the prior quarter, in addition to the increase in gross profit as described above. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 
 The Company recognized other expense of 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other income of 13.98 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. This was primarily due to a gain on extinguishment of debt of 15.18 million recognized during the fiscal second quarter as a result of the disposition of People's First Choice, LLC, versus no such transactions in the consecutive prior quarter. In addition, the Company recognized an unrealized gain on investment of 0.52 million in the current period compared to an unrealized loss on investment of 0.77 million in the consecutive prior quarter. 
 
 Discontinued Operations 
 
 Net loss from discontinued operations was 0.11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income from discontinued operations of 16.23 million for the consecutive prior quarter, an decrease of 16.34 million or 100.7 . Discontinued operations for all periods presented consist of the Company's cultivation operations, Bl m Santa Ana, and The Spot. The decrease in net income from discontinued operations was primarily due to a gain on disposal of assets of 16.54 million recognized upon the sale of Bl m Santa Ana on June 10, 2024. 
 
 Non-GAAP Reconciliations 
 
 Non-GAAP earnings is a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles US GAAP ). Non-GAAP earnings is not a measurement of the Company's financial performance under US GAAP and should not be considered as alternative to net income, operating income, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with US GAAP, or as alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity. In addition, in evaluating non-GAAP earnings, you should be aware that in the future the Company will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate non-GAAP earnings. The Company's presentation of non-GAAP earnings should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. 
 
 Non-GAAP earnings has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under US GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) it does not reflect the Company's cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs, (iii) it does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company's debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP earnings does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) it does not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Company's statements of cash flows, and (vi) other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as comparative measures. 
 
 The Company compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the US GAAP amounts excluded from such non-GAAP financial measures. The Company further compensates for the limitations in our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting comparable US GAAP measures more prominently.

Table of Contents 

The Company believes that non-GAAP earnings facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). The Company also presents non-GAAP earnings because (i) it believes that this measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company's industry, (ii) the Company believes that investors will find these measures useful in assessing the Company's ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) the Company uses non-GAAP earnings internally as benchmark to compare its performance to that of its competitors. 
 
 In the presentation of the financial results below, the Company reconciles non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Income (Loss) with net income (loss) attributable to continuing operations, the most directly comparable US GAAP measure. Management believes that this presentation may be more meaningful in analyzing our income generation. 
 
 On a non-GAAP basis, the Company recorded non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Loss of 1.54 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.62 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Loss of 8.84 million and 10.98 million, respectively. The details of those expenses and non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-cash items are set forth below:

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND GOING CONCERN 
 
 While we incurred pre-tax net income from continuing operations of 0.88 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred pre-tax net loss from continuing operations of 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and expect to experience further net losses in the foreseeable future. We have an accumulated deficit of 437.02 million and 454.18 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 48.32 million, including 1.03 million of cash compared to a working capital deficit of 57.86 million, including 0.42 million of cash, as of December 31, 2023. Current assets were approximately 0.07 times current liabilities as of September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 0.08 times current liabilities as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 We have not been able to generate sufficient cash from operating activities to fund our ongoing operations. Since our inception, we have raised capital through private sales of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to achieve profitable operations and generate cash from operating activities. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate enough revenue and/or raise capital to support our operations. We will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing, additional collaborative relationships or other arrangements until we are able to raise revenues to a point of positive cash flow. We continue to evaluate various options to further reduce our cash requirements to operate at a reduced rate, as well as options to raise additional funds, including obtaining loans and selling common stock. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate enough revenue and/or raise capital to support our operations, or if we are able to raise capital, that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, on an acceptable schedule, or at all. 
 
 The risks and uncertainties surrounding the Company s ability to continue to raise capital and its limited capital resources raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.31 million compared to 0.48 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.83 million, or 172.5 . The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to income from employee retention credits of 1.23 million in the prior year, versus none in the current year. In May 2024, the Company expanded its retail operations through the addition of three dispensaries in Northern California, which contributed to a total increase in gross profit of 2.12 million. Since August 2022, management has implemented a turnaround plan to stabilize operations and position the Company for profitability. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, management took decisive action by reducing its presence in Southern California to alleviate financial strains from the related debt and allow the Company to redirect resources, enabling better allocation of capital. In May 2024, the Northern California Transactions presented new revenue opportunities and redefined the Company s market presence. This strategic expansion is expected to enhance operating cash flow by tapping into a growing customer base and leveraging synergies with existing operations. Together, these initiatives align with management s goal of optimizing cash flow and ensuring sustainable growth. Management anticipates improvements in cash flow from operating activities as the Company continues to execute its strategic restructuring. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.34 million compared to 0.62 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.71 million, or 274.5 . The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the cash received upon the sale of equity interests in a cultivation business in the amount of 1.30 million in January 2024, compared to proceeds from investments and notes receivable of 0.78 million in the prior year. In addition, during the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the Company acquired 0.96 million in cash from Coastal Pines Group as part of the transactions on May 1, 2024. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.42 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of 0.84 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.26 million, or 149.9 . The decrease in cash provided by financing activities as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the January 2023 Private Placement of Series V Preferred Stock which provided cash proceeds of 1.97 million, versus no such transactions in the current year.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. These accounting policies are described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 DISCLOSURE ABOUT OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not have any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that constitute off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 
 This item is omitted as it is not required for a smaller reporting company. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer are responsible for conducting an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to a reasonable level as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Based on the results of its assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024 based on such criteria due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below: 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Failure to timely record transactions and to timely review account reconciliations resulting in post-closing adjustments and restatement of the financial statements. 

31

Table of Contents 

Remediation Plan 
 
 We plan to enhance our internal control over financial reporting in an effort to remediate the material weaknesses described above. We are committed to ensuring that our internal control over financial reporting is designed and operating effectively. Our remediation process will include: 

Enhancing the organizational structure to support financial reporting processes and internal controls. 

Investing in IT systems to enhance our operational and financial reporting and internal controls. 

Establishing effective general controls over IT systems to ensure that information produced can be relied upon by process level controls is relevant and reliable. 

Providing guidance, education and training to employees relating to our accounting policies and procedures. 

Further developing and documenting detailed policies and procedures regarding business processes for significant accounts, critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates. 

We expect to remediate these material weaknesses during fiscal year 2024. However, we may discover additional material weaknesses that may require additional time and resources to remediate. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We regularly assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and enhance our controls in response to internal control assessments and external audit and regulatory recommendations. No changes in internal control over financial reporting have been identified in connection with the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
