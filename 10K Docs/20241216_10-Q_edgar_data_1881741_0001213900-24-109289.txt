CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q Report ), including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations, contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, regarding future events and the future results of the Company that are based on current expectations,
estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which the Company operates and the beliefs and assumptions of the management
of the Company. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, 
 projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, 
 estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
These factors include but are not limited to the Summary Risk Factors and Risk Factors described herein. 

You should read the matters
described and incorporated by reference in Summary Risk Factors and Risk Factors and the other cautionary
statements made in this Report, and incorporated by reference herein, as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever
they appear in this Report. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Report will prove to be accurate and therefore
prospective investors are encouraged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date of this Report or the date of any document incorporated by reference in this Report, as applicable. Except to
the extent required by applicable law or regulation, we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect
events or circumstances after the date of this Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

Summary Risk Factors 

We face risks and uncertainties
related to our business, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, risks associated with our business include: 

our ability to realize anticipated
benefits of the business combination, and unanticipated expenses or delays in connection with the business combination; 

if we seek stockholder approval
of our initial business combination, our initial stockholders and members of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such
initial business combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote; 

past performance by our sponsor
and our management team including their affiliates and including the businesses referred to herein, may not be indicative of future performance
of an investment in us or in the future performance of any business that we may acquire. 

our management may not be able
to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. Upon the loss of control of a target business, new management
may not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. 

we may not be able to complete
our initial business combination in the prescribed time frame; 

your only opportunity to affect
the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares
from us for cash; 

we may not be successful in
retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

ii 

our officers and directors
may have difficulties allocating their time between our Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest with
our business or in approving our initial business combination. We are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss
could adversely affect our ability to operate; 

we may not be able to obtain
additional financing to complete our initial business combination or reduce the number of shareholders requesting redemption. The ability
of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the
most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure; 

we may issue our shares to
investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares
at that time; 

Our sponsor paid an aggregate
of 25,000, or approximately 0.009 per founder share, and, accordingly, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution from
the purchase of the shares of our Class A common stock; 

Since our sponsor paid only
approximately 0.009 per share for the founder shares, our officers and directors could potentially make a substantial profit even if
we acquire a target business that subsequently declines in value; 

you may not be given the opportunity
to choose the initial business target or to vote on the initial business combination. 

Subsequent to the completion
of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges
that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our share price, which could cause
you to lose some or all of your investment; 

trust account funds may not
be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy; 

an active market for our public
securities may not develop and you will have limited liquidity and trading; 

the availability to us of funds
from interest income on the trust account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to the business combination; and 

our financial performance following
a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack an established record of revenue, cash flows and experienced
management. 

Changes in laws or regulations,
or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete
our initial business combination and results of operations. 

Other risk factors included
under Risk Factors in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and set forth below under Risk Factors .

the underwriter a -day option from the date of Initial Public Offering to purchase up to additional Units to cover over-allotments,
if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On December 29, 2021, the underwriters exercised
this option and purchased additional Units generating gross proceeds of . 

Simultaneously with the closing
of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the Private Placement of an aggregate of 
Units (the Private Placement Units to Singto, LLC, f/k/a Koo Dom Investment, LLC (the Sponsor at a
purchase price of per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of . Upon exercise
of the underwriter over-allotment option, the Sponsor purchased an additional Private Placement Units at a purchase price of 
per unit generating additional gross proceeds of . 

As of December 29, 2021,
transaction costs amounted to consisting of of underwriting fees (gross of a discount of ), of
deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee
(the Trust Account ), the fair value of the shares of Class A common stock issued to the underwriter of and
 of other offering costs related to the Initial Public Offering. Cash of was held outside of the Trust Account on December
29, 2021 and was available for working capital purposes. As described in Note 6, the deferred underwriting fees are contingent
upon the consummation of the Business Combination within 12 months (or up to 21 months if extended) from the closing of the Initial Public
Offering. 

Following the closing of
the Initial Public Offering on December 29, 2021, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the
Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was placed in the Trust Account which may be invested in U.S. government
securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment
Company Act ), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market
fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the
earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below. 

5 

of the
net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest
earned on the Trust Account). The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 
or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient
for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment
Company Act ). Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, management has agreed that an amount equal to at least per
Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering, including proceeds of the Private Placement Units, will be held in a trust account Trust
Account ), located in the United States and invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section
2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself
out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined
by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the
Trust Account, as described below. 

The Company will provide
the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of
their Public Shares either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of
a tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a
Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public
Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be per Public Share, plus any pro
rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination
with respect to the Company s warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded at a redemption value and classified
as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480). 

All of the Public Shares
contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with our liquidation, if there is a stockholder
vote or tender offer in connection with our initial business combination and in connection with certain amendments to our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified
in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of a company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified
outside of permanent equity. Given that the Public Shares will be issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants).
the initial value of Class A common stock classified as temporary equity will be the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with
ASC 470-20. The Class A common stock is subject to ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable.
we have the option to either (i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that
it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize
changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value
at the end of each reporting period. We have elected to recognize the changes immediately. The accretion or remeasurement will be treated
as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings. or in absence of retained earnings. additional paid-in capital). While redemptions
cannot cause the Company s net tangible assets to fall below , the Public Shares are redeemable and will be classified
as such on the balance sheet until such date that a redemption event takes place. 

If the Company seeks stockholder
approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the outstanding shares voted
are voted in favor of the Business Combination, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a stockholder vote is
not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business
or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation ),
conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file
tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is
required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business
or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not
pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has
agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in
favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting,
and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.

of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The holders of the Founder
Shares have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection
with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the
substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 
of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (ii)
with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-business combination activity, unless the Company provides
the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 

Charter Amendments 

On March 28, 2023, the Company
held a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the Meeting ). At the Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the Charter
Amendment, which extends the date by which the Company must consummate its initial Business Combination from March 29, 2023 to December
29, 2023, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, provided the sponsor or its designees deposit into the trust
account an amount equal to per share for each public share or , prior to the commencement of each extension period (the
 Extension ). The Company filed the Charter Amendment with the Office of the Secretary of State of Delaware on September 28,

Board of Directors) (the Extension Amendment Proposal ). Stockholders holding shares of common stock exercised
their right to redeem their shares for cash at an approximate price of per share of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result,
approximately were removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. 

Following the redemption,
the Company s remaining shares of Class A common stock outstanding were . The Sponsor has continued to make monthly deposits
into the Trust Account of for five of the nine monthly extensions, from March 29, 2023 until August 29, 2023.

period from March 29, 2023 to December 29, 2023, and updating certain defined terms in the Trust Agreement (the First Amendment
to the Trust Agreement ).

Going Concern Consideration 

The Company expects to incur
significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern
considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that if the Company is unsuccessful in
consummating an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the
requirement that the Company cease all operations, redeem the Public Shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve raises substantial doubt
about the ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. Management has determined that the Company will need to raise additional funds to meet the working capital needs
of the Company prior to the consummation of an initial business combination or the winding up of the Company as stipulated in the Company s
amended and restated memorandum of association. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements has been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), which contemplate continuation
of the Company as a going concern. 

Risks and Uncertainties 

As a result of the military
action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, further
escalation of the conflict between the State of Israel and Hamas, as well as further escalation of tensions between the State of Israel
and various countries in the Middle East and North Africa, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global
trade, the Company s ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company
ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. Further, the Company s ability to consummate
a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a
result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to
the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Company s
financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable. The unaudited
condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

References to the Company, 
 us, our or we refer to Arogo Capital Acquisition Corp. The following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and related
notes included herein. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company
incorporated in June 2021 as a Delaware corporation whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition,
stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business
combination. 

Our Sponsor is Singto, LLC,
f/k/a Koo Dom Investment, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The registration statement for our initial public offering was declared
effective on December 23, 2021. On December 29, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 10,350,000 units at 10.00 per unit,
with each unit consisting of one Class A common stock and one redeemable warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase
one Class A common stock at a price of 11.50 per share. 

On December 29, 2021, simultaneously
with the consummation of the Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 466,150 Units (the Private
Placement Units to Singto, LLC, f/k/a Koo Dom Investment, LLC, our sponsor, at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating
total gross proceeds of 4,661,500 (the Private Placement ).

the initial public offering on December 29, 2021, 105,052,500 10.15 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the
initial public offering and the private placement was deposited into a trust account, invested in United States government securities 
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.
Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax
obligations as described in the initial public offering, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the completion of a business combination or the redemption of 100 of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business
combination within the time required time period. 

We have until December 29,
2024, to complete the initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such period,
we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten
business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes
(less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption
will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions,
if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of
our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to
our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption
rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business
combination by December 29, 2024.

Charter Amendment Regarding Extension and Share
Redemptions 

On March 24, 2023, the Company
held a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the Meeting ). At the Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the Charter
Amendment, which extends the date by which the Company must consummate its initial Business Combination from March 29, 2023 to December
29, 2023, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, provided the sponsor or its designees deposit into the trust
account an amount equal to 0.0378 per share for each public share or 191,666, prior to the commencement of each extension period (the
 Extension ). The Company filed the Charter Amendment with the Office of the Secretary of State of Delaware on March 28, 2023.
At the Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the Charter Amendment extending the date by which the Company must consummate
the initial Business Combination from March 29, 2023 to December 29, 2023, (or such earlier date as determined by the Company s
Board of Directors) (the Extension Amendment Proposal ). Stockholders holding 5,289,280 shares of common stock exercised
their right to redeem their shares for cash at an approximate price of 10.33 per share of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result,
approximately 54,675,740 were removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. 

Following the redemption,
the Company s remaining shares of Class A common stock outstanding were 5,060,720. The Sponsor has continued to make monthly deposits
into the Trust Account of 191,666 for five of the nine monthly extensions, from March 29, 2023 until August 29, 2023. 

The Company also made an
amendment to the Company s investment management trust agreement (the Trust Agreement ), dated as of December 23, 2021,
by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, allowing the Company to extend the business combination
period from March 29, 2023 to December 29, 2023, and updating certain defined terms in the Trust Agreement (the First Amendment
to the Trust Agreement ). 

On September 21, 2023, the
Company held a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the Meeting ). At the Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved
the Charter Amendment, which extends the date by which the Company must consummate its initial Business Combination from December 29,
2023 to December 29, 2024, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, provided the sponsor or its designees deposit
into the trust account an amount equal to 40,000, prior to the commencement of each extension period (the Extension ). The
Company filed the Charter Amendment with the Office of the Secretary of State of Delaware on September 28, 2023. At the Meeting, the Company s
stockholders approved the Charter Amendment extending the date by which the Company must consummate the initial Business Combination from
December 29, 2023 to December 29, 2024, (or such earlier date as determined by the Company s Board of Directors) (the Extension
Amendment Proposal ). Stockholders holding 3,298,311 shares of common stock exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash
at an approximate price of 10.72 per share of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately 35,448,259 were removed from
the Trust Account to pay such holders. 

Following the redemption,
the Company s remaining shares of Class A common stock outstanding were 1,762,409. The Sponsor has made the monthly deposit into
the Trust Account of 40,000 for the monthly extension, from September 29, 2023 through December 29, 2024. 

The Company also made an
amendment to the Company s investment management trust agreement (the Trust Agreement ), dated as of December 23,
2021, as amended by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, allowing the Company to extend the business
combination period from December 29 2023 to December 29, 2024, and updating certain defined terms in the Trust Agreement (the Second
Amendment to the Trust Agreement ). 

The
holders of the Founders Shares have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to
complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the holders of Founder Shares acquire Public Shares in or after
the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails
to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred
underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within
the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available
to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets
remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit 10.00). 

22 

In
order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims
by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed
entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) 10.15 per Public Share or (ii) such
lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than 10.15 per
public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to
pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and
except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an
executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability
for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account
due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the Company s independent registered
accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company
waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

Results of Operations 

As of September 30, 2024,
we have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues. All activity for the period from June 9, 2021 (inception) through
September 30, 2024, relates to our formation and the initial public offering and subsequently, evaluating business combination targets.
We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination, at the earliest. We will generate
non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the initial public offering. 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 1,720 consisting of formation and operating costs of 174,496 and franchise tax of 39,600 and
income tax of 45,927 offset by investment income earned on marketable securities held in Trust of 258,301 and interest earned in operating
account of 2. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 638,764 consisting of formation and operating costs
of 1,171,707 and franchise tax of 96,800 and income tax of 135,819 offset by investment income earned on marketable securities held
in Trust of 765,559 and interest earned in operating account of 3. 

By comparison, for the three
months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 378,293 consisting of formation and operating costs of 187,003, franchise taxes
of 40,000 and income taxes of 85,280, adjusted by investment income earned on marketable securities held in trust account in the amount
of 690,570 and interest earned in operating account of 6. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 1,815,640
consisting of formation and operating costs of 485,134, franchise taxes of 160,000 and income taxes of 170,560, adjusted by investment
income earned on marketable securities held in trust account in the amount of 2,631,309 and interest earned in operating account of 25. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

On December 29, 2021, we
consummated our initial public offering of 10,350,000 units at a price of 10.00 per unit, at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds
of 103.5 million. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate
of 466,150 Units to Singto, LLC, f/k/a Koo Dom Investment, LLC, at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total gross
proceeds of 4,661,500. 

The net cash used in operating
activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 326,948. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had cash of 20,025,986 held in the Trust Accounts. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Accounts, including
any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Accounts (less taxes paid and deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our
initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes. During the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, we withdraw
 286,748 interest earned on the Trust Accounts for tax payment. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part,
as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Accounts will be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had cash of 38,829 outside of the Trust Accounts. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Accounts primarily to complete
our initial business combination. 

In order to fund working
capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with our initial business combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of
our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete
our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close,
we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Accounts to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust
Accounts would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of 10.00 per unit
at the option of the lender, upon consummation of our initial business combination. The units would be identical to the placement units. 

24 

We believe we will need to
raise additional funds following the IPO in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimates
of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial
business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because
we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination, in which
case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. In addition, we intend to target businesses
larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the placement units and may as a result be required to seek
additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we
would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete
our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate
the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional
financing in order to meet our obligations. 

If our estimate of the costs
of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount
necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may
need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant
number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt
in connection with such Business Combination. 

Going Concern Consideration 

The Company expects to incur
significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern
considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an
Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating
an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the requirement
that the Company cease all operations, redeem the Public Shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve raises substantial doubt about the
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty. Management has determined that the Company will need to raise additional funds to meet the working capital needs of
the Company prior to the consummation of an initial business combination or the winding up of the Company as stipulated in the Company s
amended and restated memorandum of association. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements has been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), which contemplate continuation
of the Company as a going concern. 

Extension Payment Deposit 

Following the redemption,
the Company s remaining shares of Class A common stock outstanding were 1,762,409. The Sponsor has continued to make monthly deposits
into the Trust Account of 40,000 for the monthly extensions, from September 29, 2023 through December 29, 2024. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets
or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established
for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. 

We have not entered any off-balance
sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or entered
any non-financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term
debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of
our Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, utilities, out of pocket expenses, and secretarial and administrative support.
We began incurring these fees on December 29, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of
the business combination or our liquidation. 

The underwriters are entitled
to a deferred fee of 3,622,500. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the trust account solely
in the event that we complete a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.

Critical Accounting
Policies 

This management s discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these unaudited condensed
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our unaudited condensed financial statements. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base
our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of unaudited
condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 

Making estimates requires
management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation
or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements, which management considered in formulating
its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates. 

Net Income (Loss)
Per Common Stock 

Net income (loss) per share
is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding for the period. The calculation
of diluted income (loss) per share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering
and warrants issued as components of the Private Placement Units (the Placement Warrants since the exercise of the warrants
are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive. 

Net loss per share, basic
and diluted, for Class A and Class B non-redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the net loss, adjusted for income attributable
to Class A redeemable common stock shares, by the weighted average number of Class A and Class B non-redeemable common stock shares outstanding
for the period. Non-redeemable Class A and Class B common stock shares includes the Founder Shares and non-redeemable common stock shares
as these shares do not have any redemption features and do not participate in the income earned on the Trust Account. 

Class A Common Stock
Subject to Possible Redemption 

All of the Class A common
stock sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public
Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business
Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In accordance
with ASC 480, conditionally redeemable Class A common stock (including shares of Class A common stock that feature redemption rights that
are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s
control) are classified as temporary equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity s
equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although the Company did not specify a maximum redemption threshold,
its charter provides that currently, the Company will not redeem its public shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets
(stockholders equity) to be less than 5,000,001. However, the threshold in its charter would not change the nature of the underlying
shares as redeemable and thus public shares would be required to be disclosed outside of permanent equity. The Company recognizes changes
in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value 10.15 per share) at the end of each reporting period. Such changes are reflected in additional paid-in capital, or in the absence of
additional capital, in accumulated deficit. 

26 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

Through September 30, 2024,
we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. The net proceeds held in the Trust Account have been invested in U.S. government
treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. treasuries.
Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying
Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

We do not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures
are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no
evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and
instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

During the most recently
completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

27 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

None. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

As a smaller reporting company,
as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Factors that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in our final prospectus
for the Initial Public Offering declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2021. Any of these factors could result in a significant
or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that
we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Registration Statement filed with
the SEC on February 14, 2023, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2022 and December 31,
2023. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

We are not currently in compliance with
the Nasdaq Global Market s minimum market value of listed securities MVLS requirement of 50 million. As a result
of being delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market Nasdaq ), the market price and liquidity of our common stock and our ability
to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted. 

As a result of being delisted
from Nasdaq, the Company s securities began trading on the OTC Pink Market effective September 17, 2024. Investors may find
it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy, our common stock on an over-the-counter market, and many
investors may not buy or sell our common stock due to difficulty in accessing over-the-counter markets, policies preventing them from
trading in securities not listed on a national exchange or other reasons. In addition, as a delisted security, our common stock is subject
to SEC rules as a penny stock, which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers. The regulations relating
to penny stocks, coupled with the typically higher cost per trade to the investor of penny stocks due to factors such as broker commissions
generally representing a higher percentage of the price of a penny stock than of a higher-priced stock, may further limit the ability
of investors to trade in our common stock. 

We anticipate that we will
take actions to restore our compliance with the Nasdaq Global Market or another national exchange s listing requirements, but we
can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our Class A common stock to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Market,
stabilize our market price, improve the liquidity of our Class A common stock, prevent our Class A common stock from dropping below the
Nasdaq Global Market s minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with the Nasdaq Global Market or another
national exchange s listing requirements. 

Unstable market and economic conditions
and adverse developments with respect to financial institutions and associated liquidity risk may have serious adverse consequences on
our business, financial condition and stock price. 

The global credit and financial
markets have recently experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability,
declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, inflationary pressure and interest rate changes, increases in unemployment
rates and uncertainty about economic stability. More recently, the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and their placement
into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC created bank-specific and broader financial institution
liquidity risk and concerns. Although the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC jointly confirmed that depositors
at SVB and Signature Bank would continue to have access to their funds, even those in excess of the standard FDIC insurance limits, under
a systemic risk exception, future adverse developments with respect to specific financial institutions or the broader financial services
industry may lead to market-wide liquidity shortages, impair the ability of companies to access near-term working capital needs, and create
additional market and economic uncertainty. There can be no assurance that future credit and financial market instability and a deterioration
in confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn,
liquidity shortages, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the equity and credit
markets deteriorate, or if adverse developments are experienced by financial institutions, it may cause short-term liquidity risk and
also make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing
in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock
price and could require us to delay or abandon our business plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our financial institutions
or other third parties with whom we do business may be adversely affected by the foregoing risks, which may have an adverse effect on
our business. 

28 

A new 1 U.S. federal excise tax could be
imposed on us in connection with future redemptions by us of the Public Shares. 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S.
federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic corporations and certain domestic
subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders
from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at
the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair
market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition,
certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other
guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of, the purpose of the excise tax legislation. The IR Act applies only to repurchases
that occur after December 31, 2022. It is unclear at this time how and to what extent it will apply to future redemptions of the Public
Shares.
