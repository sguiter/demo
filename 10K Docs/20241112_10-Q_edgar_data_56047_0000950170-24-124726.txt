of pension service or (b) had attained age and completed of pension service. Participants non-grandfathered are eligible to receive discretionary 401(k) plan contributions. The Company s pension plan funding strategy is to make annual contributions in amounts equal to or greater than amounts necessary to meet minimum government funding requirements. The plan s benefit obligations are based on a variety of demographic and economic assumptions, and the pension plan assets returns are subject to various risks, including market and interest rate risk, making an accurate prediction of the pension plan contribution difficult. Based on current pension plan assets and market conditions, the Company does not expect to make a contribution to the Kirby pension plan during 2024. On February 14, 2018, with the acquisition of Higman Marine, Inc. and its affiliated companies Higman ), the Company assumed Higman s pension plan for its inland vessel personnel and office staff. On March 27, 2018, the Company amended the Higman pension plan to close it to all new entrants and cease all benefit accruals for periods after May 15, 2018 for all participants. The Company made contributions of million to the Higman pension plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The Company expects to make additional contributions of million during the remainder of 2024. The Company sponsors an unfunded defined benefit health care plan that provides limited postretirement medical benefits to employees who meet minimum age and service requirements, and to eligible dependents. The plan is contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The plan eliminated coverage for future retirees as of December 31, 2011. The Company also has an unfunded defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan SERP that was assumed in an acquisition in 1999. That plan ceased to accrue additional benefits effective January 1, 2000.

 KMT revenues for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months increased 13 and 14 , respectively, and operating income increased 57 and 62 , respectively, compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher term and spot pricing in the inland and coastal markets. The 2024 second and third quarters were modestly impacted by weather and lock delays. The 2023 third quarter was impacted by lower tank barge utilization as a result of Illinois River lock closures and several refinery outages, as well as lower fuel rebills in the inland market. The 2024 and 2023 first quarters were impacted by poor operating conditions including seasonal wind and fog along the Gulf Coast and various lock closures. For both the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 81 and the coastal fleet contributed 19 of KMT revenues. For both the 2023 third quarter and first nine months, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 82 and the coastal fleet contributed 18 of KMT revenues.

(a) Spot and term contract pricing in the coastal market are contingent on various factors including geographic location, vessel capacity, vessel type, and product serviced. 

Effective January 1, 2024, annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of inland multi-year contracts resulted in rate increases on those contracts of approximately 9.5 , excluding fuel. 
 KMT operating margin was 20.5 and 19.2 for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, respectively, compared to 14.8 and 13.5 for the 2023 third quarter and first nine months, respectively. 
 Distribution and Services 
 KDS sells genuine replacement parts, provides service mechanics to overhaul and repair engines, transmissions, reduction gears and related oilfield services equipment, rebuilds component parts or entire diesel engines, transmissions and reduction gears, and related equipment used in oilfield services, marine, power generation, on-highway, backup power and other industrial applications. The Company also rents equipment including generators, industrial compressors, high capacity lift trucks, and refrigeration trailers for use in a variety of industrial markets, manufactures and remanufactures oilfield service equipment, including pressure pumping units, and manufactures cementing and pumping equipment as well as coil tubing and well intervention equipment, electric power generation equipment, and specialized electric distribution and control equipment. 
 For the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, KDS generated 42 and 41 , respectively, of the Company s revenues, of which 85 and 80 , respectively, were generated from service and parts and 15 and 20 , respectively, from manufacturing. The results of KDS are largely influenced by the economic cycles of the oil and gas, marine, power generation, on-highway, and other related industrial markets. 
 18 

KDS revenues for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months increased 3 and decreased 1 , respectively, and operating income decreased 8 and 5 , respectively, compared with the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. In the commercial and industrial market, revenues and operating income increased compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months, as higher business levels in marine repair were partially offset by lower on-highway activity. For the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, the commercial and industrial market contributed 47 and 46 , respectively, of KDS revenues. 
 In the power generation market, revenues and operating income decreased compared to the 2023 third quarter as delays in power generation equipment for oil and gas impacted 2024 third quarter results. Revenues and operating income in the power generation market increased compared to the 2023 first nine months with several large project awards from data center customers as well as other backup power industrial customers. For the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, the power generation market contributed 32 and 35 , respectively, of KDS revenues. 
 In the oil and gas market, revenues increased and operating income declined compared to the 2023 third quarter as deliveries of electric fracturing equipment were partially offset by lower levels of conventional oilfield activity which resulted in decreased demand for new transmissions and parts. Revenues and operating income in the oil and gas market decreased compared to the 2023 first nine months due to lower levels of conventional oilfield activity, partially offset by deliveries of electric fracturing equipment. For the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, the oil and gas market contributed 21 and 19 , respectively, of KDS revenues. 
 KDS operating margin was 8.8 and 8.0 for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, respectively, compared to 9.9 and 8.4 for the 2023 third quarter and first nine months, respectively. 
 Outlook 
 Overall, the Company expects to deliver improved financial results in 2024. In KMT, barge utilization and customer demand remain strong, and rates continue to increase. In KDS, demand for products and services remains steady, and the Company continues to receive new orders in manufacturing. The Company remains mindful of the ever-changing economic landscape related to the impact of continued high interest rates, and possible recessionary headwinds as it moves through 2024 and into 2025. 
 In the inland marine transportation market, the Company s outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024 anticipates continued positive market dynamics with limited new barge construction in the industry and normal seasonal weather impacts and steady demand with slightly lower refinery utilization. With these market conditions, the Company expects its barge utilization rates to remain around the 90 range throughout the remainder of the year and continued improvement in term contract pricing as renewals occur during the final quarter of the year. In coastal marine, market conditions remain favorable with supply and demand in balance across the industry fleet. Steady customer demand is expected to continue in the fourth quarter with barge utilization in the mid-90 range. Coastal marine is expected to be impacted by a number of planned shipyards in the fourth quarter. 
 In the distribution and services segment, the Company anticipates the 2024 fourth quarter will see near-term variability in equipment deliveries due to uncertainty from supply issues, some customer maintenance deferrals, and lower overall levels of activity in oil and gas. In oil and gas, activity levels are lower but have been stabilizing at these lower levels. In commercial and industrial, the demand outlook in marine repair remains steady while on-highway service and repair is somewhat weak in the current environment. In power generation, the Company anticipates continued strong growth in orders as data center demand and the need for backup power is very strong. The Company does anticipate extended lead times for certain OEM products to continue contributing to a volatile delivery schedule of new products in the fourth quarter and into 2025. 
 Acquisitions 
 On May 15, 2024, the Company completed the purchase of 13 inland tank barges, with a total capacity of 347,000 barrels, and two high horsepower towboats from an undisclosed seller for 65.2 million in cash. The 13 tank barges, including three specialty barges, transport petrochemicals and refined products on the Mississippi River System and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The average age of the 13 barges was 15 years. Financing of the equipment acquisition was through borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility. 
 On July 14, 2023, the Company purchased 23 inland tank barges with a total capacity of 265,000 barrels from an undisclosed seller for 37 million in cash. The 23 tank barges transport petrochemicals and refined products on the Mississippi River System and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The average age of the 23 barges was 14 years. Financing of the equipment acquisition was through borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility. 
 The Company purchased four inland tank barges from a leasing company for 0.5 million in cash during the 2023 third quarter. The Company had been leasing the barges prior to the purchase. Financing of the equipment acquisition was through borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility.

KMT revenues for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months increased 13 and 14 , respectively, and operating income increased 57 and 62 , respectively, compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. The increase in revenues for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months was primarily due to higher term and spot pricing in the inland and coastal markets. The 2024 second and third quarters were modestly impacted by weather and lock delays. The 2023 third quarter was impacted by lower tank barge utilization as a result of Illinois River lock closures and several refinery outages, as well as lower fuel rebills in the inland market. The 2024 and 2023 first quarters were impacted by poor operating conditions including seasonal wind and fog along the Gulf Coast and various lock closures. For both the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 81 and the coastal 
 20 

fleet contributed 19 of KMT revenues. For both the 2023 third quarter and first nine months, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 82 and the coastal fleet contributed 18 of KMT revenues. 
 Inland tank barge utilization levels averaged in the low to mid-90 range during both the 2024 first and second quarters, and the 90 range during the 2024 third quarter. Inland tank barge utilization levels averaged in the low to mid-90 range during the 2023 first quarter, the low 90 range during the 2023 second quarter, and the high 80 range during the 2023 third quarter. The 2024 second and third quarters were modestly impacted by weather and lock closures. The 2023 third quarter was impacted by Illinois River lock closures and several refinery outages. The 2024 and 2023 first quarters were impacted by high winds and heavy fog along the Gulf Coast and lock delays. 
 Coastal tank barge utilization levels averaged in the mid to high 90 range during the 2024 first, second and third quarters. Coastal tank barge utilization levels averaged in the mid to high 90 range during both the 2023 first and second quarters, and the mid-90 range during the 2023 third quarter. 
 The petrochemical market, which is the Company s largest market, contributed 52 and 51 of KMT revenues for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, respectively, reflecting increased rates, volumes and utilization from Gulf Coast petrochemical plants as a result of improved economic conditions and a reduced supply of barges across the industry due to a heavier than normal maintenance cycle as compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. 
 The black oil market, which contributed 25 of KMT revenues for both the 2024 third quarter and first nine months reflected stable demand as refinery utilization and production levels of refined petroleum products and fuel oils increased. During the 2024 first nine months, the Company transported crude oil and natural gas condensate produced from major U.S. shale basins along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway with inland vessels and in the Gulf of Mexico with coastal equipment. Additionally, the Company transported volumes of Utica natural gas condensate downriver from the Mid-Atlantic to the Gulf Coast. 
 The refined petroleum products market, which contributed 21 of KMT revenues for both the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, reflected stable volumes in the inland market with steady refinery utilization and product levels as compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. 
 The agricultural chemical market, which contributed 2 and 3 of KMT revenues for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, respectively, reflected stable demand for transportation of both domestically produced and imported products as compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. 
 For the 2024 third quarter, inland operations incurred 2,061 delay days, 33 more than the 1,548 delay days that occurred during the 2023 third quarter. For the 2024 first nine months, inland operations incurred 8,902 delay days, 11 more than the 7,990 delay days that occurred during the 2023 first nine months. Delay days measure the lost time incurred by a tow (towboat and one or more tank barges) during transit when the tow is stopped due to weather, lock conditions, or other navigational factors. Delay days reflected the modest impact of weather and lock delays during the 2024 second and third quarters, Illinois River lock closures during the 2023 third quarter, and poor operating conditions due to heavy wind and fog along the Gulf Coast and lock delays during the 2024 and 2023 first quarters. 
 During both the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, approximately 65 of KMT inland revenues were under term contracts and 35 were spot contract revenues. During both the 2023 third quarter and first nine months, approximately 55 of KMT inland revenues were under term contracts and 45 were spot contract revenues. Inland time charters during the 2024 third quarter and first nine months represented approximately 62 and 61 , respectively, of inland revenues under term contracts compared with 66 and 63 in the 2023 third quarter and first nine months, respectively. During the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, approximately 99 and 98 , respectively, of KMT coastal revenues were under term contracts and 1 and 2 , respectively, were under spot contracts. During the 2023 third quarter and first nine months, approximately 90 and 85 , respectively, of KMT coastal revenues were under term contracts and 10 and 15 , respectively, were under spot contracts. Coastal time charters represented approximately 99 and 98 of coastal revenues under term contracts during the 2024 third quarter and first nine months, respectively, compared to 90 during both the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. Term contracts have contract terms of 12 months or longer, while spot contracts have contract terms of less than 12 months.

(a) Spot and term contract pricing in the coastal market are contingent on various factors including geographic location, vessel capacity, vessel type, and product serviced. 

Effective January 1, 2024, annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of inland multi-year contracts resulted in rate increases on those contracts of approximately 9.5 , excluding fuel. 
 Marine Transportation Costs and Expenses 
 Costs and expenses for both the 2024 third quarter and first nine months increased 6 compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. Costs of sales and operating expenses for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months increased 6 and 7 , respectively, compared with the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. The increase during the 2024 third quarter and first nine months was driven by higher levels of business activity and continued inflationary cost pressures, partially offset by lower fuel costs. 
 The inland marine transportation fleet operated an average of 287 towboats during the 2024 third quarter, of which an average of 71 were chartered, compared to 274 during the 2023 third quarter, of which an average of 55 were chartered. The Company charters in or releases chartered towboats in an effort to balance horsepower needs with current requirements, taking into account variability in demand or anticipated demand, addition or removal of tank barges from the fleet, chartered towboat availability, and weather or water conditions. The Company has historically used chartered towboats for approximately one-fourth of its horsepower requirements. 
 During the 2024 third quarter, inland operations consumed 11.3 million gallons of diesel fuel compared to 11.6 million gallons consumed during the 2023 third quarter. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel consumed during the 2024 third quarter was 2.65 per gallon compared with 2.71 per gallon for the 2023 third quarter. During the 2024 first nine months, inland operations consumed 35.3 million gallons of diesel fuel compared to 35.9 million gallons consumed during the 2023 first nine months. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel consumed during the 2024 first nine months was 2.77 per gallon compared with 2.97 per gallon for the 2023 first nine months. Fuel escalation and de-escalation clauses are typically included in term contracts and are designed to rebate fuel costs when prices decline and recover additional fuel costs when fuel prices rise; however, there is generally a 30 to 120 day delay before contracts are adjusted. Spot contracts do not have escalators for fuel. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months increased 3 and 2 , respectively, compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months as compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months was primarily due to higher business activity levels and continued inflationary cost pressures, which was partially offset by lower legal costs. Both the 2024 third quarter and first nine months were also impacted by salary and wage increases that went into effect July 1, 2024. 
 Marine Transportation Operating Income and Operating Margin 
 KMT operating income for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months increased 57 and 62 , respectively, compared with the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. The 2024 third quarter operating margin was 20.5 compared with 14.8 for the 2023 third quarter. The 2024 first nine months operating margin was 19.2 compared with 13.5 for the 2023 first nine months. The increases in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to higher term and spot contract pricing in the inland and coastal markets as a result of improving business activity levels, high utilization and a reduced supply of barges across the industry due to a heavier than normal maintenance cycle.

KDS revenues for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months increased 3 and decreased 1 , respectively, compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. In the commercial and industrial market, revenues increased compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months, as higher business levels in marine repair were partially offset by lower on-highway activity. Operating income in the commercial and industrial market was up compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months mainly due to sales mix. In the power generation market, revenues and operating income decreased compared to the 2023 third quarter as delays in power generation equipment for oil and gas impacted 2024 third quarter results. Revenues and operating income in the power generation market increased compared to the 2023 first nine months with several large project awards from data center customers as well as other backup power industrial customers. In the oil and gas market, revenues increased and operating income declined compared to the 2023 third quarter as deliveries of electric fracturing equipment were offset by lower levels of conventional oilfield activity which resulted in decreased demand for new transmissions and parts. Revenues and operating income in the oil and gas market decreased compared to the 2023 first nine months due to lower levels of conventional oilfield activity, partially offset by deliveries of electric fracturing equipment. 
 Distribution and Services Costs and Expenses 
 Costs and expenses for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months increased 4 and were flat, respectively, compared with the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. Costs of sales and operating expenses for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months increased 2 and decreased 3 , respectively, compared with the 2023 third quarter and first nine months, reflecting deliveries of electric fracturing equipment and lower on-highway and conventional oilfield activity. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months increased 9 and 5 , respectively, compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months, primarily due to continued inflationary cost pressures and salary and wage increases that went into effect July 1, 2024. 
 23 

Depreciation and amortization for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months increased 78 and 86 , respectively, compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. The increase was primarily due to capital additions during the 2023 second half and 2024 first nine months including additions to the equipment rental fleet. 
 Distribution and Services Operating Income and Operating Margin 
 KDS operating income for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months decreased 8 and 5 , respectively, compared with the 2023 third quarter and first nine months. The 2024 third quarter operating margin was 8.8 compared to 9.9 for the 2023 third quarter. The 2024 first nine months operating margin was 8.0 compared to 8.4 for the 2023 first nine months. The results reflect lower on-highway and conventional oilfield activity partially offset by increased power generation in industrial end markets and marine repair activity. 
 General Corporate Expenses 
 General corporate expenses for the 2024 third quarter and first nine months decreased compared to the 2023 third quarter and first nine months primarily due to lower legal and insurance costs. The 2023 first nine months also included costs related to strategic review and shareholder engagement. 
 Gain on Disposition of Assets 
 The Company reported a net gain on disposition of assets of 1.6 million for the 2024 third quarter and 1.5 million for the 2023 third quarter. The Company reported a net gain on disposition of assets of 2.2 million for the 2024 first nine months and 4.2 million for the 2023 first nine months. The net gains were primarily from sales of marine transportation equipment.

Current assets as of September 30, 2024 increased 3 compared with December 31, 2023. Trade accounts receivable increased 3 primarily due to higher business activity levels in KMT. Inventories net decreased by 4 primarily due to strong deliveries of power generation units and oilfield service equipment during the 2024 first nine months. 
 Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, at September 30, 2024 increased 3 compared with December 31, 2023. The increase reflected 244.3 million of capital additions (net of a decrease in accrued capital expenditures of 1.7 million) and a 65.2 million equipment acquisition in the 2024 second quarter, partially offset by 171.3 million of depreciation expense and 13.9 million of property disposals more fully described under Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures below. 
 Operating lease right-of-use assets as of September 30, 2024 increased 7 compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to new leases acquired during the 2024 first nine months, partially offset by lease amortization expense. 
 Other intangibles, net, as of September 30, 2024 decreased 15 compared with December 31, 2023, due to amortization during the 2024 first nine months. 
 Other assets as of September 30, 2024 decreased 11 compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to amortization of drydock expenditures, partially offset by additional deferred major maintenance drydock expenditures incurred during the 2024 first nine months. 
 Current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 increased 3 compared with December 31, 2023. Income taxes payable increased by 20.2 million primarily due to timing of federal income tax payments. Accounts payable decreased 8 primarily due to timing of KDS inventory purchases and KMT shipyard payments. Accrued liabilities decreased 5 primarily from payment during the 2024 first quarter of employee incentive compensation accrued during 2023. Deferred revenue increased 25 primarily due to deposits on equipment expected to be shipped later in 2024 and 2025 in KDS. 
 Long-term debt, net less current portion, as of September 30, 2024 decreased 4 compared with December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting reduced borrowings under the 2027 Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Deferred income taxes as of September 30, 2024 increased 6 compared with December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting the deferred tax provision of 38.7 million. 
 Total equity as of September 30, 2024 increased 4 compared with December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the net earnings attributable to Kirby of 243.9 million, amortization of share-based compensation of 12.8 million, and stock option exercises of 8.4 million, partially offset by treasury stock purchases of 141.3 million and tax withholdings of 5.4 million on RSU vestings.

On July 29, 2022, the Company entered into the 2027 Credit Agreement with a group of commercial banks, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the administrative agent bank that allows for a 500 million 2027 Revolving Credit Facility and a 250 million 2027 Term Loan with a maturity date of July 29, 2027. In October 2024, the Company repaid 10.0 million under the 2027 Term Loan prior to scheduled maturities. As a result, no repayments are required until September 30, 2025. Future repayments under the 2027 Term Loan are excluded from short term liabilities because the Company intends to use availability under the 2027 Revolving Credit Facility to repay these amounts upon maturity. Outstanding letters of credit under the 2027 Revolving Credit Facility were 6,000 and available borrowing capacity was 495.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 On February 3, 2022, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement for the 2033 Notes with a group of institutional investors, consisting of 60 million Series A Notes and 240 million Series B Notes, each due January 19, 2033. The Series A Notes were issued on October 20, 2022, and the Series B Notes were issued on January 19, 2023. No principal payments will be required until maturity. 
 The Company has a 15 million Credit Line with Bank of America for short-term liquidity needs and letters of credit, with a maturity date of June 30, 2026. Outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Line were 6.8 million and available borrowing capacity was 8.2 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under its debt instruments. For additional information about the Company s debt instruments, see Note 5, Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) as well as Note 5, Long-Term Debt, in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures 
 The Company generated positive operating cash flows during the 2024 first nine months with net cash provided by operating activities of 509.1 million compared with 324.2 million for the 2023 first nine months, a 57 increase. The improvement in operating cash flows was due to higher revenues and operating income in KMT and a favorable change in inventories and deferred revenues, primarily due to timing of shipments and customer deposits. The 2023 first nine months includes the receipt of the Internal Revenue Service refund of 70.4 million plus accrued interest in April 2023. Increases in KMT revenues and operating income were driven by higher term and spot contract pricing during the 2024 first nine months. During the 2024 and 2023 first nine months, the Company generated cash of 13.8 million and 21.8 million, respectively, from proceeds from the disposition of assets, and 8.4 million and 3.4 million, respectively, from proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 For the 2024 first nine months, cash generated was used for capital expenditures of 246.0 million, including 166.9 million associated with marine maintenance capital and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facility improvements, as well as 79.1 million for growth spending in both segments. The growth spending is related to inland equipment construction and equipment for use in a variety of KDS markets including electric fracturing equipment, generators, and other related equipment.

Treasury Stock Purchases 
 During the 2024 first nine months, the Company purchased 1,354,105 shares of its common stock for 141.3 million, at an average price of 104.33 per share. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 and through November 8, 2024, the Company purchased an additional 138,085 shares of its common stock for 16.0 million, at an average price of 115.62 per share. As of November 8, 2024, the Company had approximately 3.0 million shares available under its existing purchase authorizations. Historically, treasury stock purchases have been financed through operating cash flows and borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility. The Company is authorized to purchase its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange and in privately negotiated transactions. When purchasing its common stock, the Company is subject to price, trading volume, and other market considerations. Shares purchased may be used for reissuance upon the exercise of stock options or the granting of other forms of incentive compensation, in future acquisitions for stock, or for other appropriate corporate purposes. For more information about stock purchases in the 2024 third quarter, see Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Liquidity 
 Funds generated from operations are available for acquisitions, capital expenditure projects, common stock purchases, repayments of borrowings, and for other corporate and operating requirements. In addition to net cash flows provided by operating activities, as of November 8, 2024 the Company also had cash and cash equivalents of 108.5 million, availability of 500.0 million under its 2027 Revolving Credit Facility, and 8.2 million available under its Credit Line. 
 Neither the Company, nor any of its subsidiaries, is obligated on any debt instrument, swap agreement, or any other financial instrument or commercial contract which has a rating trigger, except for the pricing grid on its 2027 Credit Agreement. 
 The Company expects to continue to fund expenditures for acquisitions, capital construction projects, common stock purchases, repayment of borrowings, and for other operating requirements from a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operating activities, and available financing arrangements. 
 The 2027 Revolving Credit Facility s commitment is in the amount of 500 million and matures July 29, 2027. The 500 million 4.2 senior unsecured notes do not mature until March 1, 2028 and require no prepayments. The 2033 Notes do not mature until January 19, 2033 and require no prepayments. The 2027 Term Loan is subject to quarterly installments, beginning September 30, 2025, in increasing percentages of the original principal amount of the loan, with the remaining unpaid balance of approximately 43.8 million payable on July 29, 2027, assuming no prepayments. The 2027 Term Loan is prepayable, in whole or in part, without penalty. 
 There are numerous factors that may negatively impact the Company s cash flows in 2024. For a list of significant risks and uncertainties that could impact cash flows, see Note 13, Contingencies and Commitments, of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited), and Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 14, Contingencies and Commitments, in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Amounts available under the Company s existing financial arrangements are subject to the Company continuing to meet the covenants of the credit facilities as described in Note 5, Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) as well as Note 5, Long-Term Debt, in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The Company has issued guaranties or obtained standby letters of credit and performance bonds supporting performance by the Company and its subsidiaries of contractual or contingent legal obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries incurred in the ordinary course of business. The aggregate notional value of these instruments is 31.5 million at September 30, 2024, including 11.6 million in letters of credit and 19.9 million in performance bonds. All of these instruments have an expiration date within two years. The Company does not believe demand for payment under these instruments is likely and expects no material cash outlays to occur in connection with these instruments. 
 KMT term contracts typically contain fuel escalation clauses, or the customer pays for the fuel. However, there is generally a 30 to 120 day delay before contracts are adjusted depending on the specific terms of the contract. In general, the fuel escalation clauses are effective over the long-term in allowing the Company to recover changes in fuel costs due to fuel price changes. However, the short-term effectiveness of the fuel escalation clauses can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, specific terms of the fuel escalation formulas, fuel price volatility, navigating conditions, tow sizes, trip routing, and the location of loading and discharge ports that may result in the Company over or under recovering its fuel costs. The Company s spot contract rates generally reflect current fuel prices at the time the contract is signed but do not have escalators for fuel. 
 The Company has certain mechanisms designed to help mitigate the impacts of rising costs. For example, KMT has long-term contracts which generally contain cost escalation clauses whereby certain costs, including fuel as noted above, can be largely passed through to its customers. Spot contract rates include the cost of fuel and are subject to market volatility. In KDS, the cost of major components for large manufacturing orders is secured with suppliers at the time a customer order is finalized, which somewhat limits exposure to inflation. The repair portion of KDS is based on prevailing current market rates.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company s exposure to market risk has not changed materially since December 31, 2023. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures . The Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act )), as of September 30, 2024, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
