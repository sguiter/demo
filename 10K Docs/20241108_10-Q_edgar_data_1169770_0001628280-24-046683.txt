million equity capital raise. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting, therefore, PacWest Bancorp was deemed the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, even though Banc of California, Inc. was the legal acquirer. The Merger was an all-stock transaction and has been accounted for as a business combination.

In addition, Banc of California, Inc.'s reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflect PacWest Bancorp financial results only on a standalone basis until the closing of the Merger on November 30, 2023, and results of the combined company for the month of December 2023. The number of shares issued and outstanding, earnings per share, and all references to share quantities or metrics of Banc of California, Inc. have been retrospectively restated to reflect the equivalent number of shares issued in the Merger as the Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger. Under the reverse merger method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of legacy Banc of California, Inc. as of November 30, 2023 were recorded at their respective fair values.

In connection with the issuance of the credit-linked notes on September 29, 2022, legacy Pacific Western Bank established a correspondent bank account at a third party financial institution as the collateral account for the credit-linked notes. The repayment of principal on the credit-linked notes is secured by this collateral account, which had a balance of million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. Starting in the second quarter of 2023, we began to pledge cash to secure the standby letters of credit that we have issued on behalf of our customers.

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had recorded an allowance for credit losses on securities available-for-sale of on one corporate debt security of other financial institutions that were downgraded to below investment grade by external credit agencies. Except for the corporate debt security noted, we believe there was no credit impairment and the decline in fair value of our securities since acquisition was primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and credit spreads. We do not currently intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery and the Company has therefore recorded the unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) ("AOCI"). 
 As of September 30, 2024, securities available-for-sale with a fair value of million were pledged as collateral solely for public deposits.

 The securities that were in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024, were considered impaired and required further review to determine if the unrealized losses were credit-related. We concluded the unrealized losses were a result of the level of market interest rates relative to the types of securities and pricing changes caused by shifting supply and demand dynamics and not a result of downgraded credit ratings or other indicators of deterioration of the underlying issuers' ability to repay. We also considered the seniority of the tranches and U.S. government agency guarantees, if any, to assess whether an unrealized loss was credit-related. Accordingly, we determined the unrealized losses were not credit-related and recognized the unrealized losses in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net" of "Stockholders' equity" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 CMBS, CMOs, and MBS have contractual maturity dates, but require periodic payments based upon scheduled amortization terms. Actual principal collections on these securities usually occur more rapidly than the scheduled amortization terms because of prepayments made by obligors of the underlying loan collateral.

 Credit losses on HTM securities are recorded at the time of purchase, acquisition, or when the Company designates securities as held-to-maturity. Credit losses on HTM securities are representative of current expected credit losses that may be incurred over the life of the investment. Accrued interest receivable on HTM securities, which is included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, is excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses. HTM U.S. treasury securities and agency-backed MBS securities are considered to have no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. The change in fair value in the HTM private label CMBS portfolio is solely driven by changes in interest rates. The Company has no knowledge of any underlying credit issues and the cash flows underlying the debt securities have not changed and are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates and, thus, there is no related ACL for this portfolio. The underlying bonds in the Company s HTM municipal securities and HTM corporate debt securities portfolios are evaluated for credit losses in conjunction with management s estimate of the allowance for credit losses based primarily on credit ratings.

 Leases Receivable 
 We provide equipment financing to our customers primarily with operating and direct financing leases. For direct financing leases, lease receivables are recorded on the balance sheet but the leased equipment is not, although we generally retain legal title to the leased equipment until the end of each lease. Direct financing leases are stated at the net amount of minimum lease payments receivable, plus any unguaranteed residual value, less the amount of unearned income and net acquisition discount at the reporting date. Direct lease origination costs are amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the leases. Direct financing leases are subject to our accounting for allowance for loan and lease losses. See Note 8. Leases for information regarding operating leases where we are the lessor.

 million at September 30, 2024. The Company has also hedged the interest rate risk and foreign currency risk on million of subordinated debt utilizing a combined cross currency swap/interest rate swap, which has had the effect of hedging the foreign currency risk and fixing the Euribor-based floating rate instrument at a fixed rate of through July 2025. The outputs from the Company's NII simulation analysis and EVE modeling reflect the impact of these interest rate/currency swaps, however, the impact is not material. Our derivatives are carried at fair value and recorded in "Other assets" or "Accrued interest payable and other liabilities," as appropriate, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, the changes in fair value of our derivatives and the related fees are recognized in "Noninterest income - other" in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings (loss). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, changes in fair value and fees recorded in noninterest income in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings (loss) were immaterial. 
 Cash flow hedges in the table below included pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating million, five year terms, and varying maturity dates throughout 2028. These swap contracts were entered into with institutional counterparties to hedge against variability in cash flow attributable to interest rate risk on a portion of the Company's borrowings. Also included in cash flow hedges in the table below are pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating million, with forward-starting dates in 2024 and varying maturity dates throughout 2025. These swap contracts were entered into with institutional counterparties to hedge against variability in cash flow attributable to interest rate risk on future issuance of brokered deposits. The cash flow hedges were deemed highly effective at inception and thereafter. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the portion of changes in fair value considered to be highly effective are reported as a component of AOCI on the condensed consolidated balance sheets until the related cash flows from the hedged items are recognized in earnings. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the cash flow hedges represented a net liability of million, related to which a loss of million (net of tax) was included in AOCI. The estimated amount to be reclassified in the next 12 months out of AOCI into earnings is million. 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments: Interest rate contracts Foreign exchange contracts Equity warrant assets Total contracts 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we closed out a portion of our pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap contracts classified as cash flow hedges with notional amounts of million. At September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of million (net of tax) deferred in AOCI related to closed out cash flow hedges. Amounts deferred in AOCI from closed out cash flow hedges will be amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis through the original maturity dates of the hedges as long as the hedged forecasted transactions continue to be expected to occur. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense from the amortization of closed out cash flow hedges totaled .

NOTE 11. 
 Standby letters of credit Total 
 The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement that the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. 
 Commitments to extend credit are contractual agreements to lend to our customers when customers are in compliance with their contractual credit agreements and when customers have contractual availability to borrow under such agreements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The estimated exposure to loss from these commitments is included in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments, which amounted to million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. We provide standby letters of credit in conjunction with several of our lending arrangements and property lease obligations. Most guarantees expire within one year from the date of issuance. If a borrower defaults on its commitments subject to any letter of credit issued under these arrangements, we would be required to meet the borrower's financial obligation but would seek repayment of that financial obligation from the borrower. In some cases, borrowers have pledged cash and investment securities as collateral under these arrangements. 
 In addition, we invest in SBICs that call for capital contributions up to an amount specified in the partnership agreements, and in CRA-related loan pools. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had commitments to contribute capital to these entities totaling million and million.

 Legal Matters 
 In the ordinary course of our business, the Company is party to various legal actions, which we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. The outcome of such legal actions and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict. In the opinion of management, based upon currently available information, any resulting liability, in addition to amounts already accrued, and taking into consideration insurance which may be applicable, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements or operations. The range of any reasonably possible liabilities is also not significant.

NOTE 12. 
 Fair Value Option for Certain Debt Liabilities 
 The Company has elected the fair value option for the credit-linked notes issued in September 2022. The Company elected the fair value option because these exposures are considered to be structured notes, which are financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives. The notes are linked to the credit risk of an approximately billion reference pool of previously purchased single-family residential mortgage loans. The principal balance of the credit-linked notes was million at September 30, 2024. The carrying value of the credit-linked notes at September 30, 2024 was the estimated fair value of million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense on the credit-linked notes totaled million and million, respectively, and are recorded in "Interest expense - borrowings" on the condensed consolidated statements of earnings (loss).) ) Changes in fair value - other comprehensive (income) loss ) )

 Limitations 
 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time and are based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect income taxes or any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on what management believes to be reasonable judgments regarding expected future cash flows, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimated fair values are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Since the fair values have been estimated as of September 30, 2024, the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different.

 Restricted Stock 
 Restricted stock amortization totaled million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and million and million nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Such amounts are included in "Compensation expense" on the condensed consolidated statements of earnings (loss). The amount of unrecognized compensation expense related to all unvested RSUs, TRSAs, and PRSUs as of September 30, 2024 totaled million . 
 Time-Based Restricted Stock Awards 
 At September 30, 2024, there were shares of unvested RSUs outstanding pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2018 Plan. At September 30, 2024, there were s h ar es of unvested TRSAs outstanding pursuant to the PacWest 2017 Plan. The RSUs and TRSAs generally vest over a service period of three or from the date of the grant or immediately upon death of an employee. Compensation expense related to RSUs and TRSAs is based on the fair value of the underlying stock on the award date and is recognized over the vesting period using the straight line method. TRSAs were assumed by the Company in connection with the Merger and continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule of the awards. 
 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units 
 At September 30, 2024, there were units of unvested PRSUs that have been granted. Compensation expense related to PRSUs is based on the fair value of the underlying stock on the award date and is amortized over the vesting period using the straight-line method unless it is determined that: (1) attainment of the financial metrics is less than probable, in which case a portion of the amortization is suspended, or (2) attainment of the financial metrics is improbable, in which case a portion of the previously recognized amortization is reversed and also suspended. Annual PRSU expense may vary during the performance period based upon changes in management's estimate of the number of shares that may ultimately vest. In the case where the performance target for the PRSUs is based on a market condition (such as total shareholder return), the amortization is neither reversed nor suspended if it is subsequently determined that the attainment of the performance target is less than probable or improbable and the employee continues to meet the service requirement of the award.

 fluctuations in the demand for loans, and fluctuations in commercial and residential real estate values in our market area; 
 the quality and composition of our securities portfolio; 
 our ability to develop and maintain a strong core deposit base, including among our venture banking clients, or other low cost funding sources necessary to fund our activities particularly in a rising or high interest rate environment;

 results of examinations by regulatory authorities of the Company and the possibility that any such regulatory authority may, among other things, limit our business activities, restrict our ability to invest in certain assets, refrain from issuing an approval or non-objection to certain capital or other actions, increase our allowance for credit losses, result in write-downs of asset values, restrict our ability or that of our bank subsidiary to pay dividends, or impose fines, penalties or sanctions; 
 legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect our business, including changes in tax laws and policies, accounting policies and practices, privacy laws, and regulatory capital or other rules;

 Presentation of Results PacWest Bancorp Merger 
 On November 30, 2023, PacWest Bancorp merged with and into Banc of California, Inc. (the Merger or "PACW Merger"), with Banc of California, Inc. continuing as the surviving legal corporation and Banc of California, Inc. concurrently closed a 400 million equity capital raise. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting, therefore, PacWest Bancorp was deemed the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, even though Banc of California, Inc. was the legal acquirer. The Merger was an all-stock transaction and has been accounted for as a business combination. Banc of California, Inc.'s financial results for all periods ended prior to November 30, 2023 reflect PacWest Bancorp results only on a standalone basis. In addition, Banc of California, Inc.'s reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflect PacWest Bancorp financial results only on a standalone basis until the closing of the Merger on November 30, 2023, and results of the combined company for the month of December 2023. The number of shares issued and outstanding, earnings per share, and all references to share quantities or metrics of Banc of California, Inc. have been retrospectively restated to reflect the equivalent number of shares issued in the Merger as the Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger. Under the reverse merger method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of legacy Banc of California, Inc. as of November 30, 2023 were recorded at their respective fair values.

Overview 
 Banc of California, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was incorporated in March 2002 and serves as the holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, Banc of California (the Bank ), a California state-chartered bank and member of the FRB. When we refer to the parent or the holding company," we are referring to Banc of California, Inc., the parent company, on a stand-alone basis. When we refer to we, us, our, or the Company, we are referring to Banc of California, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries including the Bank, collectively. 
 The Bank is a relationship-based community bank focused on providing business banking and treasury management services to small, middle-market, and venture-backed businesses. The Bank offers a broad range of loan and lease and deposit products and services through 80 full-service branches located throughout California and in Durham, North Carolina and Denver, Colorado, and loan production offices around the country. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had total assets of 33.4 billion, including 23.6 billion of total loans and leases, net of deferred fees, 2.3 billion of securities available-for-sale, 2.3 billion of securities held-to-maturity, and 2.3 billion of interest-earning deposits in financial institutions compared to 38.5 billion of total assets at December 31, 2023, including 25.6 billion of total loans and leases, net of deferred fees, 2.3 billion of securities available-for-sale, 2.3 billion securities held-to-maturity, and 5.2 billion of interest-earning deposits in financial institutions. The 5.1 billion decrease in total assets since year-end was due mainly to a 2.9 billion decrease in interest-earning deposits in financial institutions and a 2.1 billion decrease in total loans and leases, net of deferred fees. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had total liabilities of 29.9 billion , including total deposits of 26.8 billion and borrowings of 1.6 billion , compared to 35.1 billion of total liabilities at December 31, 2023, including 30.4 billion of total deposits and 2.9 billion borrowings. The 5.2 billion decrease in total liabilities since year-end was due mainly to a 3.6 billion decrease in deposits and a 1.3 billion decrease in borrowings. 
 The Company had total stockholders' equity of 3.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and 3.4 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was due mainly to a 104.0 million decrease in in the unrealized after-tax net loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss and net earnings of 70.0 million, offset partially by common and preferred stock dividends of 80.2 million. Our consolidated common equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios were 10.46 , 12.88 , and 17.00 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Recent Events 
 Civic Loan Sale 
 On July 18, 2024, the Bank closed the sale of 1.95 billion of Civic business-purpose residential loans which had been moved to held for sale at LOCOM of 1.91 billion during the second quarter of 2024. The loan sale generated net proceeds of 1.91 billion and provided liquidity and capital to support the repositioning of approximately 742 million of securities and pay down higher-cost brokered deposits and borrowings, as discussed further below. 
 PacWest Bancorp Merger 
 On November 30, 2023, Banc of California, Inc. completed the Merger, pursuant to which PacWest Bancorp merged with and into Banc of California, Inc., with Banc of California, Inc. continuing as the surviving legal corporation and, as of December 1, 2023, Banc of California, N.A. merged into Pacific Western Bank with Pacific Western Bank continuing under the Banc of California name and brand as the Bank. Concurrent with the completion of the Merger, Banc of California, Inc. also completed its 400 million equity raise from affiliates of funds managed by Warburg Pincus LLC and certain investment vehicles sponsored, managed, or advised by Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and its affiliates. The stock issued by Banc of California, Inc. as consideration in the Merger totaled approximately 663 million. 
 The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting, therefore, PacWest Bancorp was deemed the accounting acquirer, even though Banc of California, Inc. was the legal acquirer. We recorded the legacy Banc of California, Inc. acquired assets and assumed liabilities, both tangible and intangible, at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in goodwill of 216.8 million. The Bank is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, and operates 80 branches located throughout California, and in North Carolina and Colorado. We completed the Merger to, among other things, enhance our scale and presence in California and augment and diversify our sources of revenue. 

72 

Balance Sheet Repositioning 
 In connection with the Merger, we implemented our previously announced balance sheet repositioning strategy. From the announcement of the Merger on July 25, 2023, through the end of the year, the combined company, legacy PacWest Bancorp and legacy Banc of California, Inc., sold assets totaling 6.1 billion and completed the paydown of 8.6 billion of high-cost liabilities, which improved the mix of earning assets and reduced the amount of higher-cost funding. The sold assets included 3.9 billion of securities from both the legacy Banc of California, Inc. and PacWest Bancorp portfolios, and 1.5 billion of single-family loans and 0.7 billion of multi-family loans from the legacy Banc of California, Inc. portfolios. The liabilities that were paid down included 4.7 billion of borrowings and 3.9 billion of brokered deposits from both legacy entities. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we closed on the sale of 1.95 billion of Civic loans which had been moved to held for sale during the second quarter of 2024. The loan sale generated net proceeds of 1.91 billion, which provided capital and liquidity to support the repositioning of a portion of the available-for-sale securities portfolio and pay down higher-cost brokered deposits and borrowings. We sold 742 million of securities with a weighted average yield of 2.94 resulting in a pre-tax loss of 60 million and purchased 724 million of similar quality securities with a weighted average yield of 5.65 . The liabilities that were paid off included 1.85 billion of brokered deposits with an average cost of 5.35 at the time of retirement and the remaining 545 million in Bank Term Funding Program balance with a rate of 5.40 . We replaced a portion of these higher-cost fundings with the addition of a 500 million long-term FHLB advance with a rate of 3.18 . These balance sheet repositioning actions that we executed during the quarter resulted in net interest margin expansion and improved both our capital and liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, the repositioning as contemplated as a result of the Merger has been largely completed. 
 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 Among other factors, our operating results generally depend on the following key performance indicators: 
 The Level of Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the excess of interest earned on our interest-earning assets over the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is net interest income (annualized if related to a quarterly period) expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Tax equivalent net interest income is net interest income increased by an adjustment for tax-exempt interest on certain loans and investment securities based on a 21 federal statutory tax rate. Tax equivalent net interest margin is calculated as tax equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. 
 Net interest income is affected by changes in both interest rates and the volume of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our primary interest-earning assets are loans and investment securities, and our primary interest-bearing liabilities are deposits and borrowings. While our deposit balances will fluctuate depending on our customers liquidity and cash flow, market conditions, and competitive pressures, we seek to minimize the impact of these variances by attracting a high percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits. Our current priorities are to increase customer deposits to replace brokered deposits, which will reduce our interest expense. 
 Loan and Lease Production 
 We actively seek new lending opportunities under an array of lending products. Our lending activities include real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land loans, commercial loans and leases, and a small amount of consumer lending. Our commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans are secured by a range of property types. Our commercial loans and leases portfolio is diverse and generally includes various asset-secured loans, equipment-secured loans and leases, venture capital loans to support venture capital firms operations and the operations of entrepreneurial and venture-backed companies during the various phases of their early life cycles, and secured business loans. 
 Our loan origination process emphasizes credit quality. On occasion, to augment our internal loan production, we have purchased loans such as multi-family loans from other banks, private student loans from third-party lenders, and single-family residential mortgage loans. These loan purchases help us manage the concentrations in our portfolio as they diversify the geographic risk, interest-rate risk, credit risk, and product composition of our loan portfolio. Achieving net loan growth is subject to many factors, including maintaining strict credit standards, competition from other lenders, and borrowers that opt to prepay loans. 

73 

The Magnitude of Credit Losses 
 We emphasize credit quality in originating and monitoring our loans and leases, and we measure our success by the levels of our classified loans and leases, nonaccrual loans and leases, and net charge-offs. We maintain an allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, which is the sum of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. Provisions for credit losses are charged to operations as and when needed for both on and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Loans and leases that are deemed uncollectable are charged off and deducted from the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries on loans and leases previously charged off are added to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The provision for credit losses on the loan and lease portfolio is based on our allowance methodology, which considers the impact of assumptions and is reflective of historical experience, economic forecasts viewed to be reasonable and supportable by management, the current loan and lease composition, and relative credit risks known as of the balance sheet date. For originated and acquired credit-deteriorated loans, a provision for credit losses may be recorded to reflect credit deterioration after the origination date or after the acquisition date, respectively. 
 We regularly review loans and leases to determine whether there has been any deterioration in credit quality resulting from borrower operations or changes in collateral value or other factors which may affect collectability of our loans and leases. Changes in economic conditions, such as the rate of economic growth, the unemployment rate, rate of inflation, increases in the general level of interest rates, declines in real estate values, changes in commodity prices, and adverse conditions in borrowers businesses, could negatively impact our borrowers and cause us to adversely classify loans and leases. An increase in classified loans and leases generally results in increased provisions for credit losses and an increased allowance for credit losses. Any deterioration in the commercial real estate market may lead to increased provisions for credit losses because our loans are concentrated in commercial real estate loans. 
 The Level of Noninterest Expense 
 Our noninterest expense includes fixed and controllable overhead, the largest components of which are compensation expense, customer related expense, and occupancy expense. Customer related expenses are primarily earnings credit rate payments to customers and are mostly driven by the Homeowners Association ("HOA") business. It also includes costs that tend to vary based on the volume of activity, such as loan and lease production and the number and complexity of foreclosed assets. Additionally, noninterest expense included acquisition, integration and reorganization costs related to the Merger and a goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2023. We measure success in controlling both fixed and variable costs through monitoring of the ratio of noninterest expense to average total assets. 
 The following table presents the calculation of our ratio of noninterest expense to average total assets and for the periods indicated:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the condensed consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results may ultimately differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and on our results of operations for the reporting periods. 
 Our accounting policies and estimates are fundamental to understanding the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. We identify critical policies and estimates as those that require management to make particularly difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies and estimates relate to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment, business combinations, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the realization of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Form 10-K. 

75 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company s operational performance and to enhance investors overall understanding of such financial performance. This disclosure should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP. The methodology for determining these non-GAAP measures may differ among companies and may not be comparable. We used the following non-GAAP measures in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q: 
 Return on average tangible common equity ("ROATCE"), tangible common equity ratio, and tangible book value per common share: Given that the use of these measures is prevalent among banking regulators, investors, and analysts, we disclose them in addition to the related GAAP measures of return on average equity, equity to assets ratio, and book value per common share, respectively. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the GAAP measures are presented in the following tables for and as of the periods presented.

Third Quarter of 2024 Compared to Second Quarter of 2024 
 Net loss available to common and equivalent stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was 1.2 million, or a loss of 0.01 per diluted common share, compared to a net earnings available to common and equivalent stockholders for the second quarter of 2024 of 20.4 million, or 0.12 per diluted common share. The 21.5 million decrease in net earnings available to common and equivalent stockholders from the second quarter of 2024 was due mainly to lower noninterest income of 45.2 million, offset partially offset by higher net interest income of 2.7 million, lower noninterest expense of 7.4 million, lower provision for credit losses of 2.0 million and lower income tax expense of 11.6 million. The decrease in noninterest income was due mainly to a 59.9 million loss on the sale of 741.8 million of securities in the third quarter of 2024, offset partially by a 7.5 million increase in other income and a 5.7 million increase in leased equipment income. Net interest income was higher in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to lower interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, offset partially by lower interest income on interest-earning assets. The decrease in noninterest expense was due mainly to decreases of 13.7 million in insurance and assessments expense and 5.8 million in other expense, offset partially by a 12.1 million increase in acquisition, integration and reorganization costs. The decrease in income tax expense was due to lower pre-tax income for the third quarter compared to the second quarter and a lower effective tax rate of 23.7 for the third quarter compared to 32.0 for the second quarter. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net earnings available to common and equivalent stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 40.1 million, or 0.24 per diluted common share, compared to a net loss available to common and equivalent stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 1.4 billion, or a loss of 18.61 per diluted common share. The 1.5 billion increase in net earnings available to common and equivalent stockholders was due mainly to lower noninterest expense of 1.5 billion, higher noninterest income of 96.0 million and higher net interest income of 94.7 million, offset partially by higher provision for credit losses of 25.0 million and higher income tax expense of 163.7 million . The decrease in noninterest expense was due, in part, to a 1.38 billion goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in noninterest income was due mainly to a decrease in the loss on sale of loans and leases of 158.4 million, offset partially by an increase in the loss on sale of securities of 59.9 million. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to lower interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, offset partially by lower interest income on interest-earning assets. The increase in income tax expense was due to the income tax expense recorded on earnings before taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an income tax benefit recorded on a net loss before income taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Third Quarter of 2024 Compared to Second Quarter of 2024 
 Net interest income increased by 2.7 million to 232.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 229.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 due to lower interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, offset partially by lower interest income on interest-earning assets. 

82 

Average interest-earning assets decreased by 1.4 billion to 31.6 billion for the third quarter due mainly to the sale in July 2024 of 1.95 billion of Civic loans which had been moved to held for sale during the second quarter. The proceeds of the sale provided liquidity and capital to support the repositioning of approximately 742 million of securities and pay down higher-cost brokered deposits and borrowings. The net interest margin increased by 13 basis points to 2.93 for the third quarter compared to 2.80 for the second quarter due to a 2 basis points decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets more than offset by a 13 basis point decrease in the average total cost of funds, which was positively impacted by a decrease in average borrowings. 
 T he average yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 2 basis points to 5.63 for the third quarter from 5.65 in the second quarter due mainly to the average yield on deposits in financial institutions decreasing by 3 basis points and the average yield on loans and leases being flat. 
 The average yield on loans and leases was unchanged at 6.18 for the third quarter compared to the second quarter as a result of new originations being at rates higher than the existing portfolio, slightly higher loan discount accretion, and the change in the mix of loan product balances including the impact of the sale of the 1.95 billion Civic loan portfolio. 
 The average total cost of funds decreased by 13 basis points to 2.82 for the third quarter from 2.95 in the second quarter due mainly to lower market interest rates and reduced average borrowings. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 13 basis points to 3.80 for the third quarter from 3.93 for the second quarter. The average total cost of deposits decreased by 6 basis points to 2.54 for the third quarter compared to 2.60 in the second quarter. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by 35.0 million for the third quarter compared to the second quarter, average total deposits decreased by 474.2 million, and average borrowings decreased by 950.1 million. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net interest income increased by 94.7 million to 690.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 596.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, offset partially by lower interest income on interest-earning assets. 
 Average interest-earning assets decreased by 5.7 billion to 33.0 billion for the first nine months of 2024 due to lower average balances in loans and leases, investments securities, and deposits in financial institutions. Average loans and leases decreased by 1.0 billion primarily due to the sale in July 2024 of 1.95 billion of Civic loans which had been moved to held for sale during the second quarter of 2024 and the sales of non-core loan portfolios in the second quarter of 2023 , offset partially by the acquisition of legacy Banc of California loans completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 . Average investment securities decreased by 2.4 billion mostly due to securities sales completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 . Average deposits in financial institutions decreased by 2.3 billion due to lower cash balances which were used to pay down higher-cost borrowings. The net interest margin increased by 72 basis points to 2.79 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.07 for the same period in 2023 due to the average yield on interest-earning assets increasing by 41 basis points, while the average total cost of funds decreased by 31 basis points. 
 The average yield on interest-earning assets increased by 41 basis points to 5.61 for the first nine months of 2024 from 5.20 for the same period in 2023 due mainly to the change in the interest-earning asset mix. This was driven by the increase in the balance of average loans and leases as a percentage of average interest-earning assets to 75 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the decrease in the balance of average investment securities as a percentage of average interest-earning assets to 14 for the first nine months of 2024 from 18 for the same period in 2023 , and the decrease in the balance of average deposits in financial institutions as a percentage of average interest-earning assets to 10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 15 for the same period in 2023 . 
 The average yield on loans and leases increased by 19 basis points to 6.14 for the first nine months of 2024 from 5.95 for the same period in 2023 as a result of changes in portfolio mix and higher net accretion of loan discounts. 

83 

The average total cost of funds decreased by 31 basis points to 2.93 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due mainly to changes in the total funds mix. This was driven by the increase in the balance of lower-cost average total deposits as a percentage of average total funds to 91 for the first nine months of 2024 from 77 for the same period in 2023 , and the decrease in the balance of higher cost average borrowings as a percentage of average total funds to 6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 21 for the same period in 2023 . The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 14 basis points to 3.89 for the first nine months of 2024 from 4.03 for the same period in 2023 . The average total cost of deposits increased by 10 basis points to 2.60 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.50 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased by 480.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and average total deposits decreased by 60.3 million . 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The following table sets forth the details of the provision for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment and held-to-maturity securities and information regarding credit quality metrics for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, June 30, September 30, 2024 2024 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Provision For Credit Losses: Addition to allowance for loan and lease losses 9,000 12,000 32,000 66,500 Reduction in reserve for unfunded loan commitments (1,000) (2,000) (61,500) Total loan-related provision 9,000 11,000 30,000 5,000 Addition to allowances for held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities Total provision for credit losses 9,000 11,000 30,000 5,000 Credit Quality Metrics: Net charge-offs on loans and leases held for investment (1)

84 

Provisions for credit losses are charged to earnings for the allowance for loan and lease losses, the reserve for unfunded loan commitments, and the allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities. The provision for credit losses on our loans and leases held for investment is based on our allowance methodology and is an expense that, in our judgment, is required to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. For further details on our loan-related allowance for credit losses methodology, see - Balance Sheet Analysis - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment contained herein. 
 Third Quarter of 2024 Compared to Second Quarter of 2024 
 The provision for credit losses was million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to million for the second quarter of 2024. The million third quarter provision was driven by increases in qualitative reserves for loans secured by office properties and concentrations of credit, and specific reserves for nonperforming loan downgrades. T he million second quarter provision was driven by higher net charge-offs and higher qualitative reserves for office loans and other concentrations of credit, offset partially by the reserves released for the Civic loans transferred to held for sale. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The provision for credit losses increased by 25.0 million to million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The higher provision in the 2024 period was generally due to higher net charge-offs and higher qualitative reserves for office loans and other concentrations of credits, offset partially by the reserves released for the Civic loans transferred to held for sale in the second quarter of 2024 and sold in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Certain circumstances may lead to increased provisions for credit losses on loans and leases in the future. Examples of such circumstances include deterioration in economic conditions and forecasts, an increased amount of classified and/or criticized loans and leases, and net loan and lease and unfunded commitment growth. Deterioration in economic conditions and forecasts include the rate of economic growth, the unemployment rate, the rate of inflation, changes in the general level of interest rates, changes in real estate values, and adverse conditions in borrowers businesses. See further discussion in - Balance Sheet Analysis - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment contained herein.

Noninterest Income 
 The following table summarizes noninterest income by category for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, June 30, September 30, Noninterest Income 2024 2024 2024 2023 (In thousands) Leased equipment income 17,176 11,487 40,379 50,798 Other commissions and fees 8,256 8,629 25,027 29,226 Service charges on deposit accounts 4,568 4,540 13,813 11,906 (Loss) gain on sale of loans and leases (62) 1,135 625 (157,820) Loss on sale of securities (59,946) (59,946) Dividends and gains on equity investments 3,730 1,166 7,964 7,593 Warrant income (loss) 211 (324) 65 (545) LOCOM HFS adjustment (74) (38) 218 (11,636) Other 10,689 3,197 20,011 22,595 Total noninterest (loss) income (15,452) 29,792 48,156 (47,883) 
 Third Quarter of 2024 Compared to Second Quarter of 2024 
 Noninterest income decreased by 45.2 million to a loss of 15.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 due mainly to a 59.9 million loss on the sale of 741.8 million of securities in the third quarter of 2024, offset partially by a 7.5 million increase in other income and a 5.7 million increase in leased equipment income. The increase in other income was due primarily to a 6.8 million increase in the positive fair value mark on the credit-linked notes. The increase in leased equipment income was due mostly to higher gains from early lease terminations and sale of leased assets. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Noninterest income increased by 96.0 million to 48.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 47.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due mostly to a decrease in the loss on sale of loans and leases of 158.4 million, offset partially by a 59.9 million loss on the sale of 741.8 million of securities in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in the loss on sale of loans and leases was due to the sales of 2.5 billion of loans for a net gain of 0.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the sales of 6.1 billion of loans for a net loss of 157.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Noninterest Expense 
 The following table summarizes noninterest expense by category for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, June 30, September 30, Noninterest Expense 2024 2024 2024 2023 (In thousands) Compensation 85,585 85,914 263,735 242,999 Customer related expense 34,475 32,405 97,799 78,278 Occupancy 16,892 17,455 52,315 45,743 Information technology and data processing 14,995 15,459 45,872 38,706 Insurance and assessments 12,708 26,431 59,600 75,650 Intangible asset amortization 8,485 8,484 Leased equipment depreciation 7,144 7,511 Other professional services 5,101 5,183 15,359 21,643 Loan expense 3,994 4,332 12,817 16,012 Other 7,340 13,119 28,485 133,958 Total operating expense 196,719 216,293 623,530 686,974 Acquisition, integration and reorganization costs (510) (12,650) (13,160) 30,833 Goodwill impairment 1,376,736 Total noninterest expense 196,209 203,643 610,370 2,094,543 
 Third Quarter of 2024 Compared to Second Quarter of 2024 
 Noninterest expense decreased by 7.4 million to 196.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 due mainly to decreases of 13.7 million in insurance and assessments expense and 5.8 million in other expense, offset partially by a lower reversal of 12.1 million in acquisition, integration and reorganization costs. The decrease in insurance and assessments expense was due to lower assessment rates for both the regular FDIC assessment and the special assessment. The decrease in other expense was mostly due to a repurchase reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2024 for standard representations and warranties associated with the Civic loan sale. Acquisition, integration and reorganization costs included an adjustment of 0.5 million for the third quarter and 12.7 million for the second quarter due to actual amounts for certain expenses being lower than the estimated amounts accrued at merger close. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Noninterest expense decreased by 1.5 billion to 610.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due mainly t o a 1.4 billion goodwill impairment recorded in the 2023 period. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Third Quarter of 2024 Compared to Second Quarter of 2024 
 Income tax expense of 2.7 million was recorded for the third quarter resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.7 compared to income tax expense of 14.3 million for the second quarter and an effective tax rate of 32.0 . The lower third quarter effective tax rate was due primarily to a true-up to the full year tax rate, an increase in disallowed executive compensation expense, and loss of tax benefits with respect to restricted stock vested during the second quarter. 

87 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Income tax expense of 28.6 million was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in an effective tax rate of 29.0 compared to an income tax benefit of 135.2 million for the same period in 2023 and an effective tax rate of 8 .7 . Excluding goodwill impairment, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 21.7 . The lower effective tax rate in 2023 was due primarily to higher FDIC insurance premiums in relation to the reported net loss for 2023.

 Due to hybrid and remote working policies adopted by most companies during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which remain in place today, there are concerns over the utilization of commercial office space which could impact the long-term performance of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate portfolio. Furthermore, higher interest rates presented a risk for the variable rate and hybrid loans in our portfolio, even considering the recent interest rate cut and expected future incremental interest rate cuts. Due to these concerns and concentrations of credit associated with commercial real estate loans, excluding owner occupied real estate loans, we have increased the qualitative reserve component of our allowance for credit losses for our office loan exposure. At September 30, 2024, mortgage loans secured by office properties represent 7.5 of total loans and leases held for investment. 
 The risks outlined above result from market conditions and are not controllable by us. However, when considering the markets in which to pursue real estate loans, we consider the market conditions, our current loan portfolio concentrations by property type and by market, and our past experiences with the borrower, within the specific market, and with the property type. 
 When underwriting real estate loans, we seek to mitigate risk by using the following framework: 
 Requiring our borrowers to invest and maintain a meaningful cash equity interest in the properties securing our loans; 
 Reviewing each loan request and renewal individually; 
 Using a credit committee approval process for the approval of loan requests (or aggregated credit exposures) over a certain dollar amount; 
 Adhering to written loan acceptance standards, including among other factors, maximum loan to acquisition cost ratios, maximum loan to as-is or stabilized value ratios, and minimum operating cash flow requirements; 
 Considering market rental and occupancy rates relative to our underwritten or projected rental and occupancy rates; 
 Considering the experience of our borrowers and our borrowers' abilities to operate and manage the properties securing our loans; 
 Evaluating the supply of comparable real estate and new supply under construction in the collateral's market area; 
 Obtaining independent third party appraisals that are reviewed by our appraisal department; and 
 Obtaining environmental risk assessments.

 The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment is the combination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for loan and lease losses is reported as a reduction of the amortized cost basis of loans and leases, while the reserve for unfunded loan commitments is included within "Accrued interest payable and other liabilities" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The amortized cost basis of loans and leases does not include accrued interest receivable, which is included in "Other assets" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The "Provision for credit losses" on the condensed consolidated statement of earnings (loss) is a combination of the provision for loan and lease losses, the provision for unfunded loan commitments, and the provision for held-to-maturity debt securities. 
 Under the CECL methodology, expected credit losses reflect losses over the remaining contractual life of an asset, considering the effect of prepayments and available information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about relevant historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and circumstances. Thus, the CECL methodology incorporates a broad range of information in developing credit loss estimates. 
 For further information regarding the calculation of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment using the CECL methodology, see Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of our Form 10-K. 
 In calculating our allowance for credit losses, we continued to consider higher inflation rates, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, the risk of a recession, technical or otherwise, and the impact of various geopolitical risks on the economy in our process for estimating expected credit losses given the changes in economic forecasts and assumptions along with the uncertainty related to the severity and duration of the economic consequences resulting from such events. Our methodology and framework along with the 4-quarter reasonable and supportable forecast period and 2-quarter reversion period have remained consistent since the implementation of CECL on January 1, 2020. Certain management assumptions are reassessed every quarter based on current expectations for credit losses, while other assumptions are assessed and updated on at least an annual basis. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, we used the Moody s September 30, 2024 Baseline and S2 Downside 75th Percentile for the calculation of our quantitative component. The weightings of the scenarios were based on management s current expectations for the economic forecast, acknowledging the risk of recession over our reasonable and supportable forecast period and inherent uncertainty in the economy. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, updates to the economic forecasts, including the Company's scenario weighting, resulted in an immaterial impact to the allowance for credit losses. 
 The primary drivers behind higher quantitative reserves compared to the prior quarter were an increase of specific reserves associated with nonperforming loans and higher reserves due to risk rating migration. The increase in quantitative reserves was partially offset by changes in portfolio mix along with charge-off activity. The Company has successfully grown portfolios with lower risk of loss during the quarter, such as warehouse lending and lender finance, while portfolios requiring higher reserves, such as commercial real estate, have lower overall balances. 
 As part of our allowance for credit losses methodology, we consistently incorporate the use of qualitative factors in determining the overall allowance for credit losses to capture risks that may not be adequately reflected in our quantitative models. Such qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to: economic conditions not captured in in the quantitative reserve; collateral dependency related to certain loan portfolios including loans secured by office properties that were directly impacted by flexible/hybrid work environment; concentrations of credit within the loan portfolio including the commercial real estate portfolio; the quality of the Company s credit review system; the volume and severity of adversely classified financial assets; the Company s lending policies and procedures; and the effect of other external factors such as the regulatory and legal environments. During the third quarter of 2024, reserves associated with the qualitative adjustments increased when compared to the prior quarter. Primary qualitative adjustments are related to loans secured by office properties and concentration of credit associated with commercial real estate loans, multi-family loans, and construction loans.

The use of different economic forecasts, whether based on different scenarios, the use of multiple or single scenarios, or updated economic forecasts and scenarios, can change the outcome of the calculations. In addition to the economic forecasts, there are numerous components and assumptions that are integral to the overall estimation of allowance for credit losses. As part of our allowance for credit losses process, sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the impact of how changing certain assumptions could impact the estimated allowance for credit losses. At times, these analyses can provide information to further assist management in making decisions related to certain assumptions. We calculated alternative values for our ACL using various alternative forecast scenarios weightings and the calculated amounts for the quantitative component differed from the probability-weighted multiple scenario forecast ranging from decreases in the dollar amount of the quantitative component of the ACL by 2.03 to 6.65 . However, changing one assumption and not reassessing other assumptions used in the quantitative or qualitative process could yield results that are not reasonable or appropriate, hence all assumptions and information must be considered. From a sensitivity analysis perspective, changing key assumptions such as the macro-economic variable inputs from the economic forecasts, the reasonable and supportable forecast period, prepayment rates, loan segmentation, historical loss factors and/or periods, among others, would all change the outcome of the quantitative components of the allowance for credit losses. Those results would then need to be assessed from a qualitative perspective potentially requiring further adjustments to the qualitative component to arrive at a reasonable and appropriate allowance for credit losses. 
 The determination of the allowance for credit losses is complex and highly dependent on numerous models, assumptions, and judgments made by management. Management's current expectation for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment as quantified in the allowance for credit losses considers the impact of assumptions and is reflective of historical credit experience, economic forecasts viewed to be reasonable and supportable, current loan and lease composition, and relative credit risks known as of the balance sheet date. 
 Management believes the allowance for credit losses is appropriate for the current expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio and associated unfunded loan commitments, and the credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are reasonable and appropriate as of the reporting date. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different conclusions that could result in a significant impact to the Company's financial statements.

Credit Quality 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we continued to remain conservative on risk rating of loans and leases. Increases to classified loans and leases that remained on accrual status resulted from downward migration for groups of loans and leases where performance deteriorated or increased borrower financial information was determined to be necessary. Nonaccrual loans and leases increased in the quarter primarily due to two commercial loans and one legacy Civic loan that migrated to nonperforming status.

Regulatory Matters 
 
 Capital 
 Bank regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy through standardized risk-based capital guidelines that compare different levels of capital (as defined by such guidelines) to risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet obligations. At September 30, 2024, banks considered to be well capitalized must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.00 , a minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.50 , a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.00 , and a minimum Total risk-based capital ratio of 10.00 . 
 Regulatory capital requirements limit the amount of deferred tax assets that may be included when determining the amount of regulatory capital. Deferred tax asset amounts in excess of the calculated limit are disallowed from regulatory capital. At September 30, 2024, such disallowed amounts was 284.7 million for the Company. No assurance can be given that the regulatory capital deferred tax asset limitation will not increase in the future or that the Company will not have increased deferred tax assets that are disallowed. 
 Basel III currently requires all banking organizations to maintain a 2.50 capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is exclusively comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not to the leverage ratio. Effective January 1, 2019, the common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratio minimums inclusive of the capital conservation buffer were 7.00 , 8.50 , and 10.50 . At September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank were in compliance with the capital conservation buffer requirements. 
 The Company and the Bank elected the CECL 5-year regulatory transition guidance for calculating regulatory capital ratios and the September 30, 2024 ratios include this election. This regulatory guidance allows an entity to add back to capital 100 of the capital impact from the day one CECL transition adjustment and 25 of subsequent increases to the allowance for credit losses through December 31, 2021. This cumulative amount is now being phased out of regulatory capital evenly over the three years from 2022 to 2024. The add-back as of September 30, 2024 ranged from 0 basis points to 3 basis points for the capital ratios below. 
 The following tables present a comparison of our actual capital ratios to the minimum required ratios and well capitalized ratios as of the dates indicated: 
 Minimum Required For Capital For Capital For Well September 30, December 31, Adequacy Conservation Capitalized 2024 2023 Purposes Buffer Classification Banc of California, Inc.: Tier 1 leverage capital ratio 9.83 9.00 4.00 N/A N/A CET1 capital ratio 10.46 10.14 4.50 7.00 N/A Tier 1 capital ratio 12.88 12.44 6.00 8.50 N/A Total capital ratio 17.00 16.43 8.00 10.50 N/A Banc of California: Tier 1 leverage capital ratio 10.74 9.62 4.00 N/A 5.00 CET1 capital ratio 14.08 13.27 4.50 7.00 6.50 Tier 1 capital ratio 14.08 13.27 6.00 8.50 8.00 Total capital ratio 16.61 15.75 8.00 10.50 10.00 
 The Company's consolidated risk-based capital ratios increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due mainly to a decrease in risk-weighted assets and positive earnings for the period. The consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due mainly to a decrease in average assets attributable primarily to decreased cash and cash equivalents. 

103 

Subordinated Debt 
 We issued or assumed through mergers subordinated debt to trusts that were established by us or entities we acquired, which, in turn, issued trust preferred securities. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of subordinated debt totaled 942.2 million. At September 30, 2024, 131.0 million of the trust preferred securities were included in the Company's Tier I capital and 796.2 million were included in Tier II capital. 
 
 Dividends on Common Stock and Interest on Subordinated Debt 
 As a bank holding company, Banc of California, Inc. is required to notify and receive approval from the FRB prior to declaring and paying a dividend to common stockholders during any period in which quarterly and/or cumulative twelve-month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements. Interest payments made on subordinated debt are considered dividend payments under FRB regulations. We may not pay a dividend if the FRB objects or until such time as we receive approval from the FRB or we no longer need to provide notice under applicable regulations. The Company currently is required to receive FRB approval to declare or pay a dividend to stockholders. Further, if the Company defaults or elects to defer the interest payments on its subordinated debt, it is restricted from paying dividends on its Series F preferred and common stock. 
 
 Dividends on Preferred Stock 
 The Company's ability to pay dividends on the Series F preferred stock depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the holding company. The ability of the Company and the Bank to pay dividends in the future is subject to bank regulatory requirements, including capital regulations and policies established by the FRB, and the DFPI, as applicable. Dividends on the Series F preferred stock will not be declared, paid, or set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable FRB capital adequacy regulations and policies. 
 Dividends on the Series F preferred stock are not cumulative or mandatory. If the Company's Board of Directors does not declare a dividend on the Series F preferred stock in respect of a dividend period, then no dividend shall be deemed to be payable for such dividend period or be cumulative, and the Company will have no obligation to pay any dividend for that dividend period, whether or not the Board of Directors declares a dividend on the Series F preferred stock or any other class or series of its capital stock for any future dividend period. However, if dividends on the Series F preferred stock have not been declared or paid for the equivalent of six dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, holders of the outstanding shares of Series F preferred stock, together with holders of any other series of the Company's preferred stock ranking equal with the Series F preferred stock with similar voting rights, will generally be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors. Additionally, so long as any share of Series F preferred stock remains outstanding, unless dividends on all outstanding shares of Series F preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend period have been paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment, no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on the Company's common stock. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity Management 
 Liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Company s business operations or unanticipated events. 
 We have a Management Finance Committee ("MFC") that is comprised of members of senior management and is responsible for managing commitments to meet the needs of customers while achieving our financial objectives. MFC meets regularly to review funding capacities, current and forecasted loan demand, and investment opportunities. 
 We manage our liquidity by maintaining pools of liquid assets on-balance sheet, consisting of cash and receivables due from banks, interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions, and unpledged available-for-sale securities, which we refer to as our primary liquidity. We also maintain available borrowing capacity under secured credit lines with the FHLB and the FRBSF, which we refer to as our secondary liquidity. 

104 

As a member of the FHLB, the Bank had secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB of 6.6 billion at September 30, 2024, and 471.6 million pledged for letters of credit and a balance outstanding of 1.1 billion as of that date. The FHLB secured credit line was collateralized by a blanket lien on 10.5 billion of certain qualifying loans and 20.9 million of securities. The Bank also had secured borrowing capacity with the FRBSF under the Discount Window program totaling 6.9 billion at September 30, 2024, of which 6.7 billion was available. The FRBSF Discount Window secured credit line was collateralized by liens on 6.7 billion of qualifying loans and 1.8 billion of pledged securities. 
 In addition to its secured lines of credit with the FHLB and FRBSF, the Bank also maintains unsecured lines of credit for the purpose of borrowing overnight funds, subject to availability, of 290.0 million in the aggregate with several correspondent banks. As of September 30, 2024, there was no balance outstanding related to these unsecured lines of credit. The Bank is a member of the AFX, through which it may either borrow or lend funds on an overnight or short-term basis with a group of pre-approved commercial banks. The availability of funds changes daily. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance through the AFX. 
 The following tables provide a summary of the Bank s primary and secondary liquidity levels at the dates indicated: 
 September 30, December 31, 
 Primary Liquidity - On-Balance Sheet 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Cash and due from banks 251,869 202,427 Interest-earning deposits in financial institutions 2,302,358 5,175,149 Less: restricted cash (183,247) (185,147) Securities available-for-sale, at fair value 2,300,284 2,346,864 Less: pledged securities, available-for-sale, at fair value (4,313) (2,063,754) Total primary liquidity 4,666,951 5,475,539 Ratio of primary liquidity to total assets 14.0 14.2 
 
 Secondary Liquidity - Off-Balance Sheet September 30, December 31, 
 Available Secured Borrowing Capacity 2024 2023 (In thousands) Total secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB 6,552,711 5,302,210 Less: letters of credit (471,580) (243,801) Less: secured advances outstanding (1,100,000) Available secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB 4,981,131 5,058,409 Total secured borrowing capacity with the FRBSF 6,942,509 6,916,235 Less: secured advances outstanding (200,000) Available secured borrowing capacity with the FRBSF 6,742,509 6,916,235 Total secondary liquidity 11,723,640 11,974,644 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's primary liquidity decreased by 808.6 million to 4.7 billion at September 30, 2024 due mainly to a 2.9 billion decrease in interest-earning deposits in financial institutions, offset partially by a decrease of 2.1 billion in pledged AFS securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's secondary liquidity decreased by 251.0 million to 11.7 billion at September 30, 2024 due to decreases in available secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB of 77.3 million and available secured borrowing capacity with the FRB of 173.7 million. 

105 

Obtaining new customer deposits, or having existing customers increase their deposit balances with us, are the primary sources of funding for our operations and is one the highest priorities of the Company. See "- Balance Sheet Analysis - Deposits" for additional information and detail of our deposits. Additionally, we fund our operations with cash flows from our loan and securities portfolios. 
 Our deposit balances may decrease if customers withdraw funds from the Bank. In order to address the Bank s liquidity risk from fluctuating deposit balances, the Bank maintains adequate levels of available liquidity on and off the balance sheet. 
 We use brokered deposits, the availability of which is uncertain and subject to competitive market forces and regulation, for liquidity management purposes. At September 30, 2024, brokered deposits totaled 2.6 billion, consisting of 638.8 million of non-maturity brokered accounts and 2.0 billion of brokered time deposits. At December 31, 2023, brokered deposits totaled 4.6 billion, consisting of 1.1 billion of non-maturity brokered accounts and 3.5 billion of brokered time deposits. 
 Our liquidity policy includes guidelines, which are governed by the Company's Risk Appetite Statement, which include the following metrics: Primary Liquidity Ratio (unencumbered liquid assets and the market value of unpledged AFS securities, net of a haircut, divided by total assets), Brokered Deposits to Total Funding Ratio (wholesale deposits to total deposits plus borrowings), Total Borrowings to Total Funding Ratio (borrowings to total deposits and borrowings), Short-Term Non-Core Funding Ratio (retail time deposits of 250,000 or more that mature within one year, brokered deposits that mature within one year, listing service deposits that mature within one year, official checks, escrow and title company deposits, 1031 exchange accommodator deposits, Federal Funds purchased, and borrowings that mature within one year as a percentage of total assets) and the Wholesale Funding Ratio (wholesale deposits and borrowings to total assets). At September 30, 2024, the Bank was in compliance with all of its funding concentration liquidity guidelines. 
 
 Holding Company Liquidity 
 Banc of California, Inc. acts as a source of financial strength for the Bank which can also include being a source of liquidity. The primary sources of liquidity for the holding company include dividends from the Bank, intercompany tax payments from the Bank, and Banc of California, Inc.'s ability to raise capital, issue subordinated debt, and secure outside borrowings. Banc of California, Inc.'s ability to obtain funds for the payment of dividends to our stockholders, the repurchase of shares of common stock, and other cash requirements is largely dependent upon the Bank s earnings. The Bank is subject to restrictions under certain federal and state laws and regulations that limit its ability to transfer funds to the holding company through intercompany loans, advances, or cash dividends. Banc of California, Inc.'s ability to pay dividends is also subject to the restrictions set forth by the FRB, and by certain covenants contained in our subordinated debt. See "-Regulatory Matters - Dividend on Preferred Stock " for information regarding the payment of dividends on the Series F preferred stock. 
 At September 30, 2024, Banc of California, Inc. had 192.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which a substantial amount was on deposit at the Bank. We believe this amount of cash, along with anticipated future dividends from the Bank, will be sufficient to fund the holding company s cash flow needs over the next 12 months. 
 Our obligations also include off-balance sheet arrangements consisting of loan commitments, of which only a portion is expected to be funded, and standby letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, our loan commitments and standby letters of credit were 5.0 billion and 201.3 million. The loan commitments, a portion of which will eventually result in funded loans, increase our profitability through net interest income when drawn and unused commitment fees prior to being drawn. We manage our overall liquidity taking into consideration funded and unfunded commitments as a percentage of our liquidity sources. Our liquidity sources, as described in "- Liquidity - Liquidity Management ," have been and are expected to be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of our lending activities. For further information on loan commitments, see Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies , of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 This analysis should be read in conjunction with text under the caption " Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk " in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which text is incorporated herein by reference. Our analysis of market risk and market-sensitive financial information contains forward-looking statements and is subject to the disclosure at the beginning of Item 2 regarding such forward-looking information. 
 
 Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exposure 
 We enter into foreign exchange contracts with our clients and counterparty banks primarily for the purpose of offsetting or hedging clients' foreign currency exposures arising out of commercial transactions, and we enter into cross currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge exposures to loans and debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net earnings as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar and the derivatives that hedge those exposures. As of September 30, 2024, the U.S. Dollar notional amounts of loans receivable and subordinated debt payable denominated in foreign currencies were 8.1 million and 28.7 million, and the U.S. Dollar notional amounts of derivatives outstanding to hedge these foreign currency exposures were 8.1 million and 28.5 million. We recognized a foreign currency translation net loss of 752,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a foreign currency translation net loss of 97,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 Interest Rate Risk - Company Governance. On a monthly basis, we measure our IRR position using two methods: (i) Net Interest Income ("NII") simulation analysis and (ii) Economic Value of Equity ("EVE") modeling. The Management Finance Committee ("MFC") and the Finance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors review the results of these analyses at least quarterly. As discussed in more detail below, if projected changes to interest rates cause changes to our simulated net present value of equity and/or net interest income to be outside our pre-established IRR limits, we may adjust our asset and liability mix in an effort to bring our interest rate risk exposure within our established limits. 
 The pre-established IRR Limits are recommended by management, determined based on analytical review and available peer data published by regulatory agencies about the IRR Limits utilized by other regional banks, and documented in the Company's ALCO Policy. The ALCO Policy is approved by MFC and the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors annually. We believe our ALCO Policy IRR Limits are consistent with prevailing practice in the regional banking industry. 
 We use a balance sheet simulation model (the "IRR Model") to estimate changes in NII and EVE that would result from immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as of the measurement date. This IRR Model assesses the changes in NII and EVE that would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase and decrease in market interest rates of +-100, +-200, +-300, and +400 basis points. This model is an IRR management tool, and the results are not necessarily an indication of our future net interest income. The IRR Model has inherent limitations and the model's results are based on a given set of rate changes and assumptions at a single point in time. 
 The IRR Model is updated monthly and the IRR Model results are reported to MFC and the Finance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors at each monthly or quarterly meeting, as applicable. 
 Our Risk When Interest Rates Change. The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Accordingly, our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk. 
 How We Measure Our Risk of Interest Rate Changes. As part of our attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations, we have established asset/liability committees to monitor our interest rate risk. In monitoring interest rate risk we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and/or prepayments, and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates. 

107 

The Management Finance Committee ("MFC") is comprised of select members of senior management. The Company also has a Finance Committee of the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank (together with MFC, the ALCOs ). In order to manage the risk of potential adverse effects of material and prolonged or volatile changes in interest rates on our results of operations, we have adopted asset/liability management policies to align maturities and repricing terms of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities. The asset/liability management policies establish guidelines for the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs, while management monitors adherence to those guidelines with oversight by the ALCOs. The objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity, capital adequacy, growth, risk, and profitability goals. The ALCOs meet no less than quarterly to review, among other things, economic conditions and interest rate outlook, current and projected liquidity needs and capital position, anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate risk exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to our economic value of equity analysis. 
 In order to manage our assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity, credit quality, interest rate risk, profitability, and capital targets, we evaluate various strategies including: 
 Complementing our current loan origination platform through strategic acquisitions of whole loans, 
 Strategically managing multiple warehouse relationships, 
 Originating shorter-term consumer loans, 
 Managing the level of investments and duration of investment securities, 
 Managing our deposits to establish stable deposit relationships, and 
 Using FHLB advances and/or certain derivatives such as swaps as hedges to align maturities and repricing terms. 
 At times, depending on the level of general interest rates, the relationship between long- and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, the ALCOs may decide to increase our interest rate risk position within the asset/liability tolerance set forth by our Board of Directors. As part of its procedures, the ALCOs regularly review interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and our economic value of equity. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity and Net Interest Income 
 Interest rate risk results from our banking activities and is the primary market risk for us. Interest rate risk is caused by the following factors: 
 Repricing risk - timing differences in the repricing and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; 
 Option risk - changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities, such as borrowers ability to prepay loans and depositors ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity; 
 Yield curve risk - changes in the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion; and 
 Basis risk - changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S. Prime Rate, and SOFR. 
 Since our earnings are primarily dependent on our ability to generate net interest income, we focus on actively monitoring and managing the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on our net interest income. Management of our interest rate risk is overseen by the Finance Committee of the Boards of Directors of the Company and Bank, which delegates the day to day management of interest rate risk to the MFC. MFC ensures that the Bank is following the appropriate and current regulatory guidance in the formulation and implementation of our interest rate risk program. The Finance Committee of the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank reviews the results of our interest rate risk modeling quarterly to ensure that we have appropriately measured our interest rate risk, mitigated our exposures appropriately and any residual risk is acceptable. In addition to our annual review of our asset liability management policy, our Board of Directors periodically reviews the interest rate risk policy limits. 
 Interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and policy constraints. 

108 

Our interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, including a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analysis under multiple scenarios. The simulation model is based on the actual maturities and re-pricing characteristics of the Bank s interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The simulated interest rate scenarios include an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve Rate Shock ). We then evaluate the simulation results using two approaches: Net Interest Income at Risk NII at Risk ), and Economic Value of Equity EVE ). Under NII at Risk, the impact on net interest income from changes in interest rates on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets, liabilities, and derivatives. 
 We used a NII simulation model to measure the estimated changes in NII that would result over the next twelve months from immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as of September 30, 2024. We have assumed no growth or changes in the product mix of either our total interest-sensitive assets or liabilities over the next twelve months, therefore the results reflect an interest rate shock to a static balance sheet. This model is an interest rate risk management tool and the results are not necessarily an indication of our future net interest income. 
 EVE measures the period end present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities. Asset liability management uses this value to measure the changes in the economic value of the Company under various interest rate scenarios. In some ways, the economic value approach provides a broader scope than net income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows. 
 The balance sheet is considered asset sensitive when an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to expand our net interest income, as rates earned on our interest-earning assets reprice higher at a pace faster than rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Conversely, the balance sheet is considered liability sensitive when an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to compress our net interest income, as rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities reprice higher at a pace faster than rates earned on our interest-earning assets. 
 At September 30, 2024, our interest rate risk profile is liability sensitive, but less liability sensitive as compared to our interest rate risk profile position as of December 31, 2023. This shift is primarily due to the change in the mix of funding sources during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from the paydowns of the Bank Term Funding Program balances. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing, and direction of future interest rate movements, as well as the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary materially from those predicted by our model. 
 The following table presents the projected change in the Company s economic value of equity at September 30, 2024 and net interest income over the next twelve months, that would occur upon an immediate change in interest rates, but without giving effect to any steps that management might take to counteract that change:

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 and have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The information set forth in Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.
