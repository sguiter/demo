All share amounts have been retroactively restated to give effect to these changes. 

On
August 9, 2023, the Company consummated an initial public offering IPO ), conducted on a firm commitment basis, pursuant to which it sold 
shares of its common stock at a price of

for the offering and Spartan Capital Securities, LLC acted as co-manager for the offering. The underwriters did not exercise their

of 
(such 
in commissions and fees amounted to a total of at closing, as well as 
for the reimbursement of certain of the underwriters expenses. Additionally, as partial consideration for services rendered
in connection with the offering, the Company issued Alexander unregistered warrants to purchase an aggregate of 
shares of Company common stock, representing 
of the aggregate shares sold in the offering. The warrants have an initial exercise price of 
per share (equal to

On
August 15, 2024, the Company s shareholders (i) authorized 
shares of preferred stock of which 
shares were designated as 
par value Series B Preferred Stock with 
shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024, (ii)
retired shares of Series A Preferred Stock and (iii) retired shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock. 

The
Company is headquartered in Carmel, Indiana. The Company specializes in the development, production, and sale of medical neuromodulation
devices. 

The
Company has developed three FDA cleared products, the IB-STIM (DEN180057, 2019), the NSS-2 Bridge (DEN170018, 2017), and the original
510(K) clearance (K140530, 2014). 

The
 IB-STIM is a percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulator (PENFS) device that is indicated in patients 11-18 years of age with
 functional abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome. The IB-STIM currently is the only product marketed and sold by
 the Company. 

The
 NSS-2 Bridge is a percutaneous nerve field stimulator (PNFS) device indicated for use in the reduction of the symptoms of opioid
 withdrawal. The NSS-2 Bridge device was licensed to Masimo Corporation in April 2020, and the Company received a one-time licensing
 fee of from Masimo. Masimo markets and sells this product as its Masimo Bridge, and the Company will not receive any further
 licensing payments or other revenue from this product. 

The
 original 510(K) device was the EAD, an electroacupuncture device, now called NeuroStim. The EAD is no longer being manufactured,
 sold or distributed but reserved only for research purposes. 

The
Company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America U.S. GAAP and following the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by
U.S. GAAP can be condensed or omitted. These interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the Company s
annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments which are necessary for a fair presentation of
the Company s financial information. These unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the year ending December 31, 2024, or any other interim period or for any other future year. These unaudited financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December
31, 2023. 

The
Company s Level 3 accounts include warrant liabilities. Inputs to determine fair value are generally unobservable
and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.
The valuation techniques involve management s estimates and judgment based on unobservable inputs. The fair value estimates may
not be indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a market exchange. Additionally, there may be inherent uncertainties or changes
in the underlying assumptions used, which could significantly affect the current or future fair value estimates. Unobservable inputs
used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. 

There
were no transfers between any of the levels during the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In addition to assets
and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company s assets and liabilities are also subject to
nonrecurring fair value measurements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had assets that were measured on
a nonrecurring basis.

In
accordance with FASB s ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ASC 606 ), the Company recognizes revenue
when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines
are within the scope of ASC 606, it performs the following five steps: 

(i) 
 identify
 the contract(s) with a customer 

(ii) 
 identify
 the performance obligations in the contract 

(iii) 
 determine
 the transaction price 

(iv) 
 allocate
 the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 

(v) 
 recognize
 revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

The
Company applies the five-step model to contracts when it determines that it is probable it will collect substantially all the consideration
it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined
to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that
are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the
amount of the transaction price, after consideration of variability and constraints, if any, that is allocated to the respective performance
obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied. 

The
Company estimates credit losses on accounts receivable by estimating expected credit losses over the contractual term of the receivable
using a discounted cash flow method. When developing this estimate of expected credit losses, the Company considers all available information
(past, current, and future) relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows. 

The
Company offers a Patient Assistance Program for patients without insurance coverage for IB-Stim. This program extends potential self-pay
discounts for IB-Stim devices, based upon household income and size. 

Also,
the Company offers providers an opt-in program to address adequate insurance claim payments on IB-Stim devices. This program may extend
a rebate or invoice credit where the insurance payment and patient responsibility (i.e., deductible, co-payment, and/or co-insurance
amounts required by the Payer) are less than the acquisition cost of the IB-Stim device. The Company recognizes revenue at such a time
that collection of the amount due is assured. 

The
following economic factors affect the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of the Company s revenue and cash flows as indicated: 

Type
of customer: Based on dollar amounts of revenue, essentially all of the goods sold by the Company are sold to healthcare customers
including hospitals and clinics. Sales to healthcare customers lack seasonality and have a mild correlation with economic cycles. 

Geographical
location of customers: Sales to customers located within the United States represent essentially all of the Company s sales. 

Type
of contract: Sales contracts consist of purchase order contracts that tend to be short-term (i.e., less than or equal to one year
in duration). 

Company s
Performance Obligations with Customers: 

Timing
of Satisfaction 

The
Company typically satisfies its performance obligations as the goods are received at the customer s destination. 

Goods
that are shipped to customers are typically shipped FOB destination with freight prepaid by the Company. As such, ownership of goods
in transit transfer to the customer when received and the Company bears the associated risks (e.g., loss, damage, delay). 

Shipping
and handling costs are recorded as cost of goods sold in the Statement of Operations. 

Significant
Payment Terms 

Payment
for goods sold by the Company is typically due after an invoice is sent to the customer, within 30 days. Invoices for goods are typically
sent to customers within three calendar days of shipment. The Company does not offer discounts if the customer pays some or all of an
invoiced amount prior to the due date. 

None
of the Company s contracts have a significant financing component. 

Nature 

Medical
devices that the Company contracts to sell and transfer to customers are manufactured by one specific third-party manufacturer. The manufacturer
is located within the state of Indiana. In no case does the Company act as an agent (i.e., the Company does not provide a service of
arranging for another party to transfer goods to the customer). 

Returns,
Refunds, etc. 

Orders
may not be cancelled after shipment. Customers may return devices within 10 days of delivery if the goods are found to be defective,
nonconforming, or otherwise do not meet the stated technical specifications. At the option of the customer, the Company shall either: 

Refund
 the price paid for any defective or nonconforming products. 

Supply
 and deliver to the customer replacement conforming products. 

Reimburse
 the customer for the cost of repairing any defective or nonconforming products. 

At
the time revenue is recognized, the Company estimates expected returns and excludes those amounts from revenue. The Company also maintains
appropriate accounts to reflect the effects of expected returns on the Company s financial position and periodically adjusts those
accounts to reflect its actual return experience. 

and short-term outstanding borrowings of .
As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of and
a working capital deficit of . 

Our
future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing, and marketing our technologies,
the time and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights,
our ability to establish collaborative arrangements, marketing activities and competing technological and market developments, including
regulatory changes and overall economic conditions in our target markets. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability requires
us to successfully market and secure purchase orders for our products from customers currently identified in our sales pipeline and to
new customers as well. The primary activity that will drive all customers and revenues is the adoption of insurance coverage by commercial
insurance carriers nationally, which is a top priority of the Company. These activities, including our planned research and development
efforts, will require significant uses of working capital through the rest of 2024 and beyond. 

Management
evaluates whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of one year from the date the financial statements are issued. 

To
date, the Company has experienced operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. Management believes that increased sales
and acceptance of their product by insurance providers will allow the Company to achieve profitability in the near term. 

While
the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues and in
its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering of its debt or equity securities, there can be no assurance
that it will be able to do so on reasonable terms, or at all. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues and its ability to raise additional funds by
way of a public or private offering. Neither future cash generated from operating activities, nor management s contingency plans
to mitigate the risk and extend cash resources through the evaluation period, are considered probable. As a result, substantial doubt
is deemed to exist about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. As we continue to incur losses, our transition to
profitability is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support its cost structure. We may never achieve profitability,
and unless and until doing so, we intend to fund future operations through additional dilutive or nondilutive financing. There can be
no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the
amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Operating
lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over
the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received.
The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental
borrowing rate to discount lease payments, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis
the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. Prospectively, the Company
will adjust the right-of-use assets for straight-line rent expense, or any incentives received and remeasure the lease liability at the
net present value using the same incremental borrowing rate that was in effect as of the lease commencement or transition date. The Company
has elected not to recognize leases with an original term of one year or less on the balance sheet. The Company typically only includes
an initial lease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company s assessment
unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew. Certain leases may contain rent escalation clauses, either fixed or adjusted periodically for inflation
of market rates, that are factored into the calculation of lease payments to the extent they are fixed and determinable at lease inception.
The Company also has variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, primarily for items such as common area maintenance
and real estate taxes, which are recorded as expenses when incurred. 

Assumptions
made by the Company at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events, including a lease modification. A lease
modification results in a separate contract when the modification grants the lessee an additional right of use not included in the original
lease and when lease payments increase commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use. When a lease modification
results in a separate contract, it is accounted for in the same manner as a new lease. 

Entities
may elect not to separate lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components together
as a single lease component for all underlying assets and allocate all the contract consideration to the lease component only. 

The
Company s leases are comprised of operating leases for office space. At the inception of the lease, the Company determines whether
the lease contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Leases
are classified as operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease. Operating leases are recorded as operating lease
right-of-use assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in the Balance Sheets. The Company did not have any finance
leases as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The
Company has two leases primarily consisting of office space in Versailles and Carmel, Indiana. with a per annum increase. The new lease in Carmel started January 1, 2024. The initial term is five
years and five months. The monthly lease payment started at with an annual increase of . As long as the Company is not in
default, it is only obligated to pay an amount equal to 50 of the monthly base rent for months 1-10.

conspiracy and seeks compensatory damages in excess of , pre-judgment interest, punitive damages, attorney s fees, and court
costs. The Complaint states that the Company, distributors of the Company s product, and medical billing and coding consultants
allegedly made misrepresentations to the plaintiffs that the Company s NeuroStim device and related procedures could be billed
to, and reimbursed by, Medicare and other insurance payors as a surgically implantable neurostimulator. Plaintiffs claim to have suffered
damages when Medicare administrative contractors declined to pay plaintiffs for their use of the device. 

On
September 28, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss all claims. On May 25, 2023, the Court issued an Order and a Memorandum Opinion
which dismissed the plaintiff s claims related to the RICO Act. The remaining claims are still pending, and no trial date has been
set for the case. 

The
Court has vacated its Scheduling Order at the parties request so that the parties could try to resolve the disputes in both cases
through an independent third-party mediator. No mediation date has been set. While it is too early to predict the ultimate outcome of
this matter, we believe the Company has meritorious defenses and intends to defend this matter vigorously.

On
October 15, 2024, the Company received 
in exchange for

On
November 9, 2024, the Company entered into a investment agreement with a reputable life sciences fund at terms identical to
the Series B Preferred Stock Shareholders, including the extension of the expiration date of the cumulative dividends from June 30, 2025
to December 31, 2026, that replaced a reduction in committed funding from an existing investor. The transaction is expected
to close mid-November.

ITEM
2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited financial
statements and the related notes appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion
and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy
for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. You should
read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report for a discussion of important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements
contained in the following discussion and analysis. 

Overview 

We
are a growth stage company focused on developing neuromodulation therapies to address chronic and debilitating conditions in children.
Our mission is to provide solutions that create value and provide better and safer patient outcomes. Our IB-Stim device is a PENFS system
intended to be used in patients 11-18 years of age with functional abdominal pain associated with IBS. Our device already has market
clearance from FDA for functional abdominal pain associated with IBS in children. Other indications in our pipeline are comprised of
functional nausea in children, post-concussion syndrome in children, and cyclic vomiting syndrome in children. For more information,
see Business Our Pipeline and Products . 

Since
our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was 1,755,234 and 8,625,363 for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 6,793,596 and 13,034,385 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 1,793,932. Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern in their audit opinion. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable
future as we continue to pursue widespread insurance coverage of our IB-Stim device and seek FDA clearance of our device for other indications.
There are a number of milestones and conditions that we must satisfy before we will be able to generate sufficient revenue to fund our
operations, including FDA clearance of our IB-Stim device to treat future indications. 

Factors
Affecting our Business and Results of Operations 

Revenue 

Our
revenue is derived from the sale of our IB-Stim device to healthcare companies, primarily hospitals and clinics. Sales generally are
not seasonal and only mildly correlated with economic cycles. Our IB-Stim device sells for 1,195 per device, and each child being treated
for functional abdominal pain associated with IBS will use three to four devices. Potential patients with future indications are expected
to use six or more devices per patient. 

Our
sales typically are made on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term purchase commitments. We enter into sales agreements
with customers for IB-Stim devices based on purchase orders and standard terms, which vary slightly based on the customer s form,
and conditions of sale. Standard payment terms generally are that payment is due within 30 days. 

27 

Inflation
did not have a material impact on our operations for any applicable period, and we do not expect inflation to have a material impact
on our operations for the foreseeable future. 

Gross
Profit and Gross Margin 

Our
management uses gross profit and gross margin to evaluate the efficiency of operations and as a key component to determining the
effectiveness and allocation of resources. We calculate gross profit as net sales less cost of goods sold, and gross margin as gross
profit divided by net sales. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily the
average selling price of our IB-Stim device, production volume, order flows, change in mix of customers, third-party manufacturing
costs related to components of our IB-Stim device, and cost-reduction strategies. We expect our gross profit to increase for the
foreseeable future as our net sales grows, both through broader insurer acceptance of our IB-Stim device in the near term and
approval of our technology for the treatment of other indications over the longer term. Our gross margin may fluctuate from quarter
to quarter due to changes in average selling prices, particularly as we introduce enhancements to our IB-Stim device and new
products to address other indications, and as we adopt new manufacturing processes and technologies. 

Expenses 

We
have four categories of expenses: cost of goods sold, selling, research and development, and general and administrative. 

Costs
of goods sold consist of costs paid for the IB-Stim device to our contract manufacturer along with shipping
and handling costs and
expired inventory charges. Expired inventory expense is related to our FDA clearance for our device in the treatment of functional
abdominal pain associated with IBS in children. Specifically, a certain component of our IB-Stim device is cleared for a two-year period
after the date the device is manufactured, and if the device is not sold in such period, we must take the device out of inventory and
write it off. We had no expired inventory for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Expired inventory has not
been material to our results. We have a fixed-price contract with the manufacturer of our IB-Stim device to produce the device. We expect
production costs to remain relatively constant and only nominal inventory expirations in the foreseeable future. 

Our
core selling expenses primarily consist of commissions. 

Research
and development expense is attributable to our clinical trials and related efforts to have our IB-Stim device cleared by the FDA for
other indications. We expect to incur future R D expenses for other indications, such as functional nausea, post-concussion syndrome
and cyclic vomiting syndrome in children. 

General
and administrative expense primarily consists of wages and benefits, professional fees including legal and audit, insurance, investor
relations, advertising, facility costs, utilities and travel.

Net
Sales 

Net
sales increased 189,165, or 39.6 , from 477,460 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 666,625 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024. Net sales decreased 3,830, or 0.2 , from 1,928,590 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,924,760
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to volume
growth from new and existing full insurance reimbursement customers as well as growth in our financial assistance programs that provide
discounts to patients without insurance coverage. 

Gross
Profit and Gross Margin 

Gross
profit increased 159,402, or 38.9 , from 410,173 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 569,575 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 due to higher sales volume. Despite the increase in sales volume, the decrease in gross margin from 85.9 
for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 85.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to higher growth in the
Company s financial assistance programs that are discounted to patients without insurance coverage compared to the
Company s undiscounted full reimbursement customers. Gross profit decreased 29,779, or 1.8 , from 1,697,590 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,667,811 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to gross margin. The decrease in
gross margin from 88.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 86.7 for the nine months ended September, 2024 was due to
growth in our financial assistance programs that are discounted to patients without insurance coverage despite higher sales
volume. 

Selling
Expenses 

Selling
expenses increased 31,220, or 48.6 , from 64,210 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 95,430 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 due to higher sales volume. Selling expenses decreased 24,559, or 9.8 , from 250,933 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, to 226,374 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower sales volume. 

Research
and Development 

Research
and development expenses increased 27,472, or 61.1 , from 44,950 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 72,422 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher quarter-to-date spending in
2024 on a medical research project. Research and development expenses decreased 39,232, or 22.9 , from 171,536 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 132,304 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher year-to-date spending in
2023 on a medical research project. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses decreased 1,270,356, or 38.2 , from 3,323,352 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 2,052,996
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to 2023 post-IPO consulting and recruiting services and the payment of incentive
bonuses relating to the 2023 IPO that did not recur in 2024, partially offset by (i) incremental headcount to build out the market access,
sales and finance teams including, (ii) 2024 one-time non-cash advisory costs, (iii) expenses related to the introduction of an annual
short-term incentive bonus plan in 2024 and (iv) higher advertising costs in order to expand market awareness. 

General
and administrative expenses increased 682,947, or 10.8 , from 6,316,411 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 6,999,358
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to (i) higher legal, insurance, investor relation, board of director and exchange
listing costs as a publicly held entity that the Company did not incur prior to its IPO, (ii) incremental headcount to build out the
market access, sales and finance teams, (iii) severance charges related to the Company s prior Chief Operating Officer, (iv) one-time
non-cash advisory costs, (v) a one-time non-cash stock compensation charge of 227,000 as a hiring grant, (vi) expenses related to the
introduction of an annual short-term incentive bonus program, and (vii) higher advertising costs in order to expand market awareness,
partially offset by non-recurrence of 2023 post-IPO consulting and recruiting services and the payment of incentive bonuses relating
to the 2023 IPO. 

Operating
Loss 

Our
operating loss decreased 1,371,066, or 45.4 , from 3,022,339 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,651,273 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the absence of 2023 post-IPO consulting and recruiting services, 2023 incentive bonuses
relating to the IPO and higher sales and gross profit in 2024, partially offset by incremental headcount, advisory costs, a new annual
short-term incentive bonus plan and higher advertising costs in 2024. Our operating loss increased 648,935, or 12.9 , from 5,041,290
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 5,690,225 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to new costs as a publicly
held company that were not incurred prior to the 2023 IPO. 

Other
(Expense) Income, Net 

Other
expense decreased 5,499,063, or 98.1 , from 5,603,024 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 103,961 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the full conversion of the convertible notes upon the IPO on August 9, 2023, that eliminated
any further debt discount, issuance cost and fair value derivative valuation net charges and lower interest expense and issuance cost
amortization from a lower debt burden in 2024. 

Other
expense decreased 6,889,724, or 86.2 , from 7,993,095 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,103,371 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the full conversion of the convertible notes upon the IPO on August 9, 2023, that eliminated
any further debt discount, issuance cost, debt extinguishment and fair value derivative valuation net charges and lower interest expense
and issuance cost amortization from a lower debt burden in 2024, partially offset by financing charges incurred to settle a 2023 convertible
note dispute and other expense to settle certain claims of pre-IPO Series A Preferred Stock shareholders. 

Net
Loss 

Our
net loss decreased 6,870,129, or 79.7 , from 8,625,363 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,755,234 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024. Our net loss decreased 6,240,789, or 47.9 , from 13,034,385 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, to 6,793,596 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decreases were primarily due to (i) higher sales for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, (ii) lower general and administrative
expenses due to the absence of 2023 post-IPO consulting and recruiting services and the payment of incentive bonuses relating to the
2023 IPO, (iii) the elimination of debt discount, issuance cost and fair value derivative valuation net charges as a result of the
conversion of notes upon the 2023 IPO and (iv) lower interest expense and issuance cost amortization from a lower debt burden in
2024, partially offset by financing charges incurred to settle a 2023 convertible note dispute and other expense to settle certain
claims of pre-IPO Series A Preferred Stock shareholders.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
had cash on hand of 260,885 and 761,249 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We maintained a working capital deficit of
 2,032,284 and 1,643,058 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in working capital was primarily
due to the unpaid severance, annual bonus and consulting fees that were not incurred in 2023. 

We
have incurred losses since inception and have funded our operations primarily with a combination of sales, debt, and the sale of capital
stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 1,793,932 and short-term borrowings of 147,688. 

Our
future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing, and marketing our technologies,
the time and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights,
our ability to establish collaborative arrangements, marketing activities and competing technological and market developments, including
regulatory changes and overall economic conditions in our target markets. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability requires
us to successfully market and secure purchase orders for our products from customers currently identified in our sales pipeline and to
new customers as well. The primary activity that will drive all customers and revenues is the adoption of insurance coverage by commercial
insurance carriers nationally, so this is a top priority of the Company. These activities, including our planned research and development
efforts, will require significant uses of working capital through the rest of 2024 and beyond. 

Additionally,
we have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. Our
management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements,
especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit
the amount of time our management has to implement our business plan and may delay our anticipated growth plans. 

The
following table summarizes our cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023:

Investing
Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased 27,965, or 50.2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower capital expenditures. 

Financing
Activities Net cash provided by financing activities decreased 77,512, or 1.7 , for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes in
2024 compared to the net IPO and notes payable proceeds in 2023.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Application of U.S. GAAP and Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
the effectiveness of our (i) controls over the application of U.S. GAAP based on guidance and interpretations issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board through the Accounting Standards Codification and Accounting Standards Updates and (ii) disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September
30, 2024, our U.S. GAAP reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that information required to
be reported under U.S. GAAP and disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i)
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal accounting officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Due
to accounting resource constraints, we have had limited review controls. These constraints have resulted in (i) a lack of segregation
of duties since we have a limited administrative staff, (ii) a lack of internal controls structure review and (iii) a restatement of
our unaudited financial statements as of and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023. As a result of these constraints,
we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financing reporting as of September 30, 2024. 

The
Company s assessment identified certain material weaknesses which are set forth below: 

Functional
Controls and Segregation of Duties 

Because
of the Company s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing. Additionally, there is inadequate segregation
of duties consistent with control objectives. Our management is composed of a small number of individuals resulting in a situation where
limitations on segregation of duties exist. All responsibility for accounting entries and the creation of financial statements is held
by a single person, though the Company engages multiple accounting consultants for accounting, tax and audit support. To remedy this
situation, we hired additional staff to facilitate greater segregation of duties. 

Accordingly,
as the result of identifying the above material weakness we have concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the
Company s internal controls. 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth above were the result of the scale of our operations and are intrinsic to our small size.
Management continues to take actions to remedy these weaknesses, including the review of current staff, reassignment of duties, and continued
hiring of additional staff to create the necessary segregation of duties to improve controls over information processing. 

Remediation
Plan 

We
are starting the process of documenting, reviewing and improving our internal controls and procedures for compliance with Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
To comply with the requirements of being a public company, the Company has undertaken various actions including the hiring of additional
staff, and will take additional actions, such as remediating the material weaknesses described above, implementing additional internal
controls and procedures and hiring personnel or financial consultants, as needed. While we believe that these remediation actions will
improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, the material weakness identified will not be considered remediated
until the controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we cannot provide assurance that the measures we have taken to date,
or any measures we may take in the future will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness we have identified or avoid potential
future material weaknesses. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the remediation efforts described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter
ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability material
to our financial condition as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required.
The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a significant diversion of our resources, and there is no guarantee
that we will be able to successfully defend against any such litigation regardless of particular merits. There also may be adverse publicity
associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are
valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. Insurance may not be available on favorable terms, at all, or in sufficient amounts
to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for
any claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition and the results of our operations.

 Conversion at Option of Holder . Each Holder may, at its option, at any time and from time to time, elect to convert each share
of Preferred Stock plus accrued, but unpaid dividends thereon, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock
as is determined by dividing the Stated Value by the Conversion Price in effect on the Conversion Date. The Conversion Price 
shall initially be equal to 2.38. Such initial Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Preferred Stock plus accrued, but unpaid
dividends thereon, may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below. 

(b)
 Mechanics of Conversion . Holders shall effect conversions by providing the Corporation with the form of conversion notice attached
hereto as Annex A (the Notice of Conversion ). Each Notice of Conversion shall specify the number of shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned prior to the conversion at issue, the number of shares of Preferred
Stock owned subsequent to the conversion at issue and the date on which such conversion is to be effected, which date may not be prior
to the date the applicable Holder delivers by facsimile such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation (such date, the Conversion
Date ). If no Conversion Date is specified in a Notice of Conversion, the Conversion Date shall be the date that such Notice
of Conversion to the Corporation is deemed delivered hereunder. No ink-original Notice of Conversion shall be required, nor shall any
medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Conversion from be required. The calculations and entries
set forth in the Notice of Conversion shall control in the absence of manifest or mathematical error. To effect conversions of shares
of Preferred Stock, a Holder shall not be required to surrender the certificate(s) representing the shares of Preferred Stock to the
Corporation unless all of the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby are so converted, in which case such Holder shall deliver
the certificate representing such shares of Preferred Stock promptly following the Conversion Date at issue. As soon as practicable after
the Conversion Date, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such Holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates
for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, together with cash
as provided in Section 7(d) in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion (if applicable)
and the payment of any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted. Such converted Preferred Stock shall
be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action
(without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of its preferred stock accordingly. 

(c)
 Reserve Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The Corporation covenants that it will reserve a sufficient number of shares of Common
Stock for issuance to the Holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. The Corporation further covenants that all shares of Common
Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

(d)
 Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Corporation shall
at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. 

(e)
 Transfer Taxes and Expenses . The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be made without charge
to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares,
provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involving the issuance
and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holders of such shares of Preferred Stock
and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting
the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation
such tax has been paid. 

(f)
 Ownership Cap . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holder shall not be entitled to receive Common Shares
to the extent (but only to the extent) that such conversion or receipt would cause the Holder Group (as defined below) to become, directly
or indirectly, a beneficial owner (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder) of a number of Common Shares of a class that is registered under the 1934 Act which exceeds the Maximum Percentage of the
Common Shares of such class that are outstanding at such time. For purposes of this Section 7(f) , (i) the term Maximum
Percentage shall initially be set at the discretion of each Holder to a percentage designated by such Holder on its signature
page to the Purchase Agreement between 4.99 and 19.99 until the date the Stockholder approval is obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
by written notice to the Corporation (which may be by email), (i) which will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st day after
such written notice is delivered to the Corporation, the Holder may reset the Maximum Percentage to a higher percentage, not to exceed
19.99 until the date the Stockholder Approval is obtained, to the extent applicable, and (ii) which will be effective immediately after
such notice is delivered to the Corporation, the Holder may reset the Maximum Percentage to a lower percentage and (ii) the term Holder
Group shall mean the Holder plus any other Person with which the Holder is considered to be part of a group under Section 13 of
the 1934 Act or with which the Holder otherwise files reports under Sections13 and/or 16 of the 1934 Act. In determining the number of
Common Shares of a particular class outstanding at any point in time, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding Common Shares
of such class as reflected in (x) the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, each filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the case may be, (y)a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) a more recent
notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent to the Holder setting forth the number of Common Shares of such class then outstanding. For
any reason at any time, upon written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall, within one (1) Business Day of such request, confirm
orally and in writing to the Holder the number of Common Shares of any class then outstanding. 

Section
8. Adjustments . 

(a)
 Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Corporation, at any time while the Preferred Stock is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend
or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any other Common Stock
Equivalents (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation upon conversion of
the Preferred Stock), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by
way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification
of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction
of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) outstanding immediately
before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event.
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 8(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination
of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in
the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.

 Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while the Preferred Stock is outstanding, (i) the Corporation, directly or indirectly,
in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another Person, (ii) the Corporation,
directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially
all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange
offer (whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender
or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50 or more of the outstanding
Common Stock, (iv) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization
or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted
into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions
consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization,
spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50 of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or
affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a Fundamental
Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for
each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction
(without regard to any limitation on the conversion of the Preferred Stock), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or
acquiring corporation or of the Corporation, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the Alternate
Consideration receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock
for which the Preferred Stock is convertible immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation on the
conversion of the Preferred Stock). For purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Conversion Price shall be appropriately
adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of
Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Corporation shall apportion the Conversion Price among the Alternate Consideration
in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common
Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall
be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any conversion of the Preferred Stock following such Fundamental
Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in
such Fundamental Transaction shall file a new Certificate of Designation with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders
new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holders right to convert such preferred stock
into Alternate Consideration. The Corporation shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Corporation
is not the survivor to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation and the Settlement
Agreement in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8(b) . 

(c)
 Calculations . All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 100th of a share,
as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 8 , the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as
of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) issued and
outstanding. 

(d)
 Notice to Holders . 

(i)
 Adjustments . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 8 , the Corporation shall
promptly deliver to each Holder a notice setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement
of the facts requiring such adjustment.

on the Common Stock, (B) the Corporation shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C)

that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other
property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange, provided that the failure to
deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to

and Exchange Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled to convert the Preferred Stock (or

maximum rate of interest permitted by law. 

(f)
 Next Business Day . Whenever any payment or other obligation hereunder shall be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. 

(g)
