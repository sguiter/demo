NEW YORK REIT LIQUIDATING LLC NOTE S TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2024 (unaudited) million cash reserve established in 2017 from the proceeds of our sale of a interest in Worldwide Plaza refer to amounts held by the Company and not by ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC. For example, statements such as our sole remaining property-related asset is a ownership interest in Worldwide Plaza, our interest in Worldwide Plaza, our joint venture partner in Worldwide Plaza, and similar statements refer to ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC s interests, activities, rights and obligations, and partner with respect to Worldwide Plaza. New York REIT Liquidating LLC (the Company was formed on November 7, 2018 and is the successor entity to New York REIT, Inc., (the Predecessor ). The Predecessor was incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation that qualified as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes REIT beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2010. On April 15, 2014, the Predecessor listed its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the symbol NYRT . The sole purpose of the Company is to wind up the Company s affairs and the liquidation of the Company s assets with no objective to continue or to engage in the conduct of a trade or business, except as necessary for the orderly liquidation of the Company s assets. On August 22, 2016, the Predecessor s Board of Directors (the Board approved a plan of liquidation to sell in an orderly manner all or substantially all of the assets of the Predecessor and its operating partnership, New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the OP ), and to liquidate and dissolve the Predecessor and the OP (the Liquidation Plan ), subject to stockholder approval (see Note 2).

 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 . The decrease was primarily due to a million net decrease due to a remeasurement of estimated receipts and costs primarily related to an increase of estimated legal fees and a decrease in estimated interest income to be earned on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. The decrease was offset by an increase of million in the estimated liquidation value of the Company s investment in Worldwide Plaza resulting from the estimated distributions to be received from working capital at the property and interest thereon. Net assets in liquidation decreased by million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The decrease was primarily due to a million net decrease due to a remeasurement of estimated receipts and costs primarily related to an increase of estimated legal fees and a decrease in estimated interest income to be earned on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. The decrease was offset by an increase of million in the estimated liquidation value of the Company s investment in Worldwide Plaza resulting from the estimated distributions to be received from working capital at the property and interest thereon. Net assets in liquidation increased by million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was primarily due to a net increase of million in the estimated liquidation value of the Company s investment in Worldwide Plaza primarily resulting from an increase in estimated distributions from working capital and property operations and a million net increase due to a remeasurement of estimated receipts and costs primarily related to an increase of estimated interest income. Net assets in liquidation increased by million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was primarily due to an increase of million in the estimated liquidation value of the Company s investment in Worldwide Plaza resulting from the estimated distributions to be received from working capital at the property and property operations and a million net increase due to a remeasurement of estimated receipts and costs primarily related to an increase of estimated interest income.

 Units outstanding at September 30, 2024. The net assets in liquidation as of September 30, 2024, if sold at their net asset value, would result in liquidating distributions of approximately per Unit. The net assets in liquidation as of September 30, 2024 of million , if sold at their net asset value, plus the cumulative liquidating distributions paid to stockholders of billion per common share/Unit) prior to September 30, 2024 would result in cumulative liquidating distributions to stockholders/unitholders of per Unit. There is inherent uncertainty with these estimates, and they could change materially based on the timing of the sale of the Company s remaining assets, the performance of the underlying assets and any changes in the underlying assumptions of the estimated cash flows. 
 equity interest in Worldwide Plaza for a contract purchase price of million, based on the property value at that time for Worldwide Plaza of billion less million of debt on the property. On June 1, 2017, the Predecessor acquired an additional equity interest on exercise of the Predecessor s option to purchase pursuant to the Company s rights under the joint venture agreement of Worldwide Plaza for a contract purchase price of million, based on the option price of approximately billion less million of debt on the property. The Predecessor s joint venture partner exercised its right to retain of the aggregate membership interests in Worldwide Plaza. Following the exercise of the option, the Predecessor owned a total equity interest of in Worldwide Plaza. On October 18, 2017, the Predecessor sold a interest in Worldwide Plaza to WWP JV LLC, a joint venture managed by SL Green Realty Corp. and RXR Realty LLC based on an estimated underlying property value of billion. In conjunction with the equity sale, there was a concurrent billion refinancing of the existing Worldwide Plaza debt. The Predecessor received cash at closing of approximately million from the sale and excess proceeds from the financing, net of closing costs which included million of defeasance and prepayment costs. The new debt on Worldwide Plaza bears interest at a blended rate of approximately per annum, requires monthly payments of interest only and matures in . As the space previously leased by Cravath, Swaine Moore, LLP Cravath has not been sufficiently re-leased on terms that would generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy debt service requirements, the joint venture that owns Worldwide Plaza is currently restricted from making distributions under the terms of its indebtedness. The lender initiated a cash sweep in September 2023 and, as a result, all rent payments are being directed to the sweep account and the lender controls disbursements to cover operating expenditures and capital improvements at Worldwide Plaza. The lease with Cravath expired on August 31, 2024 and interest on the mezzanine debt has not been paid since August 6, 2024. On September 13, 2024, ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC received a copy of a default notice to WWP Mezz, LLC, a subsidiary of WWP Holdings LLC, as borrower under a million mezzanine first loan, as a result of failure by the borrower to make a required interest payment of million under the loan agreement. The borrower has entered into pre-negotiation agreements with the lenders and has begun discussions on potential loan modifications. The Company initially set aside approximately million from the 2017 refinancing proceeds to cover our share of potential future leasing and capital costs at the property as discussed in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies . The Company believes that there is no obligation to reserve this amount, and even if such an obligation existed, it has lapsed. We filed an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking a declaratory judgment that we are permitted to distribute the reserved funds; that action has been stayed pending resolution of an action brought by ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC in the New York Supreme Court. Following the sale of its interest discussed above, the Company now holds a interest in Worldwide Plaza. The Company has determined that this investment is an investment in a VIE. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE since the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. The Company accounts for this investment using the equity method of accounting. The lease with one of the tenants at the Worldwide Plaza property contains a right of first offer if Worldwide Plaza sells of the property. The right requires Worldwide Plaza to offer the tenant the option to purchase of the Worldwide Plaza property, at 

7 

NEW YORK REIT LIQUIDATING LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2024 (unaudited) 
 days, that tenant does not accept the offer, Worldwide Plaza may then sell the property to a third party, provided that Worldwide Plaza will be required to re-offer the property to that tenant if it desires to sell the property for a purchase price (and other economic consideration) less than of the initial purchase price contained in the offer to that tenant. We have a right to transfer our membership interests in Worldwide Plaza to purchasers meeting certain qualifications, subject to a right of first offer to our joint venture partner. Commencing January 18, 2022, we and our joint venture partner also have the right to require the joint venture to market the property it owns for sale, subject to a right of first offer to our joint venture partner. Any transferee of our interest would acquire an interest subject to the same limitations on participation in the management of Worldwide Plaza that apply to us. There can be no assurance these limitations will not affect our ability to sell our interest in Worldwide Plaza or the amount we would receive on a sale. In addition, we may determine that a sale of the property rather than our interest in Worldwide Plaza is the best way to maximize the value of our interest in Worldwide Plaza. A sale of the property could substantially delay the timing of our complete liquidation. Additionally, the existence of the right of first offers may delay our ability to sell the Worldwide Plaza property or our interest in Worldwide Plaza on terms and in the timeframe of our choosing and may diminish the price we receive on a sale . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , rent from Nomura Holdings America, Inc. Nomura represented of the total annualized cash rent at Worldwide Plaza, excluding any rent from Cravath, whose lease terminated August 31, 2024. The termination, delinquency or non-renewal of Nomura would have a material effect on the Company s operations. With the termination of the Cravath lease, Nomura is the only tenan t at Worldwide Plaza whose annualized cash rent represents greater than 10 of the total annualized cash rent at the property . There are tenants whose annualized cash rent represented greater than 10 of total annualized cash rent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Nomura rent represented and of the total annualized cash rent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Cravath rent represented and of total annualized cash rent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lease with Cravath expired on and the space as not been re-leased. The expiration of this lease will have a material adverse effect on the Company s operations. See "Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies" for a discussion of legal proceedings. The amounts reflected in the following tables are based on the going concern basis financial information of Worldwide Plaza. Under liquidation accounting, equity investments are carried at net realizable value.

 million (the Reserve that was established in 2017 in connection with a transaction between the Company s subsidiary, ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC, and WWP JV LLC relating to a proposed investment in Worldwide Plaza, an office and retail mixed-use project located in midtown Manhattan. On May 11, 2023, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued a stay of the case, pending resolution of the New York litigation filed by the Company's subsidiary, ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC, as described below. The Company s subsidiary, ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC filed suit against WWP JV LLC on December 22, 2022. The suit is captioned ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC v. WWP JV LLC, (Sup. Ct. N.Y. County), and, on February 10, 2023, the Company was named as Counterclaim Defendant and Third-Party Defendant in such action. ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC has sought declaratory relief that it need not fund certain disputed capital contributions exceeding million under the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of WWP Holdings, LLC LLC Agreement related to proposed capital improvements at Worldwide Plaza, because it is ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC's position that the Initial Budget expired at year end 2018 and the subject capital improvements would require a new Annual Budget that has received Board Approval, which has not occurred. WWP JV LLC s counterclaim against the Company seeks declaratory relief that the Company must continue to maintain the Reserve until such time as a member of WWP Holdings, LLC issues a call notice for the Reserve under the LLC Agreement (the Counterclaim ). WWP JV LLC s third party claims against the Company assert claims under various theories of tort and unjust enrichment and seek damages in excess of million (the Third Party Claims ). The Supreme Court, New York County dismissed the Third Party Claims against the Company on November 14, 2023; WWP JV LLC has appealed that dismissal. It is the Company's and ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC's position that the

On October 30, 2020, the Advisory Agreement was amended to reduce the monthly fee payable to the Winthrop Advisor to effective August 1, 2020. All other terms of the Advisory Agreement remained unchanged. In connection with the adoption of liquidation accounting, the Company accrues costs it expects to incur through the end of liquidation. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company has accrued asset management fees and compensation reimbursements totaling million payable to the Winthrop Advisor representing management s estimate of future asset management fees to final liquidation, provided there is no assurance that the contract will continue to be extended at the same terms, if at all. This amount is included in estimated costs during liquidation. In connection with the payment of (i) any distributions of money or other property by the Company to its stockholders or unitholders during the term of the Advisory Agreement and (ii) any other amounts paid to the Company s stockholders or unitholders on account of their shares of common stock or membership interests in the Company in connection with a merger or other change in control transaction pursuant to an agreement with the Company entered into after March 8, 2017 (such distributions and payments, the Hurdle Payments ), in excess of per share (adjusted for the Reverse Split, the Hurdle Amount ), when taken together with all other Hurdle Payments, the Company will pay an incentive fee to the Winthrop Advisor in an amount equal to of such excess (the Incentive Fee ). The Hurdle Amount will be increased on an annualized basis by an amount equal to the product of (a) the Treasury Rate plus 200 basis points and (b) the Hurdle Amount minus all previous Hurdle Payments.

 Item 2. M anagement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of New York REIT Liquidating LLC and the notes thereto. As used herein, the terms Company, we, our and us refer to New York REIT Liquidating LLC, and its consolidated subsidiaries and, as required by context to New York REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the Predecessor ), to New York Recovery Operating Partnership L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the OP ), and to their subsidiaries. References to the Company s ownership, investment in, and rights and obligations and actions with respect to WWP Holdings LLC or Worldwide Plaza refer to the interests, rights and obligations, and actions of the Company s subsidiary ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC, except that references relating to the 90.7 million cash reserve established in 2017 from the proceeds of our sale of a 48.7 interest in Worldwide Plaza refer to amounts held by the Company and not by ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC. For example, statements such as our sole remaining property-related asset is a 50.1 ownership interest in Worldwide Plaza , our interest in Worldwide Plaza , our joint venture partner in Worldwide Plaza , and similar statements refer to ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC s interests, activities, rights and obligations, and partner with respect to Worldwide Plaza. Since March 8, 2017, we have been externally managed by Winthrop REIT Advisors, LLC (the Winthrop Advisor ). Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined have the meaning ascribed to those terms in Part I Financial Information included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and contained herein. Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements contained herein constitute forward-looking statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our future results, financial condition and business may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as approximates, believes, estimates, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, should, would, will, may or similar expressions in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Many of the factors that will determine these items are beyond our ability to control or predict. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, public health crises, as well as those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors, as well as our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based on information, judgments and estimates at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a discussion of our unaudited consolidated interim financial statements and notes thereto. These unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Overview On August 22, 2016, the Board approved a plan of liquidation to sell in an orderly manner all or substantially all of its assets and the assets of the OP (the Liquidation Plan ), subject to stockholder approval. The Liquidation Plan was approved at a special meeting of stockholders on January 3, 2017. The Liquidation Plan provides for an orderly sale of the Predecessor's assets, payment of its liabilities and other obligations, and the winding down of operations and the dissolution of the Company. We are no longer permitted to make any new investments except to make protective acquisitions on advances with respect to our existing assets. We are permitted to satisfy any existing contractual obligations and pay for required tenant improvements and capital expenditures at our real estate property owned by the joint venture in which we own an interest. In order to comply with applicable tax laws, the Predecessor converted into a limited liability company known as New York REIT Liquidating LLC. The conversion to the Company was approved by the stockholders on September 7, 2018 and became effective on 

 12 

NEW YORK REIT LIQUIDATING LLC September 30, 2024 
 November 7, 2018. The Liquidation Plan enables us to sell our assets without further approval of the stockholders or unitholders and provides that liquidating distributions be made to the stockholders as determined by the Board, and following the conversion, to our unitholders as determined by the Board of Managers. In October 2018, the Predecessor announced the withdrawal of its common stock from listing on the NYSE in connection with the conversion. November 2, 2018 was the last day on which shares of its common stock were traded on the NYSE and its stock transfer books were closed as of 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on such date. At the effective time of the conversion, each outstanding share of common stock of the Predecessor was converted into one unit of common membership interest in the Company (a Unit ), and holders of shares of our common stock automatically received one Unit (which Unit was in book entry form) for each share of the Predecessor s common stock held by such stockholder. Unlike shares of the Predecessor s common stock, which, in addition to being listed on the NYSE, were freely transferable, Units are not listed for trading and generally are not transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law. Therefore, the holders of Units do not have the ability to realize any value from these interests except from distributions made by the Company, the timing of which will be solely in the discretion of the Board of Managers. The Company is deemed to be the same entity as the Predecessor with the same assets and liabilities as the Predecessor on the date of conversion. In addition, the charter and bylaws of the Predecessor were replaced by the operating agreement of the Company. For tax purposes, the fair value of each Unit in the Company received by stockholders when the conversion became effective, which reflects the value of the remaining assets of the Company (net of liabilities), was 14.00 per Unit and was equal to the average of the high and low trading prices for shares of the Predecessor s common stock on the last three days on which the shares were traded on the NYSE. For a detailed description of the federal income tax and investment considerations relating to the conversion and its effects on our interests in the Predecessor, please see the Predecessor s proxy statement/prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 6, 2018. The business of the Company is the same as the business of the Predecessor immediately preceding the conversion, which, consistent with the Liquidation Plan, consists of the continued ownership of the Predecessor s interest in Worldwide Plaza, the only remaining property-related asset. Under its operating agreement, the business and affairs of the Company will be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Managers, and the sole purpose is winding up the affairs of the Company and the liquidation of its remaining property-related asset. On November 6, 2023, pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement of the Company, the Board of Managers extended the term of the Company such that the Company will remain in existence until the earlier of (i) the distribution of all company assets pursuant to liquidation or (ii) December 31, 2024. The dissolution process and the amount and timing of distributions to unitholders involves risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, it is impossible to predict the timing or aggregate amount which will be ultimately distributed to unitholders, and no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets presented in the Consolidated Statements of Net Assets. To date, liquidating distributions totaling 61.83 per common share/Unit have been paid. Liquidation Plan As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, all of our property-related assets have been sold except our remaining interest in Worldwide Plaza. For purposes of liquidation accounting, our estimate of net assets in liquidation value assumes a sale of Worldwide Plaza at September 30, 2025, which is based on estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates as well as available market information and assumptions regarding capital expenditures. The actual timing of sale has not yet been determined and is subject to future events and uncertainties. These estimates are subject to change based on the actual timing of the sale of our remaining interest in Worldwide Plaza and the actual cash distributions received from the property during our holding period. The net assets in liquidation of 117.2 million at September 30, 2024 are presented on an undiscounted basis. Net operating income at Worldwide Plaza remained relatively steady through August 31, 2024. The lease with Cravath expired on August 31, 2024, and net operating income will be materially negatively impacted until such time as the space can be re-leased. We will continue to monitor the market and adjust the net realizable value of the investment, if necessary, at each reporting period. The timing of the sale of the property, and the ultimate value we receive from the sale, are subject to change. We initially set aside approximately 90.7 million from the 2017 refinancing proceeds to cover our share of potential future leasing and capital costs at the property; as discussed in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies, we believe that any obligation to reserve this amount has lapsed and we are seeking a declaratory judgment in the Delaware Court of Chancery that we are permitted to distribute the reserved funds. The Delaware proceedings have been stayed, pending resolution of proceedings in New York initiated by the Company's subsidiary, ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC.

NEW YORK REIT LIQUIDATING LLC September 30, 2024 
 Current Activity There were no property sales for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, and cash equivalents and restricted cash aggregating 92.1 million. Our total assets and undiscounted net assets in liquidation were 120.4 million and 117.2 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. Our principal demands for funds are to pay or fund operating expenses, capital expenditures and liquidating distributions to our unitholders. We believe that our current cash balance plus interest earned on our cash balances will continue to provide adequate capital to fund our operating, administrative and other expenses incurred during liquidation, excluding legal costs. We estimate that our current cash balance plus estimated interest earned is sufficient to cover approximately two years of operating expenses, excluding legal costs, at the Company. As the space previously leased by Cravath has not been sufficiently re-leased on terms that would generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy debt service requirements, the joint venture that owns Worldwide Plaza is currently restricted from making distributions under the terms of its indebtedness. The lender initiated a cash sweep in September 2023 and, as a result, all rent payments are being directed to the sweep account and the lender controls disbursements to cover operating expenditures and capital improvements at Worldwide Plaza. Any excess funds are retained in a lender-controlled account to be utilized to cover future operating cash shortfalls at the property. The lease with Cravath expired on August 31, 2024 and interest on the mezzanine debt has not been paid since August 6, 2024. On September 13, 2024, ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC received a copy of a default notice to WWP Mezz, LLC, a subsidiary of WWP Holdings LLC, as borrower under a 190.0 million mezzanine first loan, as a result of failure by the borrower to make a required interest payment of 0.8 million under the loan agreement. The borrower has entered into pre-negotiation agreements with the lenders and has begun discussions on potential loan modifications. The cash sweep will continue until such time as specific leasing conditions have been met or an amount equal to approximately 42.3 million has been deposited into an account to fund lease commissions and tenant improvements. Even though our joint venture partner in Worldwide Plaza has informed us that it does not intend to make any further distributions to the joint venture partners, we will likely be able to satisfy our current operating, administrative and other expenses; however, liquidating distributions to our unitholders will likely be suspended or reduced accordingly. Our principal sources and uses of funds are further described below. Principal Sources of Funds Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level at Worldwide Plaza, the net effective rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent, operating escalations and recoveries from our tenants at Worldwide Plaza and the level of operating and other costs, including general and administrative expenses and other expenses associated with carrying out our Liquidation Plan. As discussed above, the lender initiated a cash sweep in September 2023 which restricts the joint venture that owns Worldwide Plaza from making distributions. Prior to initiation of the cash sweep, our joint venture partner in Worldwide Plaza suspended making current distributions to the joint venture partners and reserved all excess cash flow from the property. The Company has filed an action for declaratory judgment in the New York Supreme Court contesting our joint venture partner's right to do so. Sales Proceeds In connection with the Liquidation Plan, we plan to sell our remaining 50.1 interest in Worldwide Plaza. Other Sources of Funds During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net distributions of 155,000 in respect of our interest in Worldwide Plaza. Principal Use of Funds Capital Expenditures As of September 30, 2024, we owned a 50.1 interest in the joint venture that owns Worldwide Plaza. In connection with the leasing of the property, the joint venture entered into agreements with its tenants to provide allowances for tenant improvements. These 

 14 

NEW YORK REIT LIQUIDATING LLC September 30, 2024 
 allowances require the joint venture to fund capital expenditures up to amounts specified in the lease agreements. Our share of capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was funded from property cash flow. We initially set aside approximately 90.7 million from the 2017 refinancing proceeds to cover our share of potential future leasing and capital costs at the property; as discussed in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies we believe that any obligation to reserve this amount has lapsed, and we are seeking a declaratory judgment in the Delaware Court of Chancery that we are permitted to distribute the reserved funds; those Delaware proceedings have been stayed pending resolution of proceedings in New York initiated by the Company's subsidiary, ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC. Liquidating Distributions Until such time as we are able to dispose of our remaining asset, the actual amount and timing of, and record dates for, future liquidating distributions will be determined by our Board of Managers and will depend upon the timing and amount of cash flow distributions we receive from our Worldwide Plaza joint venture and the amounts deemed necessary by our Board of Managers to pay or provide for our liabilities and obligations. The timing and amount of our final liquidating distribution will be dependent on the timing and proceeds of the sale of our remaining interest in Worldwide Plaza and the timing of the resolution of the litigations, discussed in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies. As the Company is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes, any such liquidating distributions on the Units will be deemed a return of capital . Loan Obligations We have no consolidated mortgage notes payable as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had 601.2 million of unconsolidated mortgage debt reflecting our pro rata share of Worldwide Plaza's total mortgage debt of 1.2 billion. The Worldwide Plaza mortgage debt matures in November 2027 and requires monthly interest-only payments. Operating cash flow at the property was sufficient to cover the monthly debt service payments through August 2024. The lease with Cravath expired on August 31, 2024 and operating cash flow at the property is no longer sufficient to cover property operations and debt service payments. Interest on the Worldwide Plaza mezzanine debt has not been paid since August 6, 2024. On September 13, 2024, ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC received a copy of a default notice to WWP Mezz, LLC, a subsidiary of WWP Holdings LLC, as borrower under a 190.0 million mezzanine first loan, as a result of failure by the borrower to make a required interest payment of 0.8 million under the loan agreement. The borrower has entered into pre-negotiation agreements with the lenders and has begun discussions on potential loan modifications. Cash Flows Our level of liquidity based upon cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by approximately 3.2 million from 95.3 million at December 31, 2023 to 92.1 million at September 30, 2024. The holders of shares of common stock of the Predecessor approved the Liquidation Plan on January 3, 2017, and we adopted the liquidation basis of accounting effective January 1, 2017. We did not make any acquisitions in new investments during 2023 or the first nine months ended September 30, 2024, and, in accordance with the Liquidation Plan, no further acquisitions are expected. We had no sources or uses of non-operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Contractual Obligations We did not have any contractual debt or lease obligations as of September 30, 2024. Comparability of Financial Data from Period to Period Results of Operations Our remaining property asset continued to perform in a manner that was relatively consistent with prior reporting periods through August 31, 2024. With the expiration of the Cravath lease, we have experienced a significant decrease in occupancy at Worldwide Plaza. Occupancy and Leasing As of September 30, 2024, Worldwide Plaza was 62.8 leased, compared to 91.5 as of September 30, 2023. The lease with Cravath expired on August 31, 2024. This vacancy will have a material adverse effect on Worldwide Plaza s operations until such time as the space has been re-leased. 

 15 

NEW YORK REIT LIQUIDATING LLC September 30, 2024 
 Changes in Net Assets in Liquidation Net assets in liquidation decreased by 1.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.8 million net decrease due to a remeasurement of estimated receipts and costs primarily related to an increase of estimated legal fees and a decrease in estimated interest income to be earned on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. The decrease was offset by an increase of 0.3 million in the estimated liquidation value of the Company s investment in Worldwide Plaza resulting from the estimated distributions to be received from working capital at the property and property operations. Net assets in liquidation decreased by 5.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a 6.8 million net decrease due to a remeasurement of estimated receipts and costs primarily related to an increase of estimated legal fees and a decrease in estimated interest income to be earned on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. The decrease was offset by an increase of 0.9 million in the estimated liquidation value of the Company s investment in Worldwide Plaza resulting from the estimated distributions to be received from working capital at the property and interest thereon. Net assets in liquidation increased by 4.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a net increase of 4.3 million in the estimated liquidation value of the Company s investment in Worldwide Plaza primarily resulting from an increase in estimated distributions from working capital and property operations and a 0.3 million net increase due to a remeasurement of estimated receipts and costs primarily related to an increase of estimated interest income. Net assets in liquidation increased by 10.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 9.0 million in the estimated liquidation value of the Company s investment in Worldwide Plaza resulting from the estimated distributions to be received from working capital at the property and property operations and a 1.4 million net increase due to a remeasurement of estimated receipts and costs primarily related to an increase of estimated interest income. Net assets in liquidation at September 30, 2024, which are presented on an undiscounted basis, include Worldwide Plaza value based on estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates as well as available market information and assumptions regarding capital expenditures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, assuming we dispose of our investment in the next 12 months, resulting in estimated future liquidating distributions of approximately 6.98 per Unit. This estimate of liquidating distributions includes projections of costs and expenses to be incurred during the next 12 months and costs to dispose of the Company s remaining investment in WWP. Any changes in the future market value of Worldwide Plaza, if any, will be evaluated at each reporting period and will be reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Net Assets in liquidation at such times. Like any estimate or projection, management's estimate is subject to various assumptions and uncertainties including the joint venture s ability to execute on the business plan, tenants paying their rental obligations, the equity capital and financing markets and New York City market conditions generally. Our unaudited financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are prepared on the liquidation basis of accounting and accordingly include an estimate of the liquidation value of our assets and other estimates, including estimates of anticipated cash flow, timing of asset sales and liquidation expenses. These estimates update estimates that we have previously provided. These estimates are based on multiple assumptions, some of which may prove to be incorrect, and the actual amount of liquidating distributions we pay to you may be more or less than these estimates. We cannot assure you of the actual amount or timing of liquidating distributions you will receive pursuant to the Liquidation Plan. Tax Status We are taxed as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly, no provision or benefit for income taxes is made in the consolidated financial statements. All distributions from the Company will be considered a return of capital for tax purposes. Unitholders will receive a Schedule K-1 from the Company annually reflecting their allocable share of the Company s income, loss, gains and deductions. Inflation Many of Worldwide Plaza s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures). We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions.

NEW YORK REIT LIQUIDATING LLC September 30, 2024 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance-sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Subsequent to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan, we are required to estimate all costs and income we expect to incur and earn through the end of liquidation including the estimated amount of cash we expect to collect on the disposal of our assets and the estimated costs to dispose of our assets. Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture We account for our investment in unconsolidated joint venture under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control the entity and are not considered to be the primary beneficiary. Under liquidation accounting, the investment in unconsolidated joint venture is recorded at its liquidation value, or net realizable value, comprised of an estimate of the expected sale proceeds upon disposition plus the estimated net cash flow to be received from the venture during the liquidation period. We evaluate the net realizable value of our unconsolidated joint venture at each reporting period. Any changes in net realizable value will be reflected as a change in our net assets in liquidation. The liquidation value of our remaining investment in Worldwide Plaza at September 30, 2024 is based on estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates as well as available market information and assumptions regarding capital expenditures assuming we dispose of our investment in the next 12 months. Recent Accounting Pronouncement There are no new accounting pronouncements that are applicable or relevant to the Company under the liquidation basis of accounting. Item 3. Quant itative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As of September 30, 2024, we had 601.2 million of unconsolidated mortgage debt reflecting our pro rata share of Worldwide Plaza s total mortgage debt of 1.2 billion. This debt consisted of fixed-rate secured mortgage notes payable. Changes in market interest rates have no impact on interest due on the notes. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Other Matters There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFO RMATION Item 1. Legal P roceedings. Except as set forth below and described in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies of our notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. Except as set forth therein, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are not a party to, and none of our properties are subject to, any material pending legal proceedings. On December 28, 2022, the Company filed suit against WWP JV LLC captioned New York REIT Liquidating LLC v. WWP JV LLC, (Del. Ch.). The Company is seeking declaratory relief that it may release to its unitholders a reserve of more than 90 million (the Reserve which was established in 2017 in connection with a transaction between the Company s subsidiary, ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC, and WWP JV LLC relating to WWP JV LLC's proposed investment in Worldwide Plaza, an office and retail mixed-use project located in midtown Manhattan. On May 11, 2023, the Delaware Court of Chancery stayed the case pending resolution of the New York litigation initiated by the Company's subsidiary, ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC, as described below. The Company s subsidiary, ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC filed suit against WWP JV LLC on December 22, 2022. The suit is captioned ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC v. WWP JV LLC, (Sup. Ct. N.Y. County), and, on February 10, 2023, the Company was named as Counterclaim Defendant and Third-Party Defendant in such action. ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC has sought declaratory relief that it need not fund certain disputed capital contributions exceeding 82 million under the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of WWP Holdings, LLC LLC Agreement related to proposed capital improvements at Worldwide Plaza, because it is ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC's position that the Initial Budget expired at year end 2018 and the subject capital improvements would require a new Annual Budget that has received Board Approval, which has not occurred. WWP JV LLC s counterclaim against the Company seeks declaratory relief that the Company must continue to maintain the Reserve until such time as a member of WWP Holdings, LLC issues a call notice for the Reserve under the LLC Agreement (the Counterclaim ). WWP JV LLC s third party claims against the Company assert claims for fraud, fraudulent inducement, and unjust enrichment and seek damages in excess of 90 million (the Third Party Claims ). The Supreme Court, New York County dismissed the Third Party Claims against the Company on November 14, 2023; WWP JV LLC has appealed that dismissal. It is the Company s and ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC s position that the Counterclaim and Third Party Claims are without merit and fail to state any causes of action upon which relief may be granted as a matter of law and/or pursuant to the express terms of the LLC Agreement. Moreover, NYRT is not a party to the LLC Agreement. If the Company is unsuccessful in receiving favorable declaratory judgments in the above-referenced actions or is unsuccessful in defending the claims against it therein, the Company may be required to contribute additional capital to the joint venture. As stated above, it is the Company's and ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC's position that the Counterclaim and the Third Party Claims are without merit and the Company and ARC NUWWPJV001, LLC vigorously dispute the Counterclaim and the Third Party Claims. The Company cannot predict and expresses no prediction as to the outcome of these matters. Therefore, the Company cannot estimate the range of any reasonably possible loss. Item 1A. Risk F actors. As described in this Form 10-Q, the lease with Cravath expired on August 31, 2024, and the space has not been re-leased. Until such time as the space can be re-leased, net operating income will be materially negatively impacted and operating cash flow at the property will not be sufficient to cover property operations and debt service payments. Interest on the mezzanine debt has not been paid since August 6, 2024. On September 13, 2024, ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC received a copy of a default notice to WWP Mezz, LLC, a subsidiary of WWP Holdings LLC, as borrower under a 190.0 million mezzanine first loan, as a result of failure by the borrower to make a required interest payment of 0.8 million under the loan agreement. The borrower has entered into pre-negotiation agreements with the lenders and has begun discussions on potential loan modifications.
