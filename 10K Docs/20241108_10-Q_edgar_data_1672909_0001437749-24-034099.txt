Effective December 12, 2023, the Indemnity Agreement was amended to increase the maximum indemnification by an additional , bringing the total to a maximum of . 
 
 Effective December 21, 2023, the Company entered into its annual live race meet and purse fund contribution agreement with the Minnesota Horsemen s Benevolent Protective Association MHBPA and the Minnesota Quarter Horse Racing Association ("MQHRA") regarding the upcoming 2024 live race meet. In an effort to increase field size and improve the quality of racing for the 2024 season, the Company has guaranteed purses for overnight races at per race. The parties recognize there is likely to be a significant financial cost to the Company in establishing a 2024 thoroughbred purse structure intended to average per conducted overnight race and that to maintain that average purse structure, the Company will be making an overpayment that may be repaid to the Company through reimbursement in subsequent racing years. This anticipated overpayment of purses by the Company is intended to create a short-term bridge until additional purse supplements can be obtained from other sources. In the event that additional purse revenue is secured within the next five years through additional forms of gaming at the Company, new revenue streams, or legislative action, the Company will be eligible for reimbursement of the actual 2024 overpayment amount from those purse supplements. In addition, the Company agreed to allocate approximately to be used as recruiting and participation incentives to attract thoroughbred trainers, owners, and stables for the 2024 live meet in an effort to generate additional pari-mutuel handle through improved field size. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has recognized expenses of and , respectively, related to these incentives. 
 
 The Company is periodically involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Management believes that the resolution of any pending claims and legal actions at September 30, 2024 and as of the date of this report, will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial positions or results of operations. 
 
 In August 2018, the Company entered into a Contract for Private Redevelopment with the City of Shakopee in connection with a Tax Increment Financing District TIF District ). On January 25, 2022, the Company received the fully executed First Amendment to the Contract for Redevelopment among the Master Developer, the City and the Authority, which is effective as of September 7, 2021. Under this contract, the Company is obligated to construct certain infrastructure improvements within the TIF District, and will be reimbursed for the cost of TIF eligible improvements by the City of Shakopee by future tax increment revenue generated from the developed property, up to specified maximum amounts. The total amount of funding that Canterbury will be paid as reimbursement under the TIF program for these improvements is not guaranteed and will depend on future tax revenues generated from the developed property. 

On September 27, 2018, Canterbury Development LLC contributed approximately acres of land as its equity contribution in the Doran Canterbury I joint venture and became a equity member. On December 20, 2018, financing for Doran Canterbury I was secured. Doran Canterbury I completed Phase I of the Project, which includes 321 units, a heated parking ramp, and a clubhouse. As the Company is able to assert significant influence, but not control, over Doran Canterbury I s operational and financial policies, the Company accounts for the joint venture as an equity method investment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded losses of and , respectively, on equity method investment related to this joint venture. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a loss of and income of , respectively, on equity method investment related to this joint venture. The increased income for the first nine months of 2023 is due to a gain recognized on insurance proceeds received by Doran Canterbury I related to an outstanding claim. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, since we are committed to provide future capital contributions to Doran Canterbury I, we also present as a liability in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets the net balance recorded for our share of Doran Canterbury I's losses in excess of the amount funded into Doran Canterbury I, which was and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements for a summary of member loans to Doran Canterbury I.

Under the contribution and indemnity agreement, as amended, the Company is obligated to reimburse and indemnify each loan guarantor for any amounts paid by such loan guarantor to the lender on debt financing by Doran Canterbury I, up to a maximum of as of September 30, 2024. See Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies. 
 
 Doran Canterbury II, LLC

The Operating Agreement was amended and restated by the members effective July 30, 2020. On September 30, 2020, Canterbury Development LLC contributed approximately acres of land as its equity contribution in the Doran Canterbury II joint venture and became a equity member. Doran Canterbury II has completed developing Phase II of the project which includes an additional 300 apartment units. As the Company is able to assert significant influence, but not control, over Doran Canterbury II s operational and financial policies, the Company accounts for the joint venture as an equity method investment. For the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2024, the Company recorded losses of and , respectively, on equity method investment related to this joint venture. As of September 30 , 2023, the proportionate share of Doran Canterbury II's earnings was immaterial as Doran Canterbury II was not placed into service until January 2024. Under the Operating Agreement, we are required to provide future member loans to Doran Canterbury II to cover the costs of construction or operating deficiencies. See Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements for a summary of member loans to Doran Canterbury II. 
 
 Canterbury DBSV Development, LLC 
 
 On June 16, 2020, Canterbury Development LLC, entered into an Operating Agreement with an affiliate of Greystone Construction, as the two members of a Minnesota limited liability company named Canterbury DBSV Development, LLC ("Canterbury DBSV"). Canterbury DBSV was formed as part of a joint venture between Greystone and Canterbury Development LLC for a multi-use development on the -acre land parcel located on the southwest portion of the Company s racetrack. Canterbury Development LLC's equity contribution to Canterbury DBSV was approximately 13 acres of land, which were contributed to Canterbury DBSV on July 1, 2020. In connection with its contribution, Canterbury Development became a equity member in Canterbury DBSV. As the Company is able to assert significant influence, but not control, over Canterbury DBSV s operational and financial policies, the Company accounts for the joint venture as an equity method investment. Canterbury DBSV has since entered into multiple other joint venture investments, all related to the multi-use development of the 13 -acre parcel mentioned before. All such investments are accounted for under the equity method by Canterbury DBSV. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded losses of and , respectively, on equity method investments related to this joint venture. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded losses of and , respectively, on equity method investments related to this joint venture.

Trackside Investments was formed as a joint venture for the development of an approximately square foot restaurant and entertainment venue. Canterbury Development, LLC's equity contribution to Trackside Investments was approximately acres of land, which were contributed to Trackside Investments on August 20, 2024. In connection with its contribution, Canterbury Development became a equity member in Trackside Investments. In addition, Canterbury Development is guaranteed an annual preferred return on the balance of Canterbury Development's undistributed base capital. As the Company is able to assert significant influence, but not control, over Trackside Investments' operational and financial policies, the Company accounts for the joint venture as an equity method investment. 
 
 In accordance with ASC 610 - 20, we determined that we do not have a controlling financial interest in the Trackside Investments joint venture and the arrangements meet the criteria to be accounted for as a contract. Therefore, we derecognized the land and recognized a full gain (approximately between the carrying amount of the land and the estimated fair value of the land transferred. In future periods, the Company will recognize its proportionate share of Trackside Investments' earnings as an increase or decrease in its Equity investment and as Income or Loss from Investment in this joint venture.

The primary source of Casino revenue is a percentage of the wagers received from players as compensation for providing the Casino facility and services, which is referred to as collection revenue. Other Poker Revenue and Other Table Games Revenue presented above includes fees collected for the administration of tournaments and the poker jackpot and amounts earned as reimbursement of the administrative costs of maintaining table games jackpot funds, respectively. 

As indicated by the table above, total Casino revenue decreased 345,000, or 3.4 , and 542,000, or 1.8 , for the three and nine months ended 
 September 
 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 can be primarily attributed to both a decrease in drop and a lower average collection revenue rate in table games, somewhat offset by an increase in our other table games revenue due to increases related to our progressive jackpot revenue.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in pari-mutuel revenues is primarily due to one fewer live race day (37 race days in 2024 compared to 38 race days in 2023). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in pari-mutuel revenues is primarily due to an increase in live race days year-over-year (54 race days in 2024 compared to 53 race days in 2023 for the nine months ended September 30) as well as increased out-of-state handle due to increased field sizes on a per race basis.

Food and Beverage Revenue: 
 
 Food and beverage revenue decreased 208,000, or 6.3 , and increased 122,000, or 1.8 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to one fewer race day compared to the same period last year. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to increased catering operations related to hosting large scale special events as well the one additional race day year-over-year mentioned above. 
 
 Other Revenue: 
 
 Other revenue increased 647,000, or 27.8 , and increased 1,005,000, or 21.1 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is primarily due to admission revenue increases related to our first ever rodeo, our first comedy series, and our live racing events. 
 
 Operating Expenses: 
 
 Total operating expenses decreased 92,000, or 0.5 , and increased 300,000, or 0.7 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The following paragraphs provide further detail regarding certain operating expenses. 
 
 Purse expense increased 202,000, or 7.8 , and increased 440,000, or 7.3 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is primarily due to the expenses incurred as part of our recruiting and participation incentives paid in 2024 under our annual live race meet and purse fund contribution agreement dated December 21, 2023. See Note 6. for further details. 
 
 Salaries and benefits increased 45,000, or 0.6 , and increased 358,000, or 1.8 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is primarily due to annual wage increases along with the State of Minnesota annual mandated increase in the minimum wage. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 105,000, or 12.6 , and increased 368,000, or 15.9 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is primarily due to placing larger fixed assets into service towards the second half of 2023 as well as placing assets into service related to the first and second phases of our barn relocation and redevelopment plan in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Advertising and marketing costs decreased 219,000, or 24.6 , and decreased 602,000, or 33.1 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to intentionally reducing overall spend in an effort to cut costs. 
 
 Professional and contracted services decreased 369,000, or 16.1 , and decreased 244,000, or 5.0 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to higher costs in 2023 related to long-term strategic growth initiatives. 
 
 Other operating expenses increased 247,000, or 17.7 , and 20,000, or 0.5 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher promoter expenses related to special events. 
 
 During the 2024 third quarter, the Company recorded a gain on transfer of land of 1,732,000 as result of transferring approximately 3.5 acres of land to the Trackside Investments joint venture. See Note 7. for further details. 
 
 Other Income (Loss), Net: 
 
 Other loss, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 853,000, a decrease of 715,000, compared to other loss, net, of 137,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other loss, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,808,000, a decrease of 3,804,000, compared to other income of 1,995,000 for the nine months ended September 30 , 2023. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year is primarily due to our share of insurance proceeds received on a claim by Doran Canterbury I during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was partially offset by increased interest income due to the Company transferring available cash into certificates of deposit and money market funds as well as an increases to the principal balance related to our member loans to Doran Canterbury I and Doran Canterbury II. 
 
 Income Taxes: 
 
 The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of 772,000 and 533,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of 1,364,000 and 3,709,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We record our quarterly provision for income taxes based on our estimated annual effective tax rate for the year. The decrease in our tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in income before taxes from operations. Our effective tax rate was 27.6 and 28.9 for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 31.9 and 28.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of favorable discrete items that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net Income: 
 
 The Company recorded net income of 2,022,000, or 0.40 per basic and diluted share, and 3,358,000, or 0.67 per basic and diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recorded net income of 1,136,000, or 0.23 per basic and diluted share, and 9,199,000, or 1.87 per basic and 1.86 diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

EBITDA 
 
 To supplement our financial statements, we also provide investors with information about our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP measure, which excludes certain items from net income, a GAAP measure. See the table below, which presents reconciliations of these measures to the GAAP equivalent financial measures. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. We also compute Adjusted EBITDA, which reflects additional adjustments to Net Income to eliminate unusual or non-recurring items, as well as items relating to our real estate development operations and we believe the exclusion of these items allows for better comparability of our performance between periods and is useful in allowing greater transparency related to a significant measure used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted EBITDA has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our business, excluding the impact of our real estate segment, and provides a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions relating to our core, non-real estate business. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA excluded stock-based compensation, as well as depreciation and amortization relating to equity investments, interest expense related to equity investments, and a gain on transfer of land. For the three and months ended September 30, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA also excluded a gain on disposal of assets, a gain on insurance proceeds received by the Company's equity investment, and a gain on sale of land. Neither EBITDA nor adjusted EBITDA is a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as an indicator of our operating performance. EBITDA is presented as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that, when considered with measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide a more complete understanding of our operating results before the impact of investing and financing transactions and income taxes, and it is a widely used measure of performance and a basis for valuation of companies in our industry. Moreover, other companies that provide EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA information may calculate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. 
 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, a GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and to adjusted EBITDA (defined above) which are non-GAAP financial measures, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 :

 Contingencies: 
 
 The Company continues to analyze the feasibility of various options related to the development of our underutilized land. The Company may incur substantial costs during the feasibility and predevelopment process, but the Company believes available funds are sufficient to cover the near-term costs. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on liquidity and capital resource requirements. 

17

Liquidity and Capital Resources: 
 
 The Company's primary source of liquidity and capital resources have been and are expected to be cash flow from operations and cash available under our revolving line of credit. The Company has a line of credit and security agreement with a financial institution. The agreement was amended as of February 28, 2021 to extend the maturity date to January 31, 2024 and increase its revolving credit line up to 10,000,000. The line of credit was collateralized by all receivables, inventory, equipment, and general intangibles of the Company, as well as a mortgage on certain real property. The credit agreement contains covenants requiring the Company to maintain certain financial ratios. The general credit and security agreement was further amended as of January 31, 2024 to extend the maturity date to January 31, 2027 and reduce the maximum borrowing under the line of credit to 5,000,000. In connection with the amendment, the financial institution terminated a mortgage to release certain Company real property as collateral and the parties entered into a negative pledge agreement under which the Company agreed not to create any liens or encumbrances on certain Company real property. As of September 30, 2024 , the outstanding balance on the line of credit was 0. The Company did not borrow on the revolving line of credit during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit and security agreement. 
 
 The Company s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balance at September 30, 2024 was 22,427,000 compared to 25,842,000 as of December 31, 2023 . In August 2023, the Company received approval for a three-phase barn relocation and redevelopment plan totaling approximately 15 million over the course of two years. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has completed phases one and two of the project with phase three currently underway, with estimated remaining costs of approximately 5,000,000. In addition, the Company expects to spend the remaining 3,800,000 in tax increment financing over the next six months for the completion of the private redevelopment plan. The Company believes that unrestricted funds available in its cash accounts, amounts available under its revolving line of credit, along with funds generated from operations and potential future land sales, will be sufficient to satisfy its ongoing liquidity and capital resource requirements for regular operations, as well as these planned development expenses for at least the next twelve months. Furthermore, if the Company engages in additional significant real estate development, significant improvements to its facilities, the Racetrack or surrounding grounds, or strategic growth or diversification transactions, additional financing would more than likely be required and the Company may seek this additional financing through joint venture arrangements, through incurring debt, or through an equity financing, or a combination of any of these. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and tax payments or refunds. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9,281,000, primarily as a result of the following: the Company reported net income of 3,358,000, depreciation of 2,676,000, a loss from equity investment of 3,401,000, and stock-based compensation and 401(k) match totaling 1,074,000. This was partially offset by a gain recognized on a transfer of land of 1,732,000. The Company also experienced an increase in payable to horsepersons of 2,143,000, primarily due to the timing of our live racing season. This was offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 1,974,000, primarily due to purse payments made as part of the 2024 live meet and purse fund contribution agreement, and an increase in inventory and prepaid expenses of 1,131,000, primarily due to the prepayment of infrastructure development, f or the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 10,201,000, primarily as a result of the following: the Company reported net income of 9,199,000, depreciation of 2,308,000, deferred income taxes of 776,000, and stock-based compensation and 401(k) match totaling 1,043,000, offset by a gain from equity investment of 562,000 and a gain on land sale of 6,490,000. The Company experienced an increase in cash related to an employee retention credit receivable of 6,103,000, offset by a decrease in amounts payable to horsepersons of 768,000 and an increase in accounts receivable of 1,002,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11,637,000, primarily due to additions to land, buildings, and equipment of 8,080,000 and an increase in TIF eligible improvements of 2,486,000, which are associated with the barn relocation and redevelopment plan. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 2,895,000, primarily due to net proceeds received from the sale of land of 8,337,000, offset by 5,577,000 in additions to land, buildings, and equipment, which were associated with the barn relocation and redevelopment plan. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,058,000, primarily due to cash dividends paid to shareholders and payments for taxes of equity awards. The Company declared a cash dividend of 0.07 per share payable during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1,126,000, primarily due to cash dividends paid to shareholders and payments for taxes of equity awards. The Company declared a cash dividend of 0.07 per share payable each quarter during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates: 
 
 The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. The nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change. 
 
 These accounting estimates are described in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management made no changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. In applying its critical accounting estimates, management reassesses its estimates each reporting period based on available information. Changes in these estimates did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The development and selection of critical accounting estimates, and the related disclosures, have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts - Property Tax Increment Financing "TIF" Receivable 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded a TIF receivable on its Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately 16,969,000, which represents 13,793,000 of principal and 3,176,000 of interest. The TIF receivable requires significant management estimates and judgement pertaining to whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. The TIF receivable was generated in connection with the Contract for Private Redevelopment, in which the City of Shakopee has agreed that a portion of the future tax increment revenue generated from the developed property around the Racetrack will be paid to the Company to reimburse it for expenses in constructing public infrastructure improvements. 
 
 The Company typically performs an annual collectability analysis of the TIF receivable in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential uncollectability exist. The Company utilizes the assistance of a third party to assist with the projected tax increments. The quantitative analysis includes assumptions based on the market values of the completed development projects within Canterbury Commons, which derives the future projected tax increment revenue. The Company uses the analysis to determine if the future tax increment revenue will exceed the Company's development costs on infrastructure improvements. As a result of our analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023, management believes the TIF receivable will be fully collectible and no allowance related to this receivable is necessary. There were no indicators of potential uncollectability for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Redevelopment Agreement: 
 
 As mentioned above in Note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements, on August 10, 2018, the City of Shakopee, the City of Shakopee Economic Development Authority, and the Company entered into a Redevelopment Agreement in connection with a Tax Increment Financing District TIF District that the City had approved in April 2018. Under the Redevelopment Agreement, the Company has agreed to undertake a number of specific infrastructure improvements within the TIF District, including the development of public streets, utilities, sidewalks, and other public infrastructure and the City of Shakopee agreed that a portion of the tax revenue generated from the developed property will be paid to the Company to reimburse it for its expense in constructing these improvements. The Company expects to finance its improvements under the Redevelopment Agreement with funds from its current operating resources and existing credit facility and, potentially, third-party financing sources. 
 
 On January 25, 2022, the Company received the fully executed First Amendment to the Contract for Private Redevelopment among the Company, the City of Shakopee, and the Shakopee EDA, which is effective as of September 7, 2021. Under the First Amendment and as part of the authorized changes regarding the responsibilities of the Company and the City, improvements on Unbridled Avenue will be primarily constructed by the City of Shakopee. As a result, the total estimated cost of TIF eligible improvements to be borne by the Company was reduced by 5,744,000 to an amount not to exceed 17,592,881.

We face significant competition, both directly from other racing and gaming operations and indirectly from other forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

Nationally, the popularity of horse racing has declined. 

A lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customers.

Inclement weather and other conditions may affect our ability to conduct live racing. 

We are subject to changes in the laws that govern our business, including the possibility of an increase in gaming taxes, which would increase our costs, and changes in other laws may adversely affect our ability to compete. 

We are subject to extensive regulation from gaming authorities that could adversely affect us. 

We rely on the efforts of our partner Doran for the development and profitable operation of our Triple Crown Residences at Canterbury Park joint venture. 

We rely on the efforts of our partner Greystone Construction for a new development project. 

We may not be successful in executing our real estate development strategy. 

We are obligated to make improvements in the TIF district and will be reimbursed only to the extent of future tax revenue. 

We face competition from other real estate developers. 

We may be adversely affected by the effects of inflation 

An increase in the minimum wage mandated under Federal or Minnesota law could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. 

Our success may be affected if we are not able to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. 

The payment and amount of future dividends is subject to Board of Director discretion and to various risks and uncertainties. 

Our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security. 

We process, store, and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.

Management Commentary 

 Canterbury s 2024 third quarter results again demonstrated our ability to deliver consistent, solid financial performance . Net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA of 19.3 million and 3.3 million, respectively, were both up slightly compared to the prior year as we continue to execute on initiatives focused on delivering solid contributions from all segments of our operations, said Randy Sampson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Canterbury Park. This focus is reflected in the 28 year-over-year increase in Other revenues in the third quarter as we continue to position our venue as a leading regional destination for events of all sizes and focus on bringing new, exciting entertainment to the property, such as the debut of the Canterbury Park rodeo in July. The strong contributions from these activities offset modest year-over-year declines in Casino, Pari-mutuel and Food Beverage revenue. Our focus on operating more efficiently and prioritizing cash flow generation is reflected in the adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.0 in the quarter which compares to 16.6 for the same period in 2023. 

We continue our work with top-tier partners to transform the excess land around the property into Canterbury Commons, a regional destination for living, playing and working experiences. There are now currently available or under development over 900 residential units, five restaurants and breweries, two music and entertainment venues, 57,000 square-feet of office space, and other distinct amenities that are the core of an entirely new community in the region. Canterbury Commons is already bringing new, 24-hour traffic and energy to the property, and we expect it will create new long-term revenue sources and economics for the Company. 

Canterbury is well-positioned to deliver solid financial results in the near and long-term. We believe the Company s current valuation does not fully reflect our consistent annual cash flow generation, strong balance sheet with nearly 22 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investments and nearly 17 million related to our tax increment financing receivable, as well as our return of capital initiative through our quarterly cash dividend. This is heightened by the significant value in our real estate which we are unlocking through the development of Canterbury Commons. We remain on track to execute on strategies over the balance of this year and beyond that will further create long-term value for our shareholders. 

Canterbury Commons Development Update 

 Swervo continues to make progress on the construction of its state-of-the-art amphitheater which is expected to open in August 2025. The Company s barn relocation and redevelopment plan is nearing completion with three new barns completed and in operation, with the balance of the planned backside improvements on schedule for completion prior to the 2025 live racing season. Canterbury is also nearing completion of the road adjacent to the amphitheater which will unlock the development potential of roughly 25 acres of land in that portion of the site. 

Residential and commercial construction updates related to joint ventures include: 

Phase II of The Doran Group s upscale Triple Crown Residences at Canterbury Park has leased 80 of its available units. 

o 

Repairs continue on Phase I of the Triple Crown Residences and are expected to be fully complete in late 2024 with a certificate of occupancy expected in early 2025. 

74 of the 147 units of senior market rate apartments at The Omry at Canterbury are leased. 

The pizza restaurant and fitness center in the new, 10,000 square-foot commercial building within the Winners Circle development recently opened; the development s BBQ restaurant is expected to open before year-end. 

A land use application for an additional 28,000 square-foot commercial office building within the Winners Circle development was approved by the City Planning Commission and the City Council, and construction has recently begun on the project. The primary user has 57 of the space under lease and discussions are ongoing with other potential tenants. 

In the third quarter of 2024, Canterbury transferred 3.5 acres of trackside land into a new joint venture. The Company s joint venture partner, Trackside Hospitality, LLC, has begun construction of an approximately 16,000 square foot project that will house a new music venue, restaurant and bar in the spring of 2025. 

Residential and commercial construction updates related to prior land sales include: 

Pulte Homes of Minnesota continues development on the 45-unit second phase of its row home and townhome residences. 

Developer and partner selection for the remaining 50 acres of Canterbury Commons, including 25 acres that will become available for development following the completion of the new road noted above, continues. Additional uses could include office, retail, hotel and restaurants. 

Summary of 2024 Third Quarter Operating Results 

 Net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 19.3 million. Compared to the prior-year period, Casino revenue declined 3.4 primarily due to a decrease in table games drop along with a lower average collection rate. Pari-mutuel and Food Beverage revenue declined 2.3 and 6.3 , respectively, primarily due to one fewer live race day year-over-year (37 in 2024 compared to 38 in 2023). These declines were offset by a 27.8 increase in Other revenue primarily driven by higher admissions revenue related to hosting large scale special events, including Canterbury s first ever rodeo in July, as well as a successful comedy series in September. 

Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 declined slightly to 17.4 from 17.5 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year decline primarily reflects lower advertising and marketing expenses and professional and contracted services, due to proactive efforts to lower overall costs, slightly offset by an increase in other operating expenses, primarily due to higher promoter expenses related to special events. 

The Company recorded a 1.7 million gain on the transfer of 3.5 acres of land to a new joint venture during the three months ended September 30, 2024. There were no transfers or sales of land in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

The Company recorded a loss from equity investment of 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a loss from equity investment of 674,000. The losses from equity investments in both periods were primarily related to the Company s share of depreciation, amortization and interest expense from the Doran Canterbury joint ventures. 

The Company recorded income tax expense of 772,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax expense of 533,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded net income of 2.0 million and diluted earnings per share of 0.40 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 1.1 million and 0.23 per share, respectively. 

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 3.3 million and 3.2 million, respectively. 

Summary of 2024 Year-to-Date Operating Results 

 Net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.4 to 49.6 million, compared to 48.9 million for the same period in 2023. The improvement relative to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects increases in Pari-mutuel, Food Beverage and Other revenues of 1.3 , 1.8 and 21.1 , respectively, partially offset by a 1.8 decline in Casino revenue. The increased Pari-mutuel revenues were primarily the result of the Company having one more live race day compared to the same period last year as well as higher out-of-state handle due to increased field sizes on a per race basis. The increase in Food Beverage revenue was also partially due to the one additional live race day while also benefiting from increased catering operations related to hosting large scale special events. Other revenues increased primarily due to admission revenues related to the rodeo, comedy series and live racing events. 

Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 44.8 million, an increase of 300,000, or less than 1.0 , compared to operating expenses of 44.5 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year increase reflects higher depreciation, due to putting into service upgrades to the Company s barns and backside, and higher salaries and benefits expenses, due primarily to annual wage increases, which more than offset lower advertising and marketing and professional and contracted services expenses as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The Company recorded a 1.7 million gain on the transfer of 3.5 acres of land to a new joint venture during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recorded a gain on sale of land of 6.5 million related to the sale of 37 acres to Swervo during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The Company recorded a loss from equity investment of 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gain from equity investment of 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 is related to the Company s share of depreciation, amortization and interest expense from the Doran Canterbury joint ventures, while the net gain for the same period a year ago is related to a gain recognized on insurance proceeds received by Doran Canterbury I related to an outstanding claim. 

The Company recorded income tax expense of 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax expense of 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The Company recorded net income of 3.4 million and diluted earnings per share of 0.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income and diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 9.2 million and 1.86 per share, respectively. 

Adjusted EBITDA was 8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 8.4 million for the same period in 2023. 

Additional Financial Information 

 Further financial information for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, is presented in the accompanying tables at the end of this press release. Additional information will be provided in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about November 8, 2024. 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

 To supplement our financial statements, we also provide investors with information about our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP measure, and which exclude certain items from net income, a GAAP measure. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest income (net of interest expense), income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as well as excluding stock-based compensation (which includes our 401(k) match expense as this match occurs in Company stock), gain on insurance proceeds relating to equity investments, gain on disposal of assets, gain on the transfer or sale of land, depreciation and amortization related to equity investments, and interest expense related to equity investments. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues. Neither EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, or Adjusted EBITDA margin are measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as an indicator of our operating performance. See the table below, which presents reconciliations of these measures to the GAAP equivalent financial measure, which is net income. We have presented EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that, when considered with measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, EBITDA gives investors a more complete understanding of our operating results before the impact of investing and financing transactions and income taxes, and it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it enables investors to understand and assess our core operating results excluding the effect of these items and is useful to investors in allowing greater transparency related to a significant measure used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted EBITDA has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our business and provides a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions. 

About Canterbury Park 

 Canterbury Park Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: CPHC) owns and operates Canterbury Park Racetrack and Casino in Shakopee, Minnesota, the only thoroughbred and quarter horse racing facility in the State. The Company generally offers live racing from May to September. The Casino hosts card games 24 hours a day, seven days a week, dealing both poker and table games. The Company also conducts year-round wagering on simulcast horse racing and hosts a variety of other entertainment and special events at its Shakopee facility. The Company is also pursuing a strategy to enhance shareholder value by the ongoing development of approximately 140 acres of underutilized land surrounding the Racetrack that was originally designated for a project known as Canterbury Commons . The Company is pursuing several mixed-use development opportunities for the remaining underutilized land, directly and through joint ventures.
