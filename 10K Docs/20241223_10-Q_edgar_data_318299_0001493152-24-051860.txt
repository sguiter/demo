 (UNAUDITED) 

Sparta s
response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 quickly took shape with thorough investigations into evolving customer trends
in health and wellness. As a result, we expanded New World Health Brands and developed a new product line of natural dietary supplements.
In August 2020, we launched an online B to C website: www.newworldhealthbrands.com , featuring high-quality nutritional supplements,
including vitamins and minerals, such as, Iodine for children and adults, Boron, copper/Zinc/Selenium, Magnesium, Spermidine, Vitamin
B Complex, Vitamin C and PQQ, with more products to come. All health and wellness offerings are exclusively sourced and manufactured
in the United States and adhere to strict U.S. standards and guidelines to ensure the safety and quality of our products. Sparta s
commitment to high standards and transparency is tantamount to being a trusted brand. 

Sparta s
subsidiary, Sparta Crypto, Inc., www.SpartaCrypto.com, was established in September 2020, and is in the process of completing a proprietary
state-of-the-art platform designed to connect users of widely adopted digital currencies with sellers of various goods and services.
The platform is scheduled to launch in 2023 and the Company can make no assurances that the described plan will reach implementation.
In addition, the Company has completed and tested a cryptocurrency payment gateway called SpartaPayIQ, www.SpartaPayIQ.com , which
is functional and was formally announced on March 3, 2022. 

Agoge
Global USA, Inc. was formed as a subsidiary of Sparta Crypto, Inc. in December 2022 and entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with WeDev
Group to facilitate cross-border transactions between importers and exporters of goods from the U.S. and Brazil. In addition, Agoge Global
USA provides business intermediary services to global importers and exporters of goods and services. These services provided through
our joint venture agreement with WeDev include, but are not limited to, industry introductions, tax and regulatory compliance assistance,
import and export documentation assistance, reselling services in other jurisdictions, and facilitation of cross-border transactions.

Revenues
from mobile app products and New World Health Brands products are generally recognized upon delivery. Revenues from History Reports are
typically recognized upon delivery/download. Prepayments received from customers before delivery (if any) are recognized as deferred
revenue and recognized upon delivery. The Company records deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due before our performance,
including refundable amounts. Revenues from merchant financing is recognized over the life of the contracts. 

This
hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data when available and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining
fair value. Observable inputs may not always be available for some products or in certain market conditions. 

ASC
815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and
account for them as freestanding derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic
characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and
risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is
not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported
in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered
a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument
is deemed conventional, as described. 

and a working capital deficit of .
The Company s cash balance and revenues generated are not currently sufficient and cannot be projected to cover its operating expenses
for the next twelve months from the filing date of this report. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. 

The
Company s existence is dependent upon management s ability to develop profitable operations. Management is devoting substantially
all of its efforts to developing its business and raising capital and there can be no assurance that the Company s efforts will
be successful. No assurance can be given that management s actions will result in profitable operations or the resolution of its
liquidity problems. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

In
order to improve the Company s liquidity, the Company s management is actively pursuing additional equity financing through
discussions with investment bankers and private investors. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its effort
to secure additional equity financing.

Certain

prices are based on the market price of the Company s common stock, at discounts of to market value. 

The
Company s derivative financial instruments are embedded derivatives related to the outstanding short-term Convertible Notes Payable.
These embedded derivatives included certain conversion features indexed to the Company s common stock. The accounting treatment
of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the derivatives and related items at their fair values as of the
inception date of the Convertible Notes Payable and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. In addition, under the provisions
of Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging; Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ASC 815-40 ),
as a result of entering into the Convertible Notes Payable, the Company is required to classify all other non-employee stock options
and warrants as derivative liabilities and mark them to market at each reporting date. Any change in fair value, including modifications
of terms, will be recorded as non-operating, non-cash income, or expense at each reporting date. If the fair value of the derivatives
is higher at the subsequent balance sheet date, the Company will record a non-operating, non-cash charge. If the fair value of the products
is lower at the subsequent balance sheet date, the Company will record non-operating, non-cash income. These Notes are subject to a six-year
Statute of Limitations in which to bring any potential claims.

General
Overview 

Sparta
Commercial Services, Inc. Sparta, we, us, or the Company is a Nevada corporation
with headquarters in New York City, (www.spartacommercial.com) . We are a multi-disciplined parent corporation operating across
three business sectors Financial Services, E-Commerce Mobile Technology, and Health and Wellness, 

Sparta s
roots are in the Powersports consumer finance industry. The Company provided retail installment loans and leases through authorized motorcycle
dealerships in 33 states, with financing lines of credit provided by institutional lenders. The Company also created and maintained a
full underwriting and servicing platform for its portfolio. The Company s consumer loans and leases business was discontinued post
the Lehman Brothers collapse during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2007, the Company introduced a new initiative, Municipal Financing, www.spartamunicipal.com ), which since inception and through the current date has provided financing for over 100 jurisdictions
to date. Sparta s Municipal Finance program is also currently available to all nonprofit organizations, institutions and entities.
All nonprofit organizations which adhere to IRS guidelines, including 501 (c) 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, are eligible. Both public
nonprofits, also known as public charities, supported with publicly collected funds, and private nonprofits, also known as private foundations,
supported by an individual or business entity, qualify for the program. 

Vehicle
History Reports are a staple of Sparta s E-Commerce Technology subsidiary iMobile Solutions, Inc. Whether a vehicle is intended
for business or recreational use, Sparta s Vehicle History Reports are highly regarded for accuracy and completeness and have been
sold across all 50 states and in 62 countries worldwide. They provide a trusted layer of assurance to vehicle buyers and are available
online and at a range of various dealership websites and showrooms. They include Cyclechex (Motorcycle History Reports at www.cyclechex.com ),
RVchex (Recreational Vehicle History Reports at www.rvchex.com ), and Truckchex (Heavy Duty Truck History Reports at www.truckchex.com ).
Consumers, retailers, auction houses, banks and insurance companies alike scrutinize title history reports for the vital information
needed and factored into crucial business decisions regarding the sale, purchase, lease, insuring of or other financial transactions
on these assets.

The
Company s E-Commerce and Mobile Technology subsidiary, iMobile Solutions, Inc., provides mobile technology services, (www.imobileapp.com),
including web and mobile application creation, development and management for a wide range of businesses to help them increase revenue,
build brand recognition, and improve customer engagement. Our ever-broadening business base of mobile applications includes vehicle dealerships
and racetracks, private clubs and country clubs, schools and entertainment venues, restaurants and grocery stores, as well as various
other merchant types. www.imobileapp.com/app-gallery ). The Company also designs, launches, maintains and hosts websites for businesses
incorporating SEO (search engine optimization), social media marketing, and online reviews to improve their presence online. We provide
specific, tailored action plans for our clients websites that include services such as eCommerce, CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
development and integration. This custom software not only helps businesses communicate with customers but can also be inward facing
used for employees to communicate internally. The CRM software can be web based, integrated with a mobile app, or both. We work with
clients to understand their unique needs and incorporate the features and requirements that are most important to them and will facilitate
their business growth and success. Correspondingly, the Company designs and builds custom kitchen ordering software for independent grocery

their kitchen ordering process. Additionally, we offer text messaging services, which supplement business marketing strategies both to
gain and retain brand loyalty among its clients, customers and investors. Our text messaging platform allows our clients to easily manage,
schedule and analyze text message performance. 

Sparta
created its subsidiary, New World Health Brands, Inc., in April 2019, on the heels of the Agriculture Improvement Act (also known as
the Farm Bill), which was signed into law the previous December 20, 2018. Consequently, hemp (CBD) was removed from Schedule 1 of the
Controlled Substances Act. Company management recognized the substantial business opportunity that lay ahead in the rapidly expanding
hemp-CBD (cannabidiol) market in the United States. During 2019-2020, we sourced, developed and tested 5 CBD product categories totalling
31 products. We procured premium, domestic-grade, full-spectrum, broad-spectrum, and THC free hemp, created product packaging and labelling,
and implemented fulfilment to launch an online B to C website in December of 2019. Effective March 31, 2023, management and the Board
of Directors decided it was in the best interest of its shareholders to close its hemp-derived CBD product division based on the uncertainty
of federal legalization that caused confusion and caution among distributors, retailers, and financial services companies in their efforts
to embrace CBD and bring it to market. 

In
response to the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic in early 2020 Sparta quickly undertook a thorough investigation into evolving customer
trends in health and wellness. As a result, we expanded New World Health Brands and developed a new product line of natural dietary supplements.
In August 2020, we launched an online B to C website: www.newworldhealthbrands.com where we sell high-quality dietary supplements,
including vitamins and minerals, such as, Iodine for children and adults, Boron, copper/Zinc/Selenium, , Magnesium, Spermidine, Vitamin
B Complex, Vitamin C and PQQ. We continue to study the market as we consider new products to add to our offerings. To ensure the safety
and quality of our products, all health and wellness offerings are exclusively sourced and manufactured in the United States and adhere
to strict U.S standards and guidelines. Sparta s commitment to high standards and transparency are tantamount to being a trusted
brand. 

In
September 2020 the Company established Sparta Crypto, Inc., www.SpartaCrypto.com, which spawned both SpartaPayIQ, www.SpartaPayIQ.com,
and Agoge Global, USA, www.AgogeGlobalUSA.com, Agoge which was formed in December 2022. Sparta Crypto is in the process
of completing a proprietary state-of-the-art platform designed to connect users of widely adopted digital currencies with sellers of
high-end goods and services. While the Company expects the platform to launch in early 2025, it can make no assurances that the described
plan will reach implementation at that time. SpartaPayIQ was created as the cryptocurrency transactional engine payment gateway behind
Sparta Crypto and Agoge. After undergoing extensive testing, the Company formally announced it had achieved the optimum functionality
for launch on March 3, 2022. 

Agoge
entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with WeDev Group Ltda. and launched its new integrated Blockchain-based platform, EZBroker 360,
that significantly improves and simplifies the ability of business to conduct international trade in the Brazilian market. The platform
utilizes stablecoins and blockchain technology to decrease costs and improve the speed of these international transactions. Among Agoge s
suite of services is the offering of staged financing for freightage and taxation. Other services include industry introductions, Brazilian
tax and regulatory compliance guidance, import and export documentation assistance, as well as reselling services in other jurisdictions
and facilitation of cross-border transactions. After a significant investment of time and resources, the Agoge platform is now live and
processing transactions for both U.S. and Brazilian corporations.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Comparison
of the three Months Ended October 31, 2024, and 2023 

For
the three months ended October 31, 2024, and 2023, we have generated limited sales revenues, incurred significant expenses, and sustained
substantial operating losses. 

Revenues 

Revenues
totaled 89,359 during the six months ending October 31, 2024, compared to 114,697 during the six months ending October 31, 2023. Revenues
from information technology were down by 36,032 or 37 . This decrease was due primarily to a reduction in mobile application fees. Sales
of New World Health Products were down by 5,444 or 6 , offset by an increase of 16,138 in merchant financing revenues. 

Cost
of Revenue 

The
revenue consists of costs and fees paid to third parties to construct and maintain mobile apps and payments for subscription services
related to vehicle history reports and the cost of goods purchased for New World Health Brand products. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses were 748,812 during the six months ended October 31, 2024, compared to 619,883 during the six months ended October 31, 2023,
an increase of 128,929 or 21 . Expenses incurred during the current three months period consisted primarily of the following expenses:

Other
(income) expense 

During
the six months ended October 31, 2024, other expense of 709,626 is comprised primarily of financing costs of 452,910 and a loss of
the change in valuation of derivative liabilities of 278,704, offset by other commission income of 9,993. During the six months ended
October 31, 2023, other income of 42,808 consisted of gains on the write off of convertible notes of 60,789, a gain on the change in
fair value of our derivative liabilities of 173,373 and other commission income of 3,897, offset by financing costs of 284,867. 

Net
income (loss) 

Our
net loss attributable to common stockholders for the six months ended October 31, 2024, was 1,380,705 compared to a net loss of 575,734
for the six months ended October 31, 2023, primarily due to the change in valuation of derivative liabilities for this period as compared
to three months ending October 31, 2023. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

As
of October 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 68,176,055. The net cash flow used by operations was 1,000,863 for the six months
ending October 31, 2024. This deficit results primarily from our net loss of 1,382,316 and increases in loans receivable related to Agoge
Global USA, Inc. of 523,766, offset by non-cash expenses of 646,552 increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 258,183. 

We
met our cash requirements during the period through proceeds from the issuance of stock for a total of 547,500 and proceeds from notes
payable of 400,000. 

We
anticipate minimal research and development expenditures or expect the sale or acquisition of any significant property, plant, or equipment
during the next twelve months. On October 31, 2024, we had four full-time employees and three part-time employees. If we fully implement
our business plan, our employment base may increase during the next twelve months. As we continue to expand, we will incur additional
costs for personnel. This potential increase in personnel is dependent upon our generating increased revenues and obtaining sources of
financing. We are still determining if we will successfully raise the necessary funds or generate revenues sufficient to fund the potential
increase in the number of employees. A union does not represent our employees. 

While
we have raised capital to meet our working capital and financing needs in the past, additional financing is required to meet our current
and potential future cash flow deficits from operations. 

We
continue to seek additional financing, whether in the form of senior debt, subordinated debt, or equity. We currently have no commitments
for financing that are not at the investor s election. There is no guarantee that we will successfully raise funds required to
support our operations. 

We
will need approximately 1,000,000 in addition to our normal operating cash flow to conduct operations during the next twelve months.
However, there can be no assurance that additional private or public financing, including debt or equity financing, will be available
as needed or, if available, on terms favorable to us. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders. Such additional
equity securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges that are senior to those of our existing common or preferred stock. Furthermore,
if available, debt financing will require the payment of interest. However, it may involve restrictive covenants limiting our operating
flexibility if we cannot generate sufficient liquidity from operations or raise enough capital resources on acceptable terms. In that
case, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. We must adjust
our planned operations and development on a more limited scale. 

The
effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant. Our operations are located in North America, and no seasonal
aspects would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

19 

GOING
CONCERN ISSUES 

The
Company s historical losses and the lack of revenues raise substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. We cannot assure that our business operations will develop and provide us with significant cash to continue operations.
If we cannot build our business, we have to discontinue operations or cease to exist, which would be detrimental to the value of the
Company s common stock. 

To
improve the Company s liquidity, the Company s management is actively pursuing additional financing through discussions with
investment bankers, financial institutions, and private investors. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its
effort to secure additional financing. 

We
continue to experience net operating losses. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to develop profitable
operations. We are devoting all our efforts to growing our business and raising capital. Our net operating losses increase the difficulty
in meeting such goals, and there can be no assurance that such methods will prove successful. 

The
primary issues management will focus on in the immediate future include: seeking additional credit facilities from institutional lenders,
institutional investors for debt or equity investments in our Company, short-term interim debt financing: and private placements of debt
and equity securities with accredited investors. 

To
address these issues, we have engaged a financial advisory firm to advise and assist us in negotiating and raising capital. 

INFLATION 

The
impact of inflation on the costs of the Company and the ability to pass on cost increases to its customers over time is dependent upon
market conditions. The Company is not aware of any inflationary pressures that have had any significant impact on the Company s
operations over the past quarter, and the Company does not anticipate that inflationary factors will have a substantial effect on future
operations. 

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

The
Company does not maintain off-balance sheet arrangements or participate in non-exchange traded contracts requiring fair value accounting
treatment. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The
preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Future events, however, may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions. While several significant
accounting policies affect our financial statements, the following critical accounting policy involves the most complex, difficult, and
subjective estimates and judgments. 

Revenue
Recognition 

During
the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the cumulative-effect
method. The new standard requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The adoption did
not impact our consolidated financial statements other than the enhancement of our disclosures related to our revenue-generating activities. 

20 

The
Company acts as a principal in its revenue transactions as it is the primary obligor. 

Revenues
from mobile app products and New World Health Brands products are generally recognized upon delivery. Revenues from History Reports are
generally recognized upon delivery/download. Prepayments received from customers before delivery (if any) are recognized as deferred
revenue and recognized upon delivery. The Company records deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due before our performance,
including refundable amounts. 

Information
Technology: 

The
Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria have been met: 

Persuasive
 evidence of an arrangement exists. 

No
 significant Company obligations remain. 

Collection
 of the related receivable is reasonably assured. 

The
 fees are fixed or determinable. 

The
Company acts as a principal in its revenue transactions as it is the primary obligor. 

Revenues
from mobile app products are generally recognized upon delivery. Revenues from History Reports are generally recognized upon delivery/download.
Prepayments received from customers before delivery (if any) are recognized as deferred revenue and recognized upon delivery. 

New
World Health Brands: 

Revenues
from New World Health Brands products are generally recognized upon delivery. 

Merchant
Financing: 

Revenues
from merchant financing is recognized over the life of the contracts. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification Topic 718 ASC 718-10 ), which
records compensation expense on a straight-line basis, generally over the explicit service period of three to five years. 

ASC
718-10 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the grant date using an option-pricing model. The
value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in
the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company is using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as its method of
valuation for share-based awards. The Company s determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant
using an option-pricing model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding several highly complex
and subjective variables. These variables include but are not limited to the Company s expected stock price volatility over the
awards term and other market variables, such as the risk-free interest rate. 

Inventories 

Inventory
comprises finished goods for the Company s New World Health Brands business. The Company s inventories represent finished
goods, consisting of products available for sale. They are accounted for using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method and valued at the
lower cost or net realizable value. 

Convertible
Instruments 

The
Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with professional standards
for Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ASC 815-40 ). 

21 

ASC
815-40 provides that, among other things, generally, if an event is not within the entity s control and could or require net cash
settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability. The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when
it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in accordance with professional
standards when Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features , as those professional
standards pertain to Certain Convertible Instruments . Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts
to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based on the differences between the
fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded
in the note. The Company also records, when necessary, deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred
shares based upon the differences between the underlying common stock s fair value at the note transaction s commitment date
and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related
debt to their earliest redemption date. 

Derivative
Liabilities 

ASC
815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and
account for them as freestanding derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic
characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and
risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is
not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported
in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered
a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument
is deemed conventional, as described.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024. Based
on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls,
the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.

Management
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer,
we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, using the criteria established
in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on
a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
that is less severe than a material weakness yet necessary enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the Company s
financial reporting. In our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, we determined
that control deficiencies existed that constituted material weaknesses, as described below: 

lack of documented policies and procedures; 

we have no audit committee; 

there is a risk of management override, given that our officers have a high degree of involvement in our day-to-day operations; 

there is no effective separation of duties, which includes monitoring controls, between the members of management. 

Due
to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. As a result,
we have been unable to improve our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ending October 31, 2024. However, to
the extent possible, we will implement procedures to ensure that the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets, and the recording
of transactions will be performed by separate individuals. Management is currently evaluating the steps to address these material weaknesses. 

Accordingly,
these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by our internal controls. 

As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

In
light of these significant deficiencies, we performed additional analyses and procedures to conclude that our consolidated financial
statements for the quarter ended October 31, 2024, included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, were fairly stated in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our significant deficiency, our consolidated financial statements for the three
months ended October 31, 2024, are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit a smaller reporting company to provide only management s
report in its annual report. 

Statement
of Auditing Standards No. 100, Interim Financial Information SAS100 requires a registrant to engage an independent accountant
to review the registrant s interim financial information. The financial statements included in this filing has not been subject
to a review by its independent public accountant
