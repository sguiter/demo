The fair value accounting standards define fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is determined based upon assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurements are rated on a three-tier hierarchy as follows: 

Level 1 inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 

Level 2 inputs: Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3 inputs: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 during three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Overview 
 
 APPlife Digital Solutions, Inc. (the Company was formed March 5, 2018, in Nevada and has offices in San Francisco, California and Shanghai, China. Our office in San Francisco, California allows us to take advantage of the marketing opportunities available in the United States as well as keeping close proximity to sources of capital whether it is debt or equity. Our offices in Shanghai, China allows us to take advantage of a high concentration of skilled tech coders and developers at lower capital costs than in more developed countries such as the United States or Europe. The Company s mission is using digital technology to create and invest in eCommerce and Cloud based businesses that make life, business and living easier, more efficient, and just smarter. 
 
 Plan of Operation 
 
 Our marketing and business management/executive team will operate from both Shanghai China and our offices in San Francisco. Matt Reid is technically the only employee of the Company, and he resides in Shanghai, China, in order to manage the independent contractor teams of developers the Company hires. We have an attorney in Shanghai engaged to help us with the contracts and negotiations with developers and other similar items. We have multiple independent contractor team members for the Company that live and work in the US who make up our business management and executive teams. They do not operate in China, and we generate no revenue in China. Our independent contractors fill positions such as Chief Legal Officer, Executive Project Director, Accountant and Investor relations manager and are all located in New York. Our Director of Marketing, PR agent and multiple lower-level independent contractors reside and work in California. None of the operating business models we have are generating any revenue from Chinese based businesses. Currently 100 of our revenue comes from an ecommerce platform servicing US customers and there are no current plans to buy or develop any new Chinese based business models. 
 
 We will continue to explore new concepts and opportunities to invest in projects that meet our criteria We have incurred expenses and operating losses, as part of our activities in developing e-commerce platforms, B2BCHX, OFFICEHOP, ROOSTER ESSENTIALS, Valida and Global Hemp Service LLC. The capital we raise will go into marketing, acquisitions, and revenue generation. We believe this will take our vision forward and to the next level. 
 
 The APPlife Digital Solutions business model is two-fold. First, is to market our current in-house developed projects ecommerce and cloud-based business over the next year, work to add partnerships and add additional in-house developed projects. We plan to engage multiple resources such as adding staff, create partnerships, and as capital becomes available, to market and grow revenue. 
 
 The second, but equally important part of our business model is to target acquisitions and projects that can be assisted by our marketing and capitalization capabilities where we can play an active role in the project s success and make the acquisitions to add to our revenue stream. We seek acquisition targets that have a model that fits our vision and area of interest, is currently generating revenue with room for growth and a strong management team that will stay on board and continue to operate the entity post-acquisition. We have signed an asset purchase agreement to buy the assets around the operations of an online beauty company with revenue. 
 15 

Our current projects: 
 
 B2BCHX is our first fully developed app that is available in Google Play and a functioning ecommerce and mobile website. B2BCHX allows business owners around the world to order three levels of background checks in English on Chinese companies to prevent fraudulent business transactions, to gather information in order to gain confidence when doing business with a Chinese entity or to pursue legal remedy against fraudulent Chinese Company. The reports are researched and written by a licensed law firm in Shanghai China in a partnership agreement with B2BCHX. These reports are not auto generated and are carefully researched to give our users the most accurate information. The retail price for each report is 79, 399 and 1299. The partnership with the law firm is on a 20 revenue share, which leaves B2BCHX an 80 per report profit margin to cover development expenses, maintenance and profit. We are waiting for a temporary law change that will allow the attorney to send information on Chinese entities overseas. 
 
 ROOSTER ESSENTIALS ecommerce website, has been operations in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and launched its full commercial operations in the second quarter of 2022. ROOSTER ESSENTIALS is an online men s grooming supply store, and it allows men to fully customize which products they receive and set up an auto-delivery schedule for each product for automatic recurring delivery. ROOSTER ESSENTIALS currently carries over 200 products from over 80 brands. We anticipate the sources of revenue will come from purchases, advertising and sponsorships. 
 
 OFFICE HOP entered beta testing in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is now fully functional. We believe OFFICE HOP fits perfectly into the needs of the post Covid working world, where short-term offices and meeting rooms will be in high demand. The OFFICE HOP model is like Airbnb for short term shared or private office space and meeting rooms. Those offices that have an extra office, shared desk, an empty meeting room or conference room may list the space and act as a host for a user. Those users in need of a short-term shared desk, meeting room or private office may locate one on our platform and rent it out for use as needed by the hour, half day, full day, week or month. We will also offer access to creative spaces such as photo studios and pop-up art galleries and will offer restaurants with private rooms a way to rent out the space with a menu included for group or lunch meetings. The revenue is expected to come from the 10-15 service fee charged to Users for finding and making a transaction with one of our listed properties. The platform is global. We will begin operations in North America and Europe and then eventually operate in South America and Asia. 
 
 Global Hemp Services LLC is a low risk and low-cost participation in the fast growing Hemp and CBD market space. We have licensed out our fully functional ecommerce platform in exchange for a 15 equity position and 2.5 revenue share, with exclusive rights to purchase an additional 36 of the equity (for a total of 51 upon reaching revenue benchmarks. Global Hemp Service LLC distributes Hemp and CBD products globally, including Hemp based building materials, textiles, plastics, paper, personal care items and various CBD products. They will distribute wholesale to shops and stores and retail directly to consumers. 
 
 Lollipop NFT will have a new name and will now be known as Valida. We have changed the model initially presented for Lollipop. Formerly an online marketplace, consignment store, creator platform, and wallet, it is now intended to be what we call a super wallet. It is non-custodial and will be able to be connected through API directly to various marketplaces of the user s choice. We will focus on storing and sharing of NFTs that represent practical use. For example, we will focus on Driver s licenses, Diplomas, Real Estate escrow documents and title. The storage and ability to reference these valuable NFT documents as well as collections of NFT for storage will be available as the core model. The wallet will be a digital wallet, with cold storage for security. Once completed the system code will be audited by a third-party auditor and there will be multiple security daemons to monitor account login and asset transfers to protect the user. We have completed the design and preliminary development phase of this project, but have not yet begun writing the code. We plan to use the Polygon blockchain to create the wallet and have also lined up tech support with Polygon. We anticipate having a cold wallet system that allows the users to transfer between storage and active modes and plan to include 2FA, fingerprint and/or facial recognition technology. We plan to have multiple additional security daemons that review account holdings and prevent unauthorized transfers and withdrawals, however we may be liable for any cybersecurity breach resulting in the loss of customer assets. We plan to have multiple additional security daemons that review account holdings and prevent unauthorized transfers and withdrawals. The main focus of our user base will be practical use NFTs. We believe this is the future best use scenario for NFTs. This is what we believe will set us apart from those systems designed to buy and sell digital art and items that may be considered securities. We expect users to store their important documents and certifications in files. An example is we will allow universities to bulk upload diplomas into the system that will be an image of the 
 16 
 
 certificate with the graduate s name in place. The Meta Data will show in a border area that discloses the name of the University, the degree, date of issue and an official University stamp. The User will have the option of receiving the NFT version by registering and then using a code provided by the school to download the diploma NFT into the wallet. This would also apply to Driver s licenses issued by State DMVs, Real Estate Broker licenses, Wills and other important legal documents, Escrow or Title paperwork. We are not intending on blocking people from storing other types of NFTs, but our format and storage UI is not appealing to those collecting digital art. Our interface will resemble a windows filing system. It is tailored to cater to file storage for the practical use type. 
 
 Our DRINX project is in early stage of development and we believe the beta version will be ready by the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. DRINX app allows anyone to purchase a virtual drink ticket anywhere and at any time for friends and colleagues. We anticipate the sources of revenue will come from advertising and sponsorships from alcohol companies promoting products on the app, user fee of 0.99 to send each drink and discounts provided by the bars and restaurants for purchases made by the app. 
 
 Results of Operations for Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenue 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated revenue of 968 and 3,854, respectively. The Company has been in the process of marketing and developing its apps, hiring developers and coders, incurring professional fees for registering its common stock and identifying other apps and partnerships to generate revenues as the Company expands its operations. 
 
 The decrease was primarily due to successful marketing efforts in 2023 that decreased in 2024. 
 
 Operating Loss 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we had operating losses of 184,424 and 585,705, respectively. This decrease was due primarily to less stock compensation in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had other income (expense) of (11,066) and (86,157), respectively. The other income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due to interest expense of 155,761 and change in fair value of derivative liabilities of 144,695. The other expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due to the interest expense of 138,798, partially offset by the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of 52,641. 
 
 Net loss 
 
 We reported a net loss of 184,424 and 671,466 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

We anticipate generating losses and, therefore, may be unable to continue operations in the future. If we require additional capital, we will have to issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party. The current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 amounting to 2,363,549 and 2,254,187, respectively, include 583,656 and 728,351 of derivative liabilities which relate to the convertible notes payable and stock options. Upon exercise of the stock options and settlement of notes payable, the derivative liability will be reclassified as equity. 
 17 
 
 Going Concern 
 As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has minimal revenue generating operations and has an accumulated deficit of 22,060,309 and 21,925,000 as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively . In addition, the Company has experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The Company anticipates additional equity financing to fund operations in the future. Should management fail to adequately address the issue, the Company may have to reduce its business activities or curtail its operations.

Our cash balance was 54,174 as of September 30, 2024. We recorded a net loss of 184,424 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We expect our expenses will continue to increase during the foreseeable future as a result of increased operations and the development of our apps and business operations. We anticipate generating revenues with our B2BCHX app, but only minimal revenues for our other apps over the next twelve months. Consequently, we are dependent on the proceeds from future debt or equity investments to sustain our operations and implement our business plan. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be required to delay or forego some portion of our business plan, which would have a material adverse effect on our anticipated results from operations and consolidated financial condition. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary amounts of capital or that our estimates of our capital requirements will prove to be accurate. 
 
 We presently do not have any significant credit available, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity. Due to our operating losses, our operations have not been a source of liquidity. We will need to obtain additional capital in order to expand operations and become profitable. In order to obtain capital, we may need to sell additional shares of our common stock or borrow funds from private lenders. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding. 
 
 To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to existing stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek to compensate providers of services by issuance of stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to existing stockholders. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. 
 
 No assurance can be given that sources of financing will be available to us and/or that demand for our equity/debt instruments will be sufficient to meet our capital needs, or that financing will be available on terms favorable to us. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may not be able to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or may be required to reduce the scope of our planned marketing efforts and development of our apps, any of which could have a negative impact on our business and operating results. In addition, insufficient funding may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, which could require us to: 
 
 Curtail the development of our apps, 
 Seek strategic partnerships that may force us to relinquish significant rights to our apps, or 
 Explore potential mergers or sales of significant assets of our Company.

Operating Activities 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company used 70,720 and 102,690 in cash to fund our operating activities, respectively. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the cash used in operating activities was the result of net loss during the period partially offset by stock compensation expense, amortization of debt discount, interest expense, offset by change in fair value of derivative liabilities. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the cash used in operating activities was the result of net loss during the period and gain from change in fair value of derivative liabilities, partially offset by amortization of debt discount, interest expense, issuances of common stock for services, stock compensation expense and an increase in working capital accounts. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the company did not have any investing activities. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 102,000 and 80,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 107,000 of proceeds from the issuance of notes payable to stockholders and paid a 5,000 payments of the balance amounts of due to officer. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received 80,000 of proceeds from the issuance of notes payable to shareholders. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and the Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company s financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. 
 
 Management believes the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company s management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company will recognize revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. 
 19 

Stock Based Compensation 
 
 The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provision of FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC 718 ), prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on the estimated grant date fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). 
 
 The Company accounts for share-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 505, Equity based Payments to Non-Employees ASC 505 ). Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date. 
 
 Derivative Liability 
 
 FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , requires all derivatives to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. As of September 30, 2024, we used the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model to estimate the fair value of the conversion feature of the convertible note. Key assumptions of the BSM model include the market price of our stock, the conversion price of the debt, applicable volatility rates, risk-free interest rates and the instrument s remaining term. These assumptions require significant management judgment. In addition, changes in any of these variables during a period can result in material changes in the fair value (and resultant gains or losses) of this derivative instrument. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 
 We are an emerging growth company under the federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 We do not expect our sales to be impacted by seasonal demands for our products and services. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses resulting from the Board of Directors not currently having any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management has also evaluated our internal control over financial reporting, and there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of our last evaluation. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 
 We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which our director, officer or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.
