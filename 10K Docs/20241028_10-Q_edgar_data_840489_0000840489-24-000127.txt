CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS 
 
 Forward-Looking Information 
 
 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements about the business, financial condition, outlook and prospects of FirstCash Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (together, the Company ). Forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as believes, projects, expects, may, estimates, should, plans, targets, intends, could, would, anticipates, potential, confident, optimistic or the negative thereof, or other variations thereon, or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy, objectives, estimates, guidance, expectations, outlook and future plans. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the fact these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. 
 
 While the Company believes the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurances such expectations will prove to be accurate. Security holders are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Certain factors may cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements made in this quarterly report. Such factors may include, without limitation, risks related to the extensive regulatory environment in which the Company operates; risks associated with the legal and regulatory proceedings that the Company is a party to or may become a party to in the future, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB lawsuit filed against the Company; risks related to the Company s acquisitions, including the failure of the Company s acquisitions to deliver the estimated value and benefits expected by the Company and the ability of the Company to continue to identify and consummate acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all; potential changes in consumer behavior and shopping patterns which could impact demand for the Company s pawn loan, retail, lease-to-own LTO and retail finance products; labor shortages and increased labor costs; a deterioration in the economic conditions in the United States and Latin America, including as a result of inflation, elevated interest rates and higher gas prices, which potentially could have an impact on discretionary consumer spending and demand for the Company s products; currency fluctuations, primarily involving the Mexican peso; competition the Company faces from other retailers and providers of retail payment solutions; the ability of the Company to successfully execute on its business strategies; contraction in sales activity at merchant partners of the Company s retail POS payment solutions business; impact of store closures, financial difficulties or even bankruptcies at the merchant partners of the Company s retail POS payment solutions business; and other risks discussed and described in the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including the risks described in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors thereof, and other reports filed with the SEC. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, nor can the Company predict, in many cases, all of the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report speak only as of the date of this quarterly report, and the Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to report any updates or revisions to any such statement to reflect any change in the Company s expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law.

 pawn stores in the U.S. in separate transactions and acquired pawn license that was used to open new pawn store in the state of Nevada. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions totaled million, net of cash acquired and subject to future post-closing adjustments. The aggregate purchase price was composed of million in cash, million in stock consideration and remaining short-term amounts payable to certain of the sellers of approximately million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company also paid million of purchase price amounts payable related to prior-year pawn acquisitions. 
 
 The purchase price of each of the 2024 acquisitions was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. The goodwill arising from these acquisitions consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Company and the pawn stores acquired. These acquisitions were not material individually or in the aggregate to the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 with one or more options to renew for an additional three to , typically at the Company s sole discretion. In addition, the majority of these leases can be terminated early upon an adverse change in law which negatively affects the store s profitability. The Company regularly evaluates renewal and termination options to determine if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the option, and excludes these options from the lease term included in the recognition of the operating lease right of use asset and lease liability until such certainty exists. The weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was years as of September 30, 2024 and years as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 The operating lease right of use asset and lease liability is recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, and therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. The Company utilizes a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate to apply to groups of leases with similar characteristics. The weighted-average discount rate used to measure the lease liability as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
 
 The Company did not have any financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis 
 
 The Company measures non-financial assets and liabilities, such as property and equipment and intangible assets, at fair value on a non-recurring basis, or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may be impaired. There were no such events or conditions identified during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 As cash and cash equivalents have maturities of less than three months, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value. Due to their short-term maturities, the carrying value of pawn loans and accounts receivable, net approximate fair value. 
 
 Finance receivables are measured at amortized cost, net of an allowance for loan losses on the consolidated balance sheets. In estimating fair value for finance receivables, the Company utilized a discounted cash flow methodology. The Company used various unobservable inputs reflecting its own assumptions, such as contractual future principal and interest cash flows, future charge-off rates and discount rates (which consider current interest rates and are adjusted for credit risk, among other factors). 
 
 The carrying value of the unsecured credit facilities approximates fair value as of September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023. The fair value of the unsecured credit facilities is estimated based on market values for debt issuances with similar characteristics or rates currently available for debt with similar terms. In addition, the unsecured credit facilities have a variable interest rate based on the prevailing secured overnight financing rate SOFR or the Mexican Central Bank s interbank equilibrium rate TIIE and reprice with any changes in SOFR or TIIE. The fair value of the senior unsecured notes is estimated based on quoted prices in markets that are not active.

 Revolving Unsecured Credit Facility 
 
 During the period from January 1, 2024 through August 8, 2024, the Company maintained an unsecured line of credit with a group of U.S.-based commercial lenders (the Credit Facility in the amount of million, which was scheduled to mature on August 30, 2027. The Credit Facility charged interest, at the Company s option, of either (i) the prevailing SOFR (with interest periods of 1, 3 or 6 months at the Company s option) plus a fixed spread of and a fixed SOFR adjustment of or (ii) the prevailing prime or base rate plus a fixed spread of . 
 
 On August 8, 2024, the Credit Facility was amended (the 2024 Amendment in order to increase the total lender commitment, extend the term of the Credit Facility, amend certain financial covenants and modify the benchmark interest rate. Under the 2024 Amendment, the total lender commitment was increased from million to million and the term of the Credit Facility was extended to August 8, 2029. In addition, the permitted consolidated leverage ratio was increased to times adjusted EBITDA for the full term of the agreement, while the other financial covenants remain substantially unchanged.

The weighted-average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 was based on 1-month SOFR. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain financial covenants. The Credit Facility also contains customary restrictions on the Company s ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make investments, consummate acquisitions and similar negative covenants with customary carve-outs and baskets. The Company was in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made net payments of million pursuant to the Credit Facility. 
 
 Revolving Unsecured Uncommitted Credit Facility

 Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2028 
 
 On August 26, 2020, the Company issued million of senior unsecured notes due on September 1, 2028 (the 2028 Notes ), all of which are currently outstanding. Interest on the 2028 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1. The 2028 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis jointly and severally by all of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee its Credit Facility. The 2028 Notes will permit the Company to make restricted payments, such as purchasing shares of its stock and paying cash dividends, in an unlimited amount if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any indebtedness to make such payment, the Company's consolidated total debt ratio is less than to 1. The consolidated total debt ratio is defined generally in the indenture governing the 2028 Notes as the ratio of (i) the total consolidated debt of the Company minus cash and cash equivalents of the Company to (ii) the Company s consolidated trailing twelve months EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and giving pro forma effect to operations acquired during the measurement period. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s consolidated total debt ratio was to 1.

 Retail Merchandise Sales Operations 
 
 U.S. retail merchandise sales increased 15 , totaling 235.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 203.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. Same-store retail sales increased 7 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in total retail sales was due to incremental sales contributions from acquired stores and the same-store sales increase. The gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales in the U.S. was 43 for both comparative periods, reflecting continued demand for value-priced, pre-owned merchandise and low levels of aged inventory. 
 
 U.S. inventories increased 10 from 217.4 million at September 30, 2023 to 238.7 million at September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to incremental inventories from acquired stores and an increase in same-store inventories as a result of the higher pawn loan balances noted below. Inventories aged greater than one year in the U.S. were 2 at September 30, 2024 compared to 1 at September 30, 2023.

 Latin America pawn loan fees decreased 4 (6 increase on a constant currency basis), totaling 58.2 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 60.5 million for the third quarter of 2023.

 Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income 
 
 The segment pre-tax operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was 38.5 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 19 compared to 41.0 million and 20 in the prior year, respectively.

LTO Operations 
 
 Leased merchandise, before allowance for lease losses, decreased 7 as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreased gross transaction volumes originated by retail furniture merchant partners. 
 
 The allowance for lease losses decreased 11 to 93.8 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 105.5 million as of September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to the decrease in leased merchandise. As a percentage of lease merchandise, the allowance was 40 at September 30, 2024 and 42 at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Leased merchandise income decreased slightly to 188.6 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 189.4 million during the third quarter of 2023, which was primarily due to lower average leased merchandise balances outstanding during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Depreciation of leased merchandise increased 1 to 105.3 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 104.2 million during the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of leased merchandise income, depreciation of leased merchandise increased slightly from 55 during the third quarter of 2023 to 56 during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Provision for lease losses decreased 1 to 39.3 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 39.6 million during the third quarter of 2023, which was primarily due to the 3 decrease in gross transaction volumes. As a percentage of gross transaction volume, the provision for lease losses was consistent at 27 during both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Retail Finance Operations 
 
 Finance receivables, before allowance for loan losses, increased 11 as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased gross transaction volumes in certain non-furniture industry verticals. 
 
 The allowance for loan losses increased 13 to 109.2 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 96.7 million as of September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to the increase in finance receivables. As a percentage of finance receivables, the allowance was 47 at September 30, 2024 compared to 46 at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest and fees on finance receivables decreased slightly to 61.2 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 61.4 million during the third quarter of 2023, which was primarily due to a slight decline in portfolio yield primarily as a result of AFF expanding its offerings and merchant relationships in certain services sector verticals in the third quarter of 2024, some of which provide slightly lower interest rates. 
 
 Provision for loan losses increased 23 to 40.6 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 33.1 million during the third quarter of 2023, which was primarily due to the 39 increase in gross transaction volume, partially offset by a reduction in the net provisioning rates used during the third quarter of 2024 based on lower than expected loss rates on older vintages. As a percentage of gross transaction volume, the provision for loan losses decreased from 32 during the third quarter of 2023 to 28 during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Segment Expenses

 Corporate Expenses and Taxes 
 
 Administrative expenses decreased 9 to 40.9 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 45.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to decreased management incentive compensation expense and an 11 change in the average value of the Mexican peso resulting in lower U.S. dollar translated administrative expenses in Latin America, partially offset by the increase in the pawn store count. As a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses were 5 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 6 during the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 11 to 13.2 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 14.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a 1.7 million decrease in amortization of acquired AFF intangible assets. 
 
 Interest expense increased 11 to 27.4 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 24.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher floating interest rates on the Company s unsecured bank credit facilities and slightly higher average outstanding debt balances. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Merger and acquisition expenses decreased 93 to 0.2 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, due to timing of acquisition activity. 
 
 Consolidated effective income tax rates for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 23.9 and 26.4 , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in U.S.-sourced income as a result of the U.S. store acquisition activity since the beginning of 2023, which is taxed at a lower rate than the Latin American countries in which the Company operates. In addition, the Company recorded an increased foreign permanent tax benefit in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, related to an inflation index adjustment allowed in Mexico.

 Provision for lease losses decreased 8 to 130.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 141.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to a slight decrease in lease loss provisioning rates used during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the 2 decrease in gross transaction volumes. As a percentage of gross transaction volume, the provision for lease losses decreased from 31 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 29 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Retail Finance Operations 
 
 Interest and fees on finance receivables increased 1 to 175.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 174.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the higher year-over-year finance receivable balances, partially offset by a slight decline in portfolio yield primarily as a result of AFF expanding its offerings and merchant relationships in certain services sector verticals in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, some of which provide slightly lower interest rates. 
 
 Provision for loan losses increased 13 to 102.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 90.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to the 15 increase in gross transaction volumes partially offset by a slight decrease in the net provisioning rates used during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 based on lower than expected loss rates on older vintages. As a percentage of gross transaction volume, the provision for loan losses decreased from 30 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 29 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Segment Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses decreased slightly to 103.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 104.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of segment revenues, operating expenses were 14 during both the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. 
 
 Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income 
 
 The retail POS payment solutions segment pre-tax operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 89.2 million compared to 88.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of increased segment income resulting from slight increases in net revenue and a slight decrease in segment expenses.

 Corporate Expenses and Taxes 
 
 Administrative expenses increased 4 to 129.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 124.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the increase in pawn store count partially offset by decreased management incentive compensation expense. As a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses were 5 during both the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 11 to 39.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 44.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 5.4 million decrease in amortization of acquired AFF intangible assets. 
 
 Interest expense increased 17 to 78.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 66.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher floating interest rates on the Company s unsecured bank credit facilities and higher average total long-term debt balances outstanding. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Table of Contents 

Consolidated effective income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 24.9 and 25.7 , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in U.S.-sourced income as a result of the U.S. store acquisition activity since the beginning of 2023, which is taxed at a lower rate than the Latin American countries in which the Company operates. In addition, the Company recorded an increased foreign permanent tax benefit in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to an inflation index adjustment allowed in Mexico. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Material Capital Requirements 
 
 The Company s primary capital requirements include: 
 
 Expand pawn operations through growth of pawn receivables and inventories in existing stores, new store openings, strategic acquisitions of pawn stores and purchases of underlying real estate at existing locations; 
 Expand retail POS payment solutions operations through growth of the business generated from new and existing merchant partners; and 
 Return capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. 
 
 Other material capital requirements include operating expenses (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding operating lease commitments), maintenance capital expenditures related to its facilities, technology platforms, general corporate operating activities, income tax payments and debt service, among others. Net interest expense is expected to increase in 2024 compared to 2023 due to (i) increased borrowings primarily undertaken to fund recent acquisitions and (ii) anticipated higher floating interest rates on the borrowings under the revolving credit facilities. The Company believes that net cash provided by operating activities and available and unused funds under its revolving unsecured credit facilities will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital needs for these items over the next 12 months and also in the longer-term beyond the next 12 months. 
 
 Expand Pawn Operations 
 
 The Company intends to continue expansion of its pawn operations through growth of pawn receivables and inventories in existing stores along with new store openings and acquisitions. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company acquired 28 pawn stores in the U.S. and acquired one pawn license that was used to open a pawn store in the state of Nevada for a cumulative purchase price of 102.8 million, net of cash acquired and subject to future post-closing adjustments. The Company evaluates potential acquisitions based upon growth potential, purchase price, available liquidity, strategic fit and quality of management personnel, among other factors. 
 
 The Company has opened 55 new de novo stores in total through September 30, 2024 and for the full year of 2024 expects to add approximately 60 de novo locations. Future store openings are subject to the Company s ability to identify locations in markets with attractive demographics, available real estate with favorable leases and limited competition. 
 
 Although viewed by management as a discretionary expenditure not required to operate its pawn stores, the Company may continue to strategically purchase real estate from its landlords at existing stores or in conjunction with pawn store acquisitions as opportunities arise at reasonable valuations. The Company purchased the real estate at 43 store locations, primarily from landlords at existing stores, for a cumulative purchase price of 54.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Expand Retail POS Payment Solutions Operations 
 
 AFF expects to expand its business primarily by promoting and expanding relationships with both new and existing customers and retail merchant partners. In addition, AFF has made, and intends to continue to make, investments in its customer and merchant support operations and facilities, its technology platforms and its proprietary decisioning platforms and processes. In addition to utilizing cash flows generated from its own operations to fund expected 2024 growth, AFF has access to the additional sources of liquidity described below if needed to fund further expansion activities.

Return of Capital to Shareholders 
 
 In October 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a 0.38 per share fourth quarter cash dividend on common shares outstanding, or an aggregate of 17.0 million based on the September 30, 2024 share count, to be paid on November 27, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 15, 2024. While the Company currently expects to continue the payment of quarterly cash dividends, the amount, declaration and payment of cash dividends in the future (quarterly or otherwise) will be made by the Board of Directors, from time to time, subject to the Company s financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, compliance with legal requirements, debt covenant restrictions and other relevant factors. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased a total of 721,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 85.0 million and an average cost per share of 117.90. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 1,248,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 114.4 million and an average cost per share of 91.58. The aggregate cost and average cost per share do not include the effect of the 1 excise tax on certain share repurchases enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Company incurred 0.9 million and 1.1 million of excise taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 In July 2023, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program for up to 200.0 million of the Company s outstanding common stock, of which 115.0 million is currently remaining. The Company intends to continue repurchases under its active share repurchase program, including through open market transactions under trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, liquidity needs, credit availability, debt covenant restrictions, general business and economic conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of the Company s stock, the Company s dividend policy and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 The Company regularly evaluates opportunities to optimize its capital structure, including through consideration of the issuance of debt or equity, to refinance existing debt and to enter into interest rate hedge transactions, such as interest rate swap agreements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s primary sources of liquidity were 106.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and 527.8 million of available and unused funds under the Company s revolving unsecured credit facilities, subject to certain financial covenants (see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company had working capital of 1,020.9 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company s cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 included 33.9 million held by its foreign subsidiaries. These cash balances, which are primarily held in Mexican pesos, are associated with foreign earnings the Company has asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which the Company primarily plans to use to support its continued growth plans outside the U.S. through funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, operating expenses or other similar cash needs of the Company s foreign operations. 
 
 The Company s liquidity is affected by a number of factors, including changes in general customer traffic and demand, pawn loan balances, loan-to-value ratios, collection of pawn fees, merchandise sales, inventory levels, LTO merchandise, finance receivable balances, collection of lease and finance receivable payments, seasonality, operating expenses, administrative expenses, expenses related to merger and acquisition activities, litigation-related expenses, tax rates, gold prices, foreign currency exchange rates and the pace of new pawn store expansion and acquisitions. Additionally, a prolonged reduction in earnings and EBITDA could limit the Company s future ability to fully borrow on its credit facilities under current leverage covenants. Regulatory developments affecting the Company s operations may also impact profitability and liquidity. See Governmental Regulation Update. 
 
 If needed, the Company could seek to raise additional funds from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, repatriation of excess cash held in Latin America, the sale of assets, reductions in operating expenses, capital expenditures and dividends, the forbearance or deferral of operating expenses, the issuance of debt or equity securities, utilizing other structured financing arrangements, the leveraging of currently unencumbered real estate owned by the Company and/or changes to its management of current assets. The characteristics of the Company s current assets, specifically the ability to rapidly liquidate gold jewelry inventory, which accounts for 49 of total inventory, give the Company flexibility to quickly increase cash flow if necessary.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION UPDATE 
 
 The Company s pawn and retail POS payment solutions businesses are subject to significant regulation in all of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Existing regulations and regulatory developments are further and more completely described under Governmental Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 5, 2024 and in subsequent documents filed with the SEC. Other than as described below, there have been no changes to the significant regulation that the Company s businesses are subject to that the Company believes would have a material impact on its businesses or results of operation from those described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 On October 5, 2017, the CFPB released its small-dollar loan rule (the SDL Rule ), which was subsequently revised on July 7, 2020. Traditional possessory, non-recourse pawn loans are not covered under the SDL Rule. The SDL Rule defines some of the RISA transactions that AFF purchases and some of the bank loans that AFF sub-services as transactions that are covered under the rule. After resolution of some challenges to the SDL Rule itself and the constitutionality of the CFPB, on July 3, 2024, trade groups filed a petition for a rehearing with the Fifth Circuit en banc . If the Fifth Circuit does not grant the petition, the SDL Rule is expected to go into effect on March 30, 2025. The SDL Rule imposes certain obligations and limitations associated with the origination and servicing of covered transactions as of its effective date. At this time, the Company does not believe that the implementation of the SDL Rule, as proposed, will have a material impact on the Company s future results of operations or financial condition. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 The Company uses certain financial calculations such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and constant currency results as factors in the measurement and evaluation of the Company s operating performance and period-over-period growth. The Company derives these financial calculations on the basis of methodologies other than GAAP, primarily by excluding from a comparable GAAP measure certain items the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance. These financial calculations are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the SEC rules. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in operating its business because management believes they are less susceptible to variances in actual operating performance that can result from the excluded items, other infrequent charges and currency fluctuations. The Company presents these financial measures to investors because management believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the primary factors that drive the Company s core operating performance and provide greater transparency into the Company s results of operations. However, items that are excluded and other adjustments and assumptions that are made in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company s financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, the Company s GAAP financial measures. Further, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, the non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. 
 
 While acquisitions are an important part of the Company s overall strategy, the Company has adjusted the applicable financial calculations to exclude merger and acquisition expenses and amortization of acquired AFF intangible assets. The Company does not consider these items to be related to the organic operations of the acquired businesses or its continuing operations and are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired businesses. In addition, excluding these items allows for more accurate comparisons of the financial results to prior periods. Merger and acquisition expenses include incremental costs directly associated with merger and acquisition activities, including professional fees, legal expenses, severance, retention and other employee-related costs, contract breakage costs and costs related to the consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities, among others. 
 
 The Company has certain leases in Mexico which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The lease liability of these U.S. dollar-denominated leases, which is considered a monetary liability, is remeasured into Mexican pesos using current period exchange rates, resulting in the recognition of foreign currency exchange gains or losses. The Company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude these remeasurement gains or losses (i) because they are non-cash, non-operating items that could create volatility in the Company s consolidated results of operations due to the magnitude of the end of period lease liability being remeasured and (ii) to improve comparability of current periods presented with prior periods.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 
 
 Management believes the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of the Company s financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding items that management believes are non-operating in nature and are not representative of the Company s core operating performance. In addition, management believes the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare the Company s financial results for the current periods presented with the prior periods presented.

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 The Company defines EBITDA as net income before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and interest income and adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain items, as listed below, that management considers to be non-operating in nature and not representative of its actual operating performance. The Company believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are commonly used by investors to assess a company s financial performance, and adjusted EBITDA is used as a starting point in the calculation of the consolidated total debt ratio as defined in the Company s senior unsecured notes.

Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 
 For purposes of its internal liquidity assessments, the Company considers free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less purchases of furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements and net fundings/repayments of pawn loan and finance receivables, which are considered to be operating in nature by the Company but are included in cash flow from investing activities. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as free cash flow adjusted for merger and acquisition expenses paid that management considers to be non-operating in nature. 
 
 Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are commonly used by investors as additional measures of cash generated by business operations that may be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and debt service or, following payment of such debt obligations and other non-discretionary items, that may be available to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, repurchase stock, pay cash dividends or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. These metrics can also be used to evaluate the Company s ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company s liquidity. However, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 Constant Currency Results 
 
 The Company s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, however, certain performance metrics discussed in this report are presented on a constant currency basis, which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company s management uses constant currency results to evaluate operating results of business operations in Latin America, which are transacted in local currencies in Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia. The Company also has operations in El Salvador, where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. 
 
 The Company believes constant currency results provide valuable supplemental information regarding the underlying performance of its business operations in Latin America, consistent with how the Company s management evaluates such performance and operating results. Constant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating certain balance sheet and income statement items denominated in local currencies using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current comparable period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations for purposes of evaluating period-over-period comparisons. See the Latin America pawn segment tables in Results of Operations above for additional reconciliation of certain constant currency amounts to as reported GAAP amounts.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market risks relating to the Company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, gold prices and foreign currency exchange rates and are described in detail in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The impact of current-year fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, in particular, are further discussed in Part I, Item 2 herein. The Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. There have been no material changes to the Company s exposure to market risks since December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls will prevent all possible error and fraud. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are, however, designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.
