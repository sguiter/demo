Additionally, we own a 1/128th nonparticipating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest NPRI under approximately acres of land, a 1/16th NPRI under approximately acres of land, and approximately additional net royalty acres (normalized to 1/8th) NRA for a collective total of approximately NRA, principally concentrated in the Permian Basin. 
 
 Our revenues are derived from oil and gas royalties, water sales, produced water royalties, easements and other surface-related SLEM income and land sales. 
 
 On January 11, 2021, we completed our reorganization from a business trust, Texas Pacific Land Trust (the Trust ), organized under a Declaration of Trust dated February 1, 1888 (the Declaration of Trust ), into Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a corporation formed and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the Corporate Reorganization ). 
 
 Increase in Authorized Shares of Common Stock 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Company had authorized shares consisting of shares of preferred stock, par value per share Preferred Stock ), and shares of common stock, par value per share Common Stock ). On March 1, 2024, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, pursuant to which the Certificate of Incorporation was amended and restated to provide that the total number of authorized shares of capital stock of the Company be increased to shares of capital stock, consisting of shares of Preferred Stock and shares of Common Stock. 
 
 Common Stock Split 
 
 On March 26, 2024, we effected a -for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend of shares of Common Stock for every share of Common Stock outstanding to stockholders of record as of March 18, 2024. All shares, stock awards, restricted stock awards RSAs ), restricted stock units RSUs ), performance stock units PSUs and per share information have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The -for-one stock split was not applied to shares held as treasury stock. The shares of Common Stock retain a par value of per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was reclassified from Additional paid-in capital to Common Stock.

 acres of land along with other surface-related tangible and intangible assets (collectively referred to as the Acquired Assets from an unaffiliated seller for total consideration of million, in an all-cash transaction. There were no liabilities assumed by the Company in this transaction. The Acquired Assets generate revenue streams across water sales, produced water royalties, and SLEM revenue, and provide additional commercial growth opportunities for the Company to expand water sourcing and produced water opportunities to both new and existing customers. The Acquired Assets are located in the Midland Basin.

 The combination of the non-operating working interest and the royalty interest from the SWD system entitles the Company to of produced water revenues generated from the SWD system. As a non-operating working interest owner, the Company is also responsible for its share of operating expenses associated with the SWD system. The operator of the SWD system is responsible for the day-to-day management and operations. Of the acres of land acquired, approximately acres are leased to, and operated by, an environmental solution ES company that operates a nonhazardous oilfield solids waste disposal site. The ES company pays a royalty, on revenue generated, to the Company. The Company reports this as SLEM revenue. 
 
 The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, and therefore, the Acquired Assets were recorded based on their fair value on a nonrecurring basis on the date of acquisition and are subject to fair value adjustments under certain circumstances. When determining the fair values of assets acquired, management made estimates, judgements and assumptions. Inputs used to determine fair values of assets included internally-developed models, risk-adjusted discount rates by asset class, publicly available data on land sales comparisons and other costs analysis. These fair values are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy. There was no goodwill recorded on this acquisition. 
 
 The Company s determination of the fair value attributable to the Acquired Assets based on the fair value at the acquisition date is preliminary. Certain data necessary to complete the purchase price allocation is subject to change. We expect to complete the purchase price allocation prior to December 31, 2024, during which time the value of the assets may be revised as appropriate.

 -for-one stock split effected on March 26, 2024, the Plans were adjusted to increase the authorized number of shares that may be issued under the Plans. As of September 30, 2024, share-based compensation granted under the Plans has included these award types: stock awards, RSAs, RSUs and PSUs. Currently, all awards granted under the plans are entitled to receive dividends (which are accrued and distributed to award recipients upon vesting) or have dividend equivalent rights. Dividends and dividend equivalent rights are subject to the same vesting conditions as the awards to which they relate and are forfeitable if the related awards are forfeited. RSUs granted under the 2021 Plan vest in one-third increments and PSUs granted under the 2021 Plan cliff vest at the end of if the performance metrics are achieved (as discussed further below). RSAs granted prior to October 31, 2023 under the 2021 Directors Plan vested on the first anniversary of the award.

If the maximum amount of the performance metrics described in the PSU agreements are achieved, the actual number of shares that will ultimately be awarded under the PSU agreements will exceed target PSUs by (i.e., a collective additional shares would be issued). 
 
 Each PSU has a value equal to share of Common Stock. The PSUs will vest after grant if certain performance metrics are met, as follows: of the PSUs may be earned based on the Company s relative total stockholder return RTSR over the applicable measurement period compared to the SPDR S P Oil Gas Exploration Production ETF XOP Index ), and of the PSUs may be earned based on the cumulative free cash flow per share FCF over the vesting period. Because the RTSR PSU is a market-based award, its grant date fair value was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model that uses the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes model to determine the expected potential ranking of the Company against the XOP Index (i.e., the probability of satisfying the market condition defined in the award). Expected volatility in the model was estimated based on the volatility of historical stock prices over a period matching the expected term of the award. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury yield constant maturities for a term matching the expected term of the award. The inputs for the Monte Carlo simulation model are designated as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

Overview 

Texas Pacific Land Corporation (which, together with its subsidiaries as the context requires, may be referred to as TPL , the Company , our , we or us is one of the largest landowners in the State of Texas with approximately 873,000 surface acres of land, with the majority of our ownership concentrated in the Permian Basin. Additionally, we own a 1/128th nonparticipating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest NPRI under approximately 85,000 acres of land, a 1/16th NPRI under approximately 371,000 acres of land, and approximately 8,000 additional net royalty acres (normalized to 1/8th) NRA ), for a collective total of approximately 199,000 NRA, principally concentrated in the Permian Basin. 
 
 The Company was originally organized under a Declaration of Trust, dated February 1, 1888, to receive and hold title to extensive tracts of land in the State of Texas that were previously the property of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company. We completed our reorganization on January 11, 2021 from a business trust, Texas Pacific Land Trust, into Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a corporation formed and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. 
 
 We are not an oil and gas producer. Our business activity is generated from surface and royalty interest ownership, primarily in the Permian Basin. Our revenues are derived from oil and gas royalties, water sales, produced water royalties, easements and other surface-related income and land sales. Due to the nature of our operations and concentration of our ownership in one geographic location, our revenue and net income are subject to substantial fluctuations from quarter to quarter and year to year. In addition to fluctuations in response to changes in the market price for oil and gas, our financial results are also subject to decisions by not only the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells to which our oil and gas royalty interests relate, but also to other owners and operators in the Permian Basin as it relates to our other revenue streams, principally water sales, produced water royalties, easements, and other surface-related revenue.

 Market Conditions 
 
 While average oil prices for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 have increased slightly compared to average oil prices during the same period last year, average oil prices for the three months ended September 30, 2024 have decreased compared to the same period of 2023. Oil prices continue to be impacted by certain actions by OPEC+, geopolitics, and evolving global supply and demand trends, among other factors. Average natural gas prices during 2024 have decreased compared to average prior year natural gas prices. Global and domestic natural gas markets have experienced volatility due to macroeconomic conditions, infrastructure and logistical constraints, weather, and geopolitics, among other factors. Since mid-2022, the Waha Hub located in Pecos County, Texas has at times experienced significant negative price differentials relative to Henry Hub, located in Erath, Louisiana, due in part to growing local Permian natural gas production and limited natural gas pipeline takeaway capacity with 2024 having experienced negative Waha natural gas prices throughout much of the year. Midstream infrastructure is currently being developed by operators to provide additional takeaway capacity, though the impact on future basis differentials will be dependent on future natural gas production and other factors. Changes in global and domestic macro-economic conditions could result in additional shifts in oil and gas supply and demand in future periods. Although our revenues are directly and indirectly impacted by changes in oil and natural gas prices, we believe our royalty interests (which require no capital expenditures or operating expense burden from us for well development), strong balance sheet, and liquidity position will help us navigate through potential commodity price volatility. 

Permian Basin Activity 

The Permian Basin is one of the oldest and most well-known hydrocarbon-producing areas and currently accounts for a substantial portion of oil and gas production in the United States, covering approximately 86,000 square miles across southeastern New Mexico and western Texas. Exploration and production E P companies operating in the Permian Basin continue to maintain robust drilling and development activity. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Permian production is currently in excess of 6.0 million barrels per day, which is higher than the average daily production in this region for any year prior to 2024. 
 
 Due to our ownership concentration in the Permian Basin, our revenues are directly impacted by oil and gas pricing and drilling activity in the Permian Basin. Below are metrics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Oil and Gas Pricing Metrics: (1)

 (2) Permian Basin specific information per Enverus analytics. US weekly horizontal rig counts per Baker Hughes United States Rotary Rig Count for horizontal rigs. Statistics for similar data are also available from other sources. The comparability between these other sources and the sources used by the Company may differ. 
 
 The metrics above show selected domestic benchmark oil and natural gas prices and approximate activity levels in the Permian Basin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. While average oil prices for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 have increased slightly compared to the same period in 2023, average oil prices for the three months ended September 30, 2024 have decreased compared to the same period of 2023. Natural gas prices for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 have declined compared to the same period last year. E P companies broadly continue to deploy capital at a measured pace as drilling and development activities across the Permian Basin have remained strong overall. As we are a significant landowner in the Permian Basin and not an oil and gas producer, our revenue is affected by the development decisions made by companies that operate in the areas where we own royalty interests and land. Accordingly, these decisions made by others affect, both directly and indirectly, our oil and gas royalties, produced water royalties, water sales, and other surface-related income. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 
 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash flows generated from our operations. Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for capital expenditures related to our Water Services and Operations segment (the extent and timing of which are under our control), working capital and general corporate needs. 
 
 We continuously review our levels of liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change and our revenues were to decline significantly or our operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding. We had no debt, credit facilities or any off-balance sheet arrangements, as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 As we evaluate our current capital structure, capital allocation priorities, business fundamentals, and investment opportunities, we have set a target cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately 700 million. Above this target, we will seek to deploy the majority of our free cash flow towards additional dividends and share repurchases. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 533.9 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support our business, to repurchase our common stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Common Stock ), subject to market conditions, to pay dividends subject to the discretion of our board of directors (the Board ), for potential acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents balances, will be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Return of Capital to Shareholders 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid total dividends to our stockholders of 310.6 million, consisting of special cash dividends of 10.00 per share of Common Stock and regular quarterly cash dividends of 1.17 per share of Common Stock. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 22.7 million of our Common Stock (including share repurchases not settled at the end of the period). 
 
 Acquisition Activity 
 
 We completed two separate acquisitions in August 2024, each in an all-cash transaction. We acquired mineral interests across approximately 4,106 NRA located in Culberson County, Texas for a purchase price of 120.3 million, net of post-close adjustments. The acquisition was completed in conjunction with Brigham Royalties Fund I Holdco, L.L.C., a subsidiary of Brigham Royalties, in an arms-length transaction with an unaffiliated seller. See further discussion of this acquisition in Note 6, Oil and Gas Royalty Interests. The acquired mineral interests overlap with existing TPL royalty acreage. Additionally, we acquired 4,120 surface acres in Martin County, Texas along with other surface-related tangible and intangible assets in a business combination for total consideration of 45.0 million. See further discussion of this acquisition in Note 3, Assets Acquired in a Business Combination. 
 
 On October 2, 2024, we acquired approximately 7,490 NRA located primarily in the Midland Basin in Martin, Midland and other counties, with over 80 of the acquired interests adjacent to or overlapping existing TPL surface and royalty acreage for cash consideration of 276.4 million, 43.0 million of which was held in escrow as of September 30, 2024.

Development of Innovative Solutions for Produced Water and Capital Expenditures 
 
 In May 2024, we announced our progress towards developing innovative solutions for produced water in the Permian Basin. Over the last few years, we have been working with a leading industrial technology and manufacturing firm to develop an energy-efficient desalination and treatment process and associated equipment that can recycle produced water into fresh water with quality standards appropriate for surface discharge and beneficial reuse. With the Permian Basin generating approximately 18 million barrels of produced water per day, we believe this technology would provide an attractive and critical alternative to subsurface injection. We have successfully tested a pilot program in our research and development lab, and we are now working towards the next phase of constructing a facility with an initial capacity of 10,000 barrels of water per day. We filed a patent application for the desalination and treatment process and have secured exclusive use-rights for the equipment towards produced water applications. We are also in commercial discussions with the some of the largest, most active oil and gas upstream operators as we look to provide critical, technology-driven solutions while also optimizing our economic interests and limiting capital expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have spent 5.3 million on this new energy-efficient desalination and treatment process and equipment, of which 3.4 million was capitalized. 
 
 Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested approximately 18.4 million to maintain and/or enhance our water sourcing assets. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 364.1 million and 306.9 million, respectively. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is primarily from oil, gas and produced water royalties, water and land sales, easements, and other surface-related income. Cash flows used in operations generally consist of operating expenses associated with our revenue streams, general and administrative expenses and income taxes. 
 
 The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in operating income and changes in working capital requirements during 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 
 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 225.8 million and 55.9 million, respectively. Our cash flows used in investing activities are primarily related to acquisitions and capital expenditures related to our water services and operations segment. Our acquisitions may include land, royalty interests and other similar tangible and intangible assets. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the cash flows used for acquisitions, including a deposit for an acquisition, totaled 209.3 million and 45.3 million, respectively. For further information regarding acquisitions during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and thereafter, see Acquisition Activity above. Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 22.0 million and 10.4 million, respectively. 
 
 Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 335.0 million and 108.6 million, respectively. Our cash flows used in financing activities primarily consist of activities that return capital to our stockholders, such as payments of dividends and repurchases of our Common Stock. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid total dividends of 310.6 million and 75.0 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 22.7 million and 32.2 million of our Common Stock, respectively (including share repurchases not settled at the end of the period).

 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Consolidated Revenues and Net Income: 
 
 Total revenues increased 9.9 , to 173.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 158.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in total revenues was principally related to a 9.8 million increase in water sales, a 7.3 million increase in oil and gas royalty revenue, and a 6.9 million increase in produced water royalties, partially offset by a decrease in easements and other surface-related income and land sales over the same period. Individual revenue line items are discussed below under Segment Results of Operations. Net income of 106.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was slightly higher than the comparable period of 2023 as a result of an increase in total revenues, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, as discussed below. 
 
 Consolidated Expenses: 
 
 Salaries and related employee expenses . Salaries and related employee expenses were 14.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 11.5 million for the comparable period of 2023. The number of employees increased from 101 as of September 30, 2023 to 110 as of September 30, 2024, which, when coupled with market compensation adjustments effective at the beginning of 2024, resulted in increased salary and related employee expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Additionally, contract labor expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased over the same period of 2023, principally as a result of the 37.0 increase in water sales over the same respective periods.

Table of Contents 

 Water service-related expenses . Water service-related expenses increased 3.2 million to 11.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Certain types of water-related expenses, including, but not limited to, treatment, transfer, water purchases, repairs and maintenance, equipment rental, and fuel costs, vary from period to period as our customers needs and requirements change. Right of way and other expenses also vary from period to period depending upon location of customer delivery. The increase in water service-related expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was principally related to a 37.0 increase in water sales due to increased volumes. 
 
 Legal and professional fees . Legal and professional fees were 8.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.7 million for the comparable period of 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred additional consulting and legal fees related to the Company s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, including fees incurred in connection with the preparation of the related proxy statement and addressing stockholder proposals and director nominations from unaffiliated stockholders who ultimately determined to withdraw their director nominations shortly before the filing of the Company s proxy statement for the Company s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. 
 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization . Depreciation, depletion and amortization was 5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.6 million for the comparable period of 2023. The increase was principally due to depletion expense associated with royalty interests acquired in August 2024, as discussed further above under Liquidity and Capital Resources Acquisition Activity . 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Consolidated Revenues and Net Income: 
 
 Total revenues increased to 520.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 464.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in total revenues was principally due to a 28.2 million increase in water sales, a 17.7 million increase in oil and gas royalty revenue, and a 14.2 million increase in produced water royalties compared to the same period of 2023. These revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease of 4.7 million in land sales. Individual revenue line items are discussed below under Segment Results of Operations. Net income of 335.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.7 higher than the comparable period of 2023, principally as a result of the increase in revenues discussed above. 
 
 Consolidated Expenses: 
 
 Salaries and related employee expenses . Salaries and related employee expenses were 39.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 32.7 million for the same period of 2023. The number of employees increased from 101 as of September 30, 2023 to 110 as of September 30, 2024, which, when coupled with market compensation adjustments effective at the beginning of 2024, resulted in increased salary and related employee expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Additionally, contract labor expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased over the same period of 2023, principally as a result of the 32.9 increase in water sales over the same respective periods. 
 
 Water service-related expenses . Water service-related expenses increased 12.3 million to 36.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Certain types of water-related expenses, including, but not limited to, treatment, transfer, water purchases, repairs and maintenance, equipment rental, and fuel costs, vary from period to period as our customers needs and requirements change. Right of way and other expenses also vary from period to period depending upon location of customer delivery. The increase in water service-related expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was principally related to a 32.9 increase in water sales over the same period of 2023, primarily as a result of increased customer volumes. Research and development expenses related to development of a new energy-efficient method of produced water desalination and treatment were 1.9 million and 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For further discussion of this new treatment method, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Development of Innovative Solutions for Produced Water and Capital Expenditures . 
 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 1.9 million to 12.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock awards that were vested in full on the grant date were granted to members of the Board which resulted in immediate recognition of the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. See further discussion of this change in Note 8, Share-Based Compensation in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 one-time event. Additionally, expenses for corporate insurance, resulting from increased coverages and insurance rates, and technology applications for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased over the same period of 2023. 
 
 Legal and professional fees . Legal and professional fees were 14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 28.5 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease in legal and professional fees was principally related to a reduction in legal expenses associated with stockholder matters that occurred during the prior year. 
 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization . Depreciation, depletion and amortization was 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is principally due to additional depletion expense associated with royalty interests acquired in August 2024 and additional amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired in August 2023 and August 2024. 
 
 Other income, net . Other income, net was 31.2 million and 20.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in other income, net was primarily related to increased interest income earned on our cash balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from higher cash balances and interest rates during the period. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 1.9 million of proceeds from a settlement with a title company regarding a defect in title to property acquired in a prior year. 
 
 Total income tax expense. Total income tax expense was 92.2 million and 79.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily related to increased operating income resulting from increased consolidated revenues. 

Segment Results of Operations 

We operate our business in two reportable segments: Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations. We eliminate any inter-segment revenues and expenses upon consolidation. 
 
 We evaluate the performance of our operating segments separately to monitor the different factors affecting financial results. The reportable segments presented are consistent with our reportable segments discussed in Note 14, Business Segment Reporting in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We monitor our reporting segments based upon revenue and net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). 
 
 Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 continued to benefit from activity in the Permian Basin. Our oil and gas royalty revenues increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased royalty production. Additionally, revenues derived from water sales and produced water royalties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also positively impacted by our active management of our surface and royalty interests in recent years.

 Land and Resource Management segment revenues decreased 3.3 million to 106.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease in Land and Resource Management segment revenues was related to a 6.1 million decrease in easements and other surface-related income and a 4.5 million decrease in land sales, partially offset by a 7.3 million increase in oil and gas royalty revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 Oil and gas royalties. Oil and gas royalty revenue was 94.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 87.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 7.3 million. Our share of production increased to 28.3 thousand barrels of oil equivalent Boe per day for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.8 thousand Boe per day for the same period of 2023. The average realized price decreased 16.2 to 38.04 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 45.41 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 The financial and operational data by royalty stream is presented in the table below for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Our share of production volumes (1) :

 (1) Commonly used definitions in the oil and gas industry not previously defined: MBbls represents one thousand barrels of crude oil, condensate or NGLs. Mcf represents one thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMcf represents one million cubic feet of natural gas. MBoe represents one thousand Boe. MBoe/d represents one thousand Boe per day. 
 
 Easements and other surface-related income. Easements and other surface-related income was 11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6.1 million compared to 17.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Easements and other surface-related income includes revenue related to the use and crossing of our land for oil and gas exploration and production, renewable energy, and agricultural operations. The decrease in easements and other surface-related income was principally related to decreases of 3.4 million in pipeline easements and 2.3 million in wellbore easements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Easements and other surface-related income is dependent on development decisions made by companies that operate in the areas where we own land and is, therefore, unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period. See Market Conditions above for additional discussion of development activity in the Permian Basin during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net income. Net income for the Land and Resource Management segment decreased 13.3 to 71.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 82.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Segment operating income decreased 13.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, driven by a 6.6 million increase in legal and professional fees and a 3.3 million decrease in segment revenues. Expenses are discussed further above under Results of Operations - Consolidated. 
 
 Water Services and Operations 
 
 Water Services and Operations segment revenues increased 39.3 to 66.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to revenues of 48.0 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in Water Services and Operations segment revenues was principally due to an increase of 9.8 million in water sales revenue and 6.9 million in produced water royalties. As discussed in Market Conditions above, our segment revenues are directly influenced by development decisions made by our customers and the overall activity level in the Permian Basin. Accordingly, our segment revenues and sales volumes, as further discussed below, fluctuate from period to period based upon those decisions and activity levels.

Table of Contents 

Water sales . Water sales revenue increased 9.8 million to 36.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. The growth in water sales was principally due to an increase of 32.1 in water sales volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 Produced water royalties. Produced water royalties are received from the transfer or disposal of produced water on our land. Produced water royalties are contractual and not paid as a matter of right. We do not operate any salt water disposal wells. Produced water royalties were 27.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.8 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was principally due to increased produced water volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 Net income . Net income for the Water Services and Operations segment was 34.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 22.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Segment operating income increased 13.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was principally due to the 18.9 million increase in segment revenues, partially offset by the 3.2 million increase in water service-related expenses. Expenses are discussed further above under Results of Operations - Consolidated. 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

 Land and Resource Management 
 
 Land and Resource Management segment revenues were 322.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 315.3 million for the comparable period of 2023. The increase in Land and Resource Management segment revenues was principally due to the 17.7 million increase in oil and gas royalty revenue, partially offset by decreases of 6.2 million and 4.7 million in easements and other surface-related income and land sales, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 Oil and gas royalties . Oil and gas royalty revenue was 276.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 258.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 17.7 million. Oil and gas royalties 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included an 8.7 million recovery with an operator with respect to unpaid oil and gas royalties for older production periods. Excluding the impact of the 8.7 million recovery on 2023 revenue, oil and gas royalties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 26.4 million over the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher production volumes and average oil and NGL realized prices over the same periods. Our share of production increased to 26.0 thousand Boe per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 22.6 thousand Boe per day for the same period of 2023. The average realized prices decreased to 40.60 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 42.49 per Boe for the same period of 2023. 
 
 The table below provides financial and operational data by royalty stream for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (1)

 (1) The metrics and dollars provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 exclude the impact of the 8.7 million settlement of oil and gas royalties discussed above. 
 
 Easements and other surface-related income. Easements and other surface-related income was 43.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6.2 million compared to 49.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Easements and other surface-related income includes revenue related to the use and crossing of our land for oil and gas exploration and production, renewable energy, and agricultural operations. The decrease in easements and other surface-related income is principally related to a decrease of 4.7 million in wellbore easements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Easements and other surface-related income is dependent on development decisions made by companies that operate in the areas where we own land and is, therefore, unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period. See Market Conditions above for additional discussion of development activity in the Permian Basin during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Land sales . Land sales were 2.1 million and 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 91 acres of land for an aggregate sales price of 2.1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 18,061 acres of land for an aggregate sales price of 6.8 million. 
 
 Net income . Net income for the Land and Resource Management segment increased 15.1 million to 233.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 217.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 Segment operating income increased 14.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, largely driven by a 13.7 million decrease in legal and professional fees. Expenses are discussed further above under Results of Operations - Consolidated. 
 
 Water Services and Operations 
 
 Water Services and Operations segment revenues increased 32.2 to 197.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to revenues of 149.7 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in Water Services and Operations segment revenues was principally due to increases in water sales revenue and produced water royalties, which are discussed below. As discussed in Market Conditions above, our segment revenues are directly influenced by development decisions made by our customers and the overall activity level in the Permian Basin. Accordingly, our segment revenues and sales volumes, as further discussed below, fluctuate from period to period based upon those decisions and activity levels. 
 
 Water sales . Water sales revenue increased 28.2 million, or 32.9 to 114.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The growth in water sales was principally due to an increase of 27.6 in water sales volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 Produced water royalties. Produced water royalties are royalties received from the transfer or disposal of produced water on our land. Produced water royalties are contractual and not paid as a matter of right. We do not operate any salt water disposal wells. Produced water royalties were 76.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 61.8 million for the comparable period of 2023. This increase in produced water royalties was principally due to increased produced water volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 Easements and other surface-related income . Easements and other surface-related income was 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.8 million compared to 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in easements and other surface-related income primarily related to an increase in temporary permits for sourced water lines for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Net income . Net income for the Water Services and Operations segment was 102.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 74.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Segment operating income increased 30.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was principally due to a 48.2 million increase in segment revenues, partially offset by a 12.3 million increase in water service-related expenses. Expenses are discussed further above under Results of Operations - Consolidated. 

Non-GAAP Performance Measures 
 
 In addition to amounts presented in accordance with GAAP, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP performance measurements. These measurements are not to be considered more relevant or accurate than the measurements presented in accordance with GAAP. In compliance with the requirements of the SEC, our non-GAAP measurements are reconciled to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure. For all non-GAAP measurements, neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on these non-GAAP measurements. 
 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow 
 
 EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measurement of earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Its purpose is to highlight earnings without finance, taxes, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and its use is limited to specialized analysis. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus employee share-based compensation. Its purpose is to highlight earnings without non-cash activity such as share-based compensation and other non-recurring or unusual items, if applicable. We calculate Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less current income tax expense and capital expenditures. Its purpose is to provide an additional measure of operating performance. We have presented EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow because we believe that these metrics are useful supplements to net income in analyzing the Company's operating performance. Our definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies.
