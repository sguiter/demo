Upon shipment of products to its customers, the Company estimates expenses for the cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty and accrues a liability in cost of product revenues for this amount.

The Company estimates and adjusts these accruals at each balance sheet date in accordance with changes in these factors.

To facilitate sales of its products in the normal course of business, the Company indemnifies its resellers and end-user customers with respect to certain matters. The Company has agreed to hold the customer harmless against losses arising from intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. It is not possible to estimate the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.

Total liabilities measured at fair value 

Level 1 Assets and Liabilities: The Company s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. The Company states accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment. Level 2 Assets and Liabilities: The Company's level 2 assets consist of certificates of deposit and derivative instruments. Certificates of deposit do not have regular market pricing and are considered Level 2. The fair value of derivative instruments under the Company s foreign exchange forward contracts are estimated based on valuations provided by alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs, which is considered Level 2. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had investment in certificates of deposit of million and million, respectively, with maturity of three months at the date of purchase, which are recorded as cash equivalents in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company considers these cash equivalents to be available-for-sale and, as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, their fair value approximated their amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had foreign exchange forward contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments with notional principal amounts of million and million, respectively. These contracts currently have maturities of days or less. Changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments are included in 'Other income (expense), net' in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net gains and losses recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of operations from these contracts were net gains of million and net losses of less than million , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, there were outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that were designated as hedging instruments. See Note 12, Derivatives and Hedging , for additional information. The fair value of borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 7) is estimated based on valuations provided by alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs which is considered Level 2. Since the interest rate is variable in the 2023 Credit Agreement, the fair value approximates the face amount of the Company s indebtedness of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Level 3 Assets and Liabilities: Certain of the Company s assets, including intangible assets and goodwill, are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 , the Company did t have any assets or liabilities that were considered Level 3.

On August 9, 2019, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2019 Credit Agreement ), by and among the Company, as borrower, several banks and other financial institutions as Lenders, BMO Harris Bank N.A., as an issuing lender and swingline lender, Silicon Valley Bank, as an Issuing Lender, and Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders which was subsequently amended during fiscal 2023.

million first lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount (the 2023 Term Loan ), ii) a million revolving credit facility (the 2023 Revolving Facility and, iii) an uncommitted additional incremental loan facility in the principal amount of up to million. Borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement bear interest, and at the Company s election, the initial term loan may be made as either a base rate loan or a Secured Overnight Funding Rate SOFR loan. The applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from to per annum, and the applicable margin for SOFR loans ranges from to , in each case based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio. All SOFR loans are subject to a floor of per annum and spread adjustment of per annum. The Company paid other closing fees, arrangement fees, and administration fees associated with the 2023 Credit Agreement. The 2023 Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain certain minimum financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter. The 2023 Credit Agreement also includes covenants and restrictions that limit, among other things, the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens upon any of its property, merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The 2023 Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default which may result in acceleration of the outstanding balance. On August 14, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment Number One to the 2023 Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement ). Under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company modified the definition of the consolidated EBITDA for the purposes of evaluating compliance with financial covenants under the 2023 Credit Agreement. The amended definition of consolidated EBITDA modifies the amount and type of add-backs that are allowable to better align with the Company's operations and activities. Further, the Amended Credit Agreement provides a waiver for the Company's compliance with the consolidated interest charge coverage ratio for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2024, September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all the terms and financial covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement . Financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining and modifying long-term financing are deferred and amortized over the term of the related indebtedness or credit agreement. Amortization of deferred financing costs are included in Interest expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company capitalized approximately million of debt cost related to the Amended Credit Agreement. The remaining unamortized debt issuance cost related to the prior arrangement and the newly capitalized costs will be amortized over the remaining term of the loan arrangement. Amortization of debt issuance costs included in Interest expense were million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The interest rate as of September 30, 2024 was and as of September 30, 2023 was . As of September 30, 2024 , the Company did t have any outstanding balance against its 2023 Revolving Facility. The Company had million of availability under the 2023 Revolving Facility as of September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company did t make any additional payments against its term loan facility other than the scheduled payments per the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company h ad million of outstanding letters of credit as of September 30, 2024 . 

 million of inventory. Legal Proceedings The Company may from time to time be party to litigation arising in the course of its business, including, without limitation, allegations relating to commercial transactions, business relationships, or intellectual property rights. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Litigation in general, and intellectual property litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company records accruals for certain of its outstanding legal proceedings, investigations or claims when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

million shares, which is pending ratification by the stockholders of the Company at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held on November 14, 2024. Common Stock Repurchases On May 18, 2022, the Company announced the Board had authorized management to repurchase up to million shares of the Company s common stock over a period commencing (as amended, the 2022 Repurchase Program ). Initially, under the 2022 Repurchase Program, a maximum of million of shares was authorized to be repurchased in any quarter; however, on November 17, 2022, the Board increased the authorization to repurchase shares in any quarter from up to million of shares per quarter to up to million of shares per quarter. Purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company did t repurchase any shares of its common stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company repurchased a total of shares of its common stock on the open market at a total cost of mi llion with an average price of per share. As of September 30, 2024, approximately million remains available for share repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program. As a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act enacted in the U.S., the Company is subject to an excise tax on corporate stock repurchases, which is assessed as percent of the fair market value of net corporate stock repurchases af ter December 31, 2022. The Company had no excise tax liability for fiscal 2024 and expects the impact of the excise tax on net corporate stock repurchases will not be material for fiscal 2025.

 Extreme Networks, Inc. Extreme or Company is a leading provider of cloud networking solutions and industry leading services and support. Extreme designs, develops, and manufactures wired, wireless, and software-defined wide area-network SD-WAN infrastructure equipment, software and cloud-based network management solutions. The Company s cloud solution is a single platform that offers unified network management of wireless access points, switches, and SD-WAN. It leverages machine learning, Artificial Intelligence for Information Technology Operations AIOps and analytics to help customers deliver secure connectivity at the edge of the network, speed cloud deployments, and uncover actionable insights to save time, lower costs and streamline operations. 
 Extreme has been pushing the boundaries of networking technology since 1996, driven by a higher purpose of helping our customers connect beyond the network. Extreme s cloud networking technologies provide flexibility and scalability in deployment, management, and licensing of networks globally. Our global footprint provides service to some of the world s leading names in business, hospitality, retail, transportation and logistics, education, government, healthcare, manufacturing and service providers. We derive all our revenues from the sale of our networking equipment, software subscriptions, and related maintenance contracts. 
 Industry Background 
 Enterprises across every industry are going through unprecedented changes, such as leading digital initiatives, migrating their workloads to cloud-based environments, modernizing applications, finding new ways to leverage generative AI GenAI technology, and adopting to a distributed workforce. In order to accomplish this, they are adopting new Information Technology IT delivery models and applications that require fundamental network alterations and enhancements spanning from the access edge to the data center. As networks become more complex and more distributed in nature, we believe IT teams in every industry will need more control and better insights than ever before to ensure secure, distributed connectivity and comprehensive centralized visibility. Networking is mission critical and touches all elements of how services are delivered to customers, employees, students, and patients. Managing networks from cloud-based applications where customers can run their entire end-to-end networks, from wired or wireless infrastructure to SD-WAN, while ensuring full IT management of the business becomes critical. In addition, Machine Learning ML and GenAI technologies have the potential to vastly improve the network experience in today's world by collating large data sets to increase accuracy and derive resolutions to improve the operation of the network. When ML and GenAI are applied with cloud-driven networking and automation, administrators can quickly scale to provide productivity, availability, accessibility, manageability, security, and speed, regardless of the distribution of the network. 
 As the edge of the network continues to expand, our customers are managing more endpoints which comes with a host of challenges. This continued expansion creates issues such as a higher risk of cyberattacks and a need for more bandwidth as a result of an increase in applications running across the network. 
 24 

Network complexity manifests itself in the form of more endpoints to manage, more applications to monitor, and more services that rely on the network for service delivery and enablement. When performance suffers, and the tug on internal systems and IT staff becomes more intense, technology is often being overworked. Resolving network problems expeditiously and identifying their root cause can improve organizational productivity and result in higher performance of operations. 
 We believe that the network has never been more vital than it is today. As administrators grapple with more data, coming from more places, more connected devices, and more Software-as-a-Service SaaS based applications, the cloud is fundamental to managing and maintaining a modern network. Traditional network offerings are not well-suited to fulfill enterprise expectations for rapid delivery of new services, more flexible business models, real-time response, and massive scalability. 
 As enterprises continue to migrate increasing numbers of applications and services to either private clouds or public clouds offered by third parties and to adopt new IT delivery models and applications, they are required to make fundamental network alterations and enhancements spanning from device access points APs to the network core. In either case, the network infrastructure must adapt to this new dynamic environment. Intelligence and automation are key if enterprises are to derive maximum benefit from their cloud deployments. With automation applications becoming increasingly critical in manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, healthcare and other key industries, we believe this will continue to create demand for networking technology to serve as a foundation to run these services. 
 Service providers are investing in network enhancements with platforms and applications that deliver data insights, provide flexibility, and can quickly respond to new user demands and 5G use cases. 
 We believe Extreme will continue to benefit from the use of its technology to manage distributed campus network architecture centrally from the cloud. Extreme has blended a dynamic fabric attach architecture that delivers simplicity for moves and changes at the edge of the network together with corporate-wide role-based policy. This enables customers to migrate to new cloud managed switching, Wi-Fi, and SD-WAN, agnostic of the existing switching or wireless equipment they already have installed. In the end, we expect these customers to see lower operating and capital expenditures, lower subscription costs, lower overall cost of ownership, and more flexibility along with a more resilient network. 
 We estimate the total addressable market for our Enterprise Networking solutions consisting of cloud networking, wireless local area networks WLAN ), data center networking, ethernet switching, campus local area networks LAN ), SD-WAN solutions and management, automation, and elements of the Secure Access Services Edge SASE market to be over 47 billion, and growing at approximately 13 annually over the next five years. This comprises over 36 billion for networking and infrastructure spanning enterprise and service provider (largely 5G) applications, and 11 billion for networking cloud and security software, which is expected to grow to 31 billion by 2028.

We generate product revenues primarily from sales of our networking equipment. We derive subscription and support revenues primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings which includes SaaS offerings, maintenance contracts, professional services and training for our products. 
 Product revenues decreased 91.2 million or 36.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2024. The decrease in product revenues was primarily driven by lower bookings, shipments and lower channel sell-through caused by current macroeconomic conditions. 
 Subscription and support revenues increased 7.3 million or 7.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2024. The increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily due to the continued growth in our subscription business.

Product gross profit decreased 52.1 million or 35.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2024. The decrease in product gross profit was primarily due to lower product revenues, partially offset by lower reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, lower intangible asset amortization due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized, lower distribution costs due to lower shipments and lower warranty reserves. 
 Subscription and support gross profit increased 8.6 million or 12.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2024. The increase in subscription and support gross profit was primarily due to increased subscription and support revenues as well as lower personnel costs partially offset by increased subscription costs.

Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (which consist of compensation, benefits and share-based compensation), consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design, development, and testing of our products. 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 3.6 million or 6.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2024. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to a 2.7 million decrease in personnel costs due to lower compensation and benefits costs and a 2.6 million decrease in contractor costs partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in engineering project costs, a 0.7 million increase in information technology and facilities costs, and 0.4 million increase in other expenses primarily recruiting and professional fees. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (which consist of compensation, benefits and share-based compensation), as well as trade shows and promotional expenses. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 10.5 million or 11.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2024. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a 9.2 million decrease in personnel costs primarily due to lower headcount, a 1.0 million decrease in travel costs and a 0.3 million decrease in professional fees. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (which consist of compensation, benefits and share-based compensation), legal and professional service costs, and facilities and information technology costs. 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 12.7 million or 53.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2024. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a 9.3 million increase in litigation charges due to an additional accrual for an ongoing litigation matter and a 4.8 million increase in system transition costs, partially offset by a 1.4 million decrease in equipment related expenses primarily due to lower depreciation and software maintenance costs. 
 Restructuring and Related Charges 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded restructuring and related charges of 1.3 million, which primarily consisted of additional severance and benefits costs and professional services fees associated with the reduction-in-force actions related to the Q2 2024 Plan , and "Q3 2024 Plan", each as described in Note 13, Restructuring and Related Charges , in Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded restructuring and related charges of 2.7 million, which primarily consisted of costs associated with the headcount reduction related to the reduction-in-force plan executed during the first quarter in fiscal 2024. 
 30 

Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded 0.5 million of operating expenses for each period related to the amortization of intangible assets. 
 Interest Income 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded 0.8 million and 1.2 million, respectively, in interest income. The decrease in interest income was primarily related to the lower interest earned on our cash accounts due to lower cash and cash equivalents balances held during the first quarter in fiscal 2025. 
 Interest Expense 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded 4.4 million and 4.3 million, respectively, in interest expense. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average rates under the Amended Credit Agreement, as defined below. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded other expense, net of 0.7 million and other income, net of 0.4 million, respectively. The other income (expense), net for each period primarily related to the foreign exchange impact from the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded income tax provision of 1.5 million and 4.6 million, respectively. 
 The income tax provisions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of (1) taxes on the income of our foreign subsidiaries, (2) state taxes in jurisdictions where we have no remaining state net operating losses, (3) foreign withholding taxes, and (4) tax expense associated with the establishment of a U.S. deferred tax liability for amortizable goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Enterasys Networks, Inc., the WLAN business from Zebra Technologies Corporation, the Campus Fabric Business from Avaya LLC and the Data Center Business from Brocade Communications System. In addition, the income tax provision (benefit) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 includes U.S. federal income tax expense of 1.4 million. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Report are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted under SEC rules and regulations. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected. 
 As discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, we consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements: 
 Revenue Recognition 

Inventory Valuation and Purchase Commitments 

There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies since the filing of our last Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following table summarizes information regarding our cash and cash equivalents (in thousands):

Cash and cash equivalents 

159,546

31 

As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 159.5 million, accounts receivable, net of 97.2 million, and available borrowings under our 2023 Revolving Facility of 135.8 million. Our principal uses of cash include the purchase of finished goods inventory from our contract manufacturers, payroll and other operating expenses related to the development and marketing of our products, purchases of property and equipment, and repayments of debt and related interest and share repurchases. We believe that our 159.5 million of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, our cash flow from operations and the availability of borrowings from the 2023 Revolving Facility will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next 12 months and into the foreseeable future. 
 On May 18, 2022, our Board of Directors (the Board authorized management to repurchase up to 200.0 million shares of our common stock over a three-year period commencing July 1, 2022 (as amended, the "2022 Repurchase Program"). A maximum of 25.0 million may be repurchased in any quarter. On November 17, 2022, the Board increased the authorization to repurchase in any quarter from 25.0 million per quarter to 50.0 million per quarter. Purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or pursuant to 10b5-1 plan. The manner, timing and amount of any future purchases will be determined by our management based on their evaluation of market conditions, stock price, Extreme s ongoing determination that it is the best use of available cash and other factors. The 2022 Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any shares of its common stock, may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice and will be subject to regulatory considerations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 50.3 million available under the 2022 Repurchase Program. 
 On August 9, 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2019 Credit Agreement ), by and among Extreme, as borrower, several banks and other financial institutions as Lenders, BMO Harris Bank N.A., as an issuing lender and swingline lender, Silicon Valley Bank, as an Issuing Lender, and Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders. 
 On June 22, 2023, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2023 Credit Agreement by and among Extreme, as borrower, BMO Harris Bank, N.A., as an issuing lender and swingline lender, Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., PNC Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as issuing lenders, the financial institutions or entities party thereto as lenders, and Bank of Montreal, as an administrative agent and collateral agent, which amended and restated the 2019 Credit Agreement. The 2023 Credit Agreement provides for i) a 200.0 million first lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount (the Term Facility ), ii) a 150.0 million five-year revolving credit facility (the 2023 Revolving Facility and iii) an uncommitted additional incremental loan facility in the principal amount of up to 100.0 million plus an unlimited amount that is subject to pro forma compliance with a specified Consolidated Leverage Ratio tests. We may use the proceeds of the loans for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 At our election, the initial term loan (the Initial Term Loan under the 2023 Credit Agreement may be made as either a base rate loan or a Secured Overnight Financing Data Rate loan SOFR loan ). The applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from 1.00 to 1.75 per annum, and the applicable margin for SOFR loans ranges from 2.00 to 2.75 , in each case based on the Company s Consolidated Leverage Ratio. All SOFR loans are subject to a floor of 0.00 per annum and spread adjustment of 0.10 per annum. We also agreed to pay other closing fees, arrangement fees, and administration fees. 
 The 2023 Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain minimum financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter. The 2023 Credit Agreement also includes covenants and restrictions that limit, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens upon any of its property, merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The 2023 Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default which may result in acceleration of the outstanding balance . 
 On August 14, 2024, we entered into an Amendment Number One to the 2023 Credit Agreement the Amended Credit Agreement." Under the Amended Credit Agreement, we modified the definition of the consolidated EBITDA for the purposes of evaluating compliance with financial covenants under the 2023 Credit Agreement. The amended definition of consolidated EBITDA modifies the amount and type of add-backs that are allowable to better align with our operations and activities. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the modified terms and financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement.

 Cash flows provided by operations in the three months ended September 30, 2023 were 75.6 million, including our net income of 28.7 million and non-cash expenses of 43.3 million for items such as amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, depreciation, reduction in carrying amount of right-of-use assets, deferred income taxes, provision for excess or obsolete and interest. Other sources of cash for the period included a decrease in accounts receivable, and an increase in deferred revenue and other accrued liabilities.

 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Cash flows used in financing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 9.1 million primarily due to a payment of 5.9 million for taxes paid on vested and released stock awards net of proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP and exercise of stock options, a payment of 0.7 million for debt financing costs related to the Amended Credit Agreement, and a debt repayment of 2.5 million.

 Foreign Currency Effect on Cash and cash equivalents 
 Foreign currency effect on cash and cash equivalents increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and particularly the Indian Rupee, the UK Pound and the Euro. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had contractual obligations resulting from our debt arrangement, agreements to purchase goods and services in the ordinary course of business and obligations under our operating lease arrangements. 
 Our debt obligations relate to amounts owed under our Amended Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we had 187.5 million of debt outstanding, which is payable on quarterly installments through our fiscal year 2028. We are subject to interest on our debt obligations and unused commitment fee. See Note 7, Debt , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information regarding our debt obligations. 
 33 

Our unconditional purchase obligations represent the purchase of long lead-time component inventory that our contract manufacturers procure in accordance with our forecast. We expect to honor the inventory purchase commitments within the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, we had non-cancelable commitments to purchase 37.3 million of inventory. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our purchase obligations. 
 We have contractual commitments to our suppliers which represent commitments for future services. As of September 30, 2024, we had contractual commitments of 23.7 million that are due through our fiscal year 2027. 
 We lease facilities under operating lease arrangements at various locations that expire at various dates through our fiscal year 2033. As of September 30, 2024, the value of our obligations under operating leases was 60.6 million. 
 We have immaterial income tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement of those liabilities. 
 We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2024. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt and foreign currencies. 
 Debt 
 At certain points in time, we are exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, primarily in the form of variable rate borrowings from the Amended Credit Agreement, which is described in Note 7, Debt , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. At September 30, 2024, we had 187.5 million of debt outstanding, all of which was from the Amended Credit Agreement. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the average daily outstanding amount was 196.7 million, with a high of 210.0 million and a low of 187.5 million. 
 The following table presents hypothetical changes in interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, on the outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in thousands):

The underlying interest rate was 7.52 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Exchange Rate Sensitivity 
 A majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in United States Dollars. While we conduct some sales transactions and incur certain operating expenses in foreign currencies and expect to continue to do so, we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant, in part because of our foreign exchange risk management process discussed below. 
 Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts 
 We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of gains and losses generated by the foreign currency forecast transactions related to certain operating expenses and re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts are offset largely by re-measurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments, had a notional amount of 42.6 million and 18.7 million, respectively. These contracts have maturities of less than 40 days. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in Other income (expense), net." 
 Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from operations were losses of 1.4 million and gains 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and the Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Our controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our control system s objective will be met, and our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Extreme Networks have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Notwithstanding these limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are, in fact, effective at the reasonable assurance level.
