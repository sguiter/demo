We evaluate inventories to identify excess, high-cost, slow-moving or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins. Due to the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying values of inventories. Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions, inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. If our assumptions about future demand change, or market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs of inventories or valuation allowances may be required. In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated.

Balance at September 30, 2024 

Our investment in securities as of September 30, 2024 relates to shares of preferred convertible debt of Zowie Technology Corporation (Taipei Hsien, Taiwan), a supplier of electronic component products, with our option after three (3) years to convert into common stock or refundable bearing 7 annual interest rate. Our investment represents approximately of their total outstanding shares, although we do not have significant influence or control. This investment is accounted for under the cost (plus impairment) basis of accounting, however when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of the Company. Forward-looking statements usually are denoted by words or phrases such as believes, expects, projects, estimates, anticipates, will likely result or similar expressions. We wish to caution readers that all forward-looking statements are necessarily speculative and not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and to advise readers that actual results could vary due to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements. 

References to Taitron, the Company, we, our and us refer to Taitron Components Incorporated and its wholly owned divisions, unless the context otherwise requires. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Use of Estimates - Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer. Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns. Sales returns for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0. The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 aggregated 7,000. 

Inventory Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) and net realizable value. We had inventory balances in the amount of 2,998,000 and 2,597,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of 5,149,000 and 5,141,000, respectively. We evaluate inventories to identify excess, high-cost, slow-moving or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins. Due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories. If our assumptions about future demand change, or market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs of inventories may be required. In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated. 

Deferred Taxes If determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, which allowance will be charged to income tax expense in the period of such determination. We also consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and future taxable income in assessing if deferred tax assets could be realized. We also consider the weight of both positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance is needed.

Overview 

We are primarily focused on supplying ODM products for our OEM customer s multi-year turn-key projects. We also distribute discrete semiconductors, commodity Integrated Circuits (ICs), optoelectronic devices and passive components to other electronic distributors, CEMs and OEMs, who incorporate them in their products. 

Our core strategy has shifted to primarily focus on higher margin ODM Projects that require custom products designed for specific applications to OEM customers, and away from actively marketing our superstore strategy of maintaining a vast quantity of electronic components to fill customer orders immediately from available stock held in inventory. As a result, we expect our components inventory will be more passively marketed and distributed online for clearance through our internet sales portal, however at potentially lower rates due to the pricing pressures normally attributed with online shopping. 

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our September 30, 2024, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 22 of current assets and 16 of total assets. However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash. We cannot assure you that demand in the discrete semiconductor market will increase and that market conditions will improve. Therefore, it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result. 

Our gross profit margins are subject to a number of factors, including product demand, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, provisions for inventory reserves, our ability to purchase inventory at favorable prices and our sales product mix. 

Results of Operations 

Significant Risks and Uncertainties 

See the Risk Factors included in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the additional Risk Factor included in Part II Item 1A of this quarterly report. 

Third quarter of 2024 versus 2023. 

Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 totaled 1,187,000 versus 1,563,000 in the comparable period for 2023, a decrease of 376,000 or 24.1 over the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM components sales volume. 

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 552,000 versus 918,000 in the comparable period for 2023, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 46.5 in the third quarter of 2024 versus 58.7 in the comparable period for 2023. The approximately 12.2 gross margin percentage decrease was driven by selling lower margin products. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024 totaled 530,000 versus 530,000 in the comparable period for 2023. 

Other income, net, in the third quarter of 2024 was 163,000 versus 13,000 in the comparable period for 2023. Other income was primarily from unrealized capital appreciation of short-term investments. 

Income tax provision was 8,000 for the third quarter of 2024 versus 62,000 in the comparable period for 2023. 

Net income was 245,000 for the third quarter of 2024 versus 411,000 in the comparable period for 2023, a decrease of 166,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.

Index 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 . 

Net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,374,000 versus 5,139,000 in the comparable period for 2023, a decrease of 1,765,000 or 34.3 over the same period last year. The decrease was driven by a decrease of ODM project and ODM components sales volume. 

Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,710,000 versus 2,917,000 in the comparable period for 2023, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 50.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 56.8 for 2023, respectively. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1,683,000 versus 1,703,000 in the comparable period for 2023, a decrease of 20,000 over the same period last year. The 20,000 decrease was primarily driven by lower salaries and personnel related costs. 

Other income, net, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 976,000 versus 494,000 in the comparable period for 2023. Other income was primarily from unrealized capital appreciation of short-term investments. 

Income tax provision was 23,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 143,000 in the comparable period for 2023. 

Net income was 1,203,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 1,704,000 in the comparable period for 2023, a decrease of 501,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We historically have satisfied our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term commercial loans, subordinated related party promissory notes and issuance of equity securities. 

Cash flows used in operating activities were 374,000) as opposed to provided by of 2,024,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 2,398,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from accounts payable and inventory. 

Cash flows used for investing activities were 228,000 and 1,204,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Cash flows used for financing activities were 903,000 and 845,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

We believe that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances, short term investments and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities. Otherwise, we may need to liquidate assets to generate the necessary working capital. 

Inventory is included and classified as a current asset. As of September 30, 2024, inventory represented approximately 22 of current assets and 16 of total assets. However, it is likely to take over one (1) year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not saleable within this time frame. Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
