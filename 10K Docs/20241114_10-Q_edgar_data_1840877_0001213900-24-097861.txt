Contingent
Sponsor Shares 

Pursuant
to the Sponsor Support Agreement, shares of Common Stock held by the Sponsor shall be unvested and subject to the restrictions
and forfeiture provisions set forth in the Sponsor Support Agreement (the Contingent Sponsor Shares ). The Contingent Sponsor
Shares shall vest upon the FDA s approval of the Acclaim CI (the FDA Approval ). If a change of control of the Company
shall occur following the Closing, then the conditions for vesting of any Contingent Sponsor Shares that remain unvested as of immediately
prior to the consummation of the change of control shall be deemed to have been achieved and such Contingent Sponsor Shares shall immediately
vest as of immediately prior to the consummation of such change of control. 

The
Contingent Sponsor Shares meets the definition of a derivative, but meets the criteria to be considered indexed to the Company s
stock and the equity-classification criteria. Accordingly, the Contingent Sponsor Shares are classified as permanent equity. 

Common
Stock Warrants (Related Party) 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of its Common Stock to a related party
in conjunction with the 2024 Term Loans (see Note 9). These warrants are all outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 

Forward
Purchase Agreement 

The
Company previously issued to Meteora warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase
Agreement (the Shortfall Warrants ). As issued, the Shortfall Warrants had an exercise price determined based on the volume
weighted average price of the Common Stock, subject to a price floor (the Exercise Price Floor ), which Exercise Price
Floor is adjustable for certain issuances of its Common Stock at a price below the then-current Exercise Price Floor. The Shortfall Warrants
had an expiration date of June 30, 2024. On June 24, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Forward Purchase Agreement to
extend the expiration date by six months, from June 30, 2024 to December 31, 2024. On July 29, 2024, the Company entered into an
amendment to the Forward Purchase Agreement to reduce the Exercise Price Floor to with respect to of the Shortfall Warrants
and for an additional Shortfall Warrants, with the Exercise Price Floor remaining at for the remainder of the Shortfall
Warrants. The Company concluded that the amendments were made to induce holders to exercise the warrants and, as such, the incremental
change in fair value as a result of the amendment to the Forward Purchase Agreement was and was accounted for as an equity issuance
cost to additional paid-in capital. 

On
various dates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, Shortfall Warrants were exercised for shares of Common
Stock, generating gross proceeds of approximately . As of September 30, 2024, Shortfall Warrants remained outstanding.

Overview 

We
are a hearing health company focused on providing innovative medical technologies across the hearing loss spectrum. Our technologies
are designed to shift the paradigm within the hearing industry and bring both providers and patients the hearing devices they desire.
Founded in 1995, our vision is to create fully implanted hearing devices that leverage the natural ear not an artificial microphone
 to pick up sound. In recent years, we have focused almost exclusively on developing the fully implanted Acclaim cochlear
implant (the Acclaim CI ), our lead product candidate. 

We
believe that the Acclaim CI is a first-of-its-kind cochlear implant. Our fully implanted technology includes a sensor designed to leverage
the natural anatomy of the ear instead of a microphone to capture sound. The Acclaim CI is designed to address severe to profound sensorineural
hearing loss that is not adequately addressed by hearing aids. The Acclaim CI will only be indicated for adults who have been deemed
adequate candidates by a qualified physician. The Acclaim CI received the Breakthrough Device Designation from the United States Food
and Drug Administration (the FDA in 2019. 

Our
first product, the Esteem Fully Implanted Active Middle Ear Implant Esteem FI-AMEI ), was created and received FDA
approval in 2010. The Esteem FI-AMEI is a fully implanted active middle ear hearing device and remains the only FDA approved fully implanted
hearing device in the US market. Unfortunately, the Esteem FI-AMEI failed to gain commercial traction, primarily due to a lack of reimbursement
or insurance coverage from third-party payors. Despite commercial challenges, approximately 1,000 Esteem FI-AMEI devices were implanted.
Some devices were implanted in the early 2000s during clinical trials, providing Envoy Medical with nearly two decades of experience
with its implantable sensor technology. Throughout our experience, our sensor technology proved a viable alternative and robust option
to external or implanted microphones. 

In
late 2015, we made the decision to shift our focus from the Esteem FI-AMEI to a new product that would leverage our sensor technology
and incorporate it into a cochlear implant. As a result, we now have the Acclaim CI, a fully implanted cochlear implant. We believe the
Acclaim CI gives us the opportunity to disrupt the existing cochlear implant market. The cochlear implant market is one that already
has established market acceptance and reimbursement pathways. In the United States, before we can market a new Class III medical device,
which the Acclaim CI is, we must first receive FDA approval via the premarket application approval process. 

In
October 2024, we received FDA approval of our application for an Investigational Device Exemption IDE for the Acclaim
CI. The IDE application was approved for a staged clinical trial to begin. The staged trial will allow 10 participants to be implanted
before expanding the study to the full cohort. Institutional Site s Investigational Review Board IRB approvals
are needed before participants can be enrolled and implants can begin. IRB approvals can take several months. At the end of the study,
a Premarket Approval PMA application will be submitted to the FDA. It is likely that a panel review will be requested
due to the novel nature of the Acclaim CI. As a result, we currently anticipate obtaining the FDA s decision on our PMA in 2027.
The FDA approval process is uncertain, and we cannot guarantee that we will receive FDA approval on that timeline, or at all. 

26 

We
had a net loss of approximately 6.0 million and net income of 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
and net losses of 16.2 million and 25.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and had an accumulated
deficit of 277.5 million and 257.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We have funded our operations
to date primarily through the issuance of equity securities, term debt and convertible debt, and in September 2023, we received 11.7
million in proceeds from the Business Combination (see Note 1 Nature of the Business and Presentation of the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report). During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, we also received 15.0 million proceeds from the 2024 Term Loans (see Note 9, Debt (Related Party) of the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report), approximately 2.1 million from the sale of
shares from our Forward Purchase Agreement, and 0.4 million from the exercise of certain of our Shortfall Warrants. We expect to continue
to incur net losses for the foreseeable future, and expect our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses,
and capital expenditures will continue to increase. In particular, we expect our expenses to increase as we continue our development
of the Acclaim CI and seek the necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidate, as well as hire additional personnel, pay fees
to outside consultants, attorneys and accountants, and incur other increased costs associated with being a public company. In addition,
if and when we seek and obtain regulatory approval to commercialize the Acclaim CI in the United States, we will also incur increased
expenses in connection with commercialization and marketing of such product. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter
and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials, if any, and our expenditures on other research and development activities.
We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, if and as we: 

continue
 our research and development efforts for the Acclaim CI product candidate, including through
 clinical trials; 

seek
 additional regulatory and marketing approvals in jurisdictions outside the United States; 

establish
 a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize our product candidate; 

rely
 on our third-party suppliers and manufacturers to obtain adequate supply of materials and
 components for our products; 

seek
 to identify, assess, acquire, license, and/or develop other product candidates and subsequent
 generations of our current product candidate; 

seek
 to maintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio; 

seek
 to identify, hire, and retain additional skilled personnel; 

create
 additional infrastructure to support our operations as a public company and our product candidate
 development and planned future commercialization efforts; and 

experience
 any delays or encounter issues with respect to any of the above, including, but not limited
 to, failed studies, complex results, safety issues or other regulatory challenges that require
 longer follow-up of existing studies or additional supportive studies in order to pursue
 marketing approval. 

27 

We
expect that our financial performance will fluctuate quarterly and yearly due to the development status of our Acclaim CI implant product
and our efforts to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize the Acclaim CI implant product. 

The
Acclaim CI has not yet been approved for sale. We do not expect to generate any product sales unless and until we successfully complete
development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate. If we obtain regulatory approval for the Acclaim CI, we expect
to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. As a result, until
such time, if ever, that we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt
financings or other capital sources, including collaborations, licenses or similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional
funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed or on favorable terms, if at all. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed
could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies, including our
research and development activities. If we are unable to raise capital, we will need to delay, reduce, or terminate planned activities
to reduce costs. 

Macroeconomic
Conditions 

Our
business and financial performance are impacted by macroeconomic conditions. Global macroeconomic challenges, such as the effects of
the ongoing war between Russian and Ukraine, the Middle East conflict, supply chain constraints, market uncertainty, volatility in exchange
rates, inflationary trends, interest rates, and evolving dynamics in the global trade environment have impacted our business, financial
performance, and our ability to raise capital. 

Furthermore,
a recession or market correction resulting from macroeconomic factors could materially affect our business and the value of our Common
Stock. The occurrence of any such events may lead to reduced disposable income which could adversely affect the number of Esteem FI-AMEI
implants and replacement components sold as a result of customer and patient reluctance to seek treatment due to financial considerations. 

Adverse
macroeconomic conditions, including pandemics or international tensions, could also result in significant disruption of global economic
conditions and consumer trends, as well as a significant disruption in financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which
could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. 

Key
Components of Our Results of Operations 

Revenue 

Currently,
we derive substantially all our revenue from the sale of the Esteem FI-AMEI implants and replacement components to Esteem FI-AMEI implants.
We enter arrangements with patients to provide them with the Esteem FI-AMEI device, personal programmer devices, sound processor/battery
replacements, and/or an optional Care Plan, each of which are outputs of our ordinary activities in exchange for consideration. Revenue
from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of the product to a customer, which occurs at a point in time, when we are
notified the product has been implanted or used by the customer in a surgical procedure. New implantations of the Esteem FI-AMEI are
not expected to be more than a few per year and may be as low as zero. Although we believe it to be unlikely, Esteem FI-AMEI implantations
could potentially increase with favorable reimbursement policy and coverage changes. We will continue our efforts to pursue positive
reimbursement changes for fully implanted active middle ear implants. There will be continued nominal revenue from replacement of sound
processors for patients who need a new battery.

commercialization of our Acclaim CI implant product, we expect that Acclaim CI revenues will more than exceed our Esteem FI-AMEI revenue.
We are targeting FDA approval for the Acclaim CI in 2026. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of the Esteem FI-AMEI implants, including
materials, labor costs for personnel involved in the manufacturing process, distribution-related services, indirect overhead costs, and
charges for excess and obsolete inventory reserves and inventory write-offs. 

We
expect cost of goods sold to increase or decrease in absolute dollars primarily as, and to the extent, our revenue grows or declines,
respectively. 

Operating
Expenses 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses R D consist of costs incurred for our research activities, primarily our discovery efforts
and the development of the Acclaim CI implant product. We also incur R D costs related to continuing to support, and improving upon
where possible, our Esteem FI-AMEI product. We expense R D costs as incurred, which include: 

salaries,
 employee benefits, and other related costs for our personnel engaged in R D functions; 

service
 fees incurred under agreements with independent consultants, including their fees and related
 travel expenses engaged in R D functions; 

costs
 of laboratory testing including supplies and acquiring, developing, and manufacturing study
 materials; and 

facility-related
 expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance
 of facilities and other operating costs. 

Costs
for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information
and data provided to us by our vendors, service providers and our clinical sites. 

Our
R D expenses are currently tracked on a program-by-program basis. The majority of our R D expenses incurred during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were for the development of the Acclaim CI. 

Our
products require human clinical trials to obtain regulatory approval for commercial sales. We cannot determine with certainty the size,
duration, or completion costs of future clinical trials, or if or when they may be completed. Furthermore, we do not know if the clinical
trials will show positive or negative results, or what those results will mean for regulatory approval or commercialization efforts. 

The
duration, costs and timing of future clinical trials and development of our products will depend on a variety of factors, including: 

the
 scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical
 trials and other R D activities; 

Interest
 in or demand for both investigational site and subject enrollment; 

future
 clinical trial results; 

potential
 changes in government regulation; 

potential
 changes in the reimbursement landscape; and 

the
 timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals. 

29 

A
change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our Acclaim CI implant product could mean a significant
change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that implant. If the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require
us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in the enrollment in
any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical
development. 

R D
activities are central to our business model. We expect that our R D expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future
as we initiate clinical trials for the Acclaim CI implant product and prepare the product for possible commercialization, should it gain
regulatory approval(s). If the Acclaim CI implant product enters later stages of clinical trials and ongoing development, the product
will generally incur higher R D expenses than those in earlier stages of research and development, primarily due to simultaneously
running clinical trials while also iterating the product for commercialization and preparing for the needs of commercialization. There
are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of the Acclaim CI implant product or any products we may develop
in the future, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at
this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our
clinical development program and plans. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses 

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and other related costs for personnel in our sales and marketing functions.
Sales and marketing expenses also include certain indirect costs associated with efforts to secure insurance reimbursement of our products.
We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in the foreseeable future as we increase our administrative personnel to support
our continuing growth. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and other related costs for personnel in our executive, operations,
legal, human resources, finance, and administrative functions. Administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent,
consulting, accounting, tax and audit services, travel expenses and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs
and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, technology, and other operating costs. 

We
expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we increase our administrative personnel
to support our continuing growth, our costs of marketing and selling expenses, our costs of expanding our operations and operating as
a public company. These increases will likely include increases related to the hiring of additional personnel and legal, regulatory,
and other fees and services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs
and investor relations costs associated with being a public company. 

Gain
(Loss) from Changes in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable (Related Party) 

We
elected the fair value option for convertible notes payable (related party), and accordingly, convertible notes payable (related party)
are recorded at fair value at each reporting date on the consolidated balance sheets. Gain (loss) from changes in fair value of convertible
notes payable consists of changes in the fair value during each reporting period. Effective September 29, 2023, the convertible notes
(related party) were converted upon completion of the Business Combination. 

Change
in Fair value of the Forward Purchase Agreement Put Option Liability 

We
recognized the forward purchase agreement put option liability at fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to
re-measurement at each balance sheet date, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company s consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive (loss) income during each reporting period. As of September 30, 2024, we no longer had a forward
purchase agreement put option liability. 

Change
in Fair Value of the Forward Purchase Agreement Warrant Liability 

We
recognized the forward purchase agreement warrant liability at fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement
at each balance sheet date, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive (loss) income during each reporting period. 

30 

Change
in Fair Value of the Publicly Traded Warrant Liability 

We
recognized the publicly traded warrant liability at fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement
at each balance sheet date, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive (loss) income during each reporting period. 

Interest
Expense, Related Party 

Interest
expense, related party consists of accrued interest for the 2024 Term Loans held by a related party, as well as amortization of the debt
discount recorded as a result of the warrants issued with the 2024 Term Loans. Amortization of the debt discount is recorded over the
respective terms of the 2024 Term Loans. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other
income (expense) in 2024 consisted of the sale of research and development quality document templates to another company (which is not
part of our normal course of business). Other income (expense) in 2023 consisted of changes in fair value of our related party warrant
liability.

Net
Revenues 

Net
revenues decreased by 24 thousand and decreased by 38 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024
is primarily due to the decrease in the number of battery replacements due to supply chain issues. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold decreased by 2 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023 as a result of decreases in normal operating costs. Cost of goods
sold increased by 30 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
increase is attributable to manufacturing and materials scrap for the Esteem FI-AMEI product of 14 thousand, additional contractors
for manufacturing technicians and quality inspections of 22 thousand, and personnel costs of 23 thousand for additional employees in
manufacturing and quality inspection, and other operating expenses of 4 thousand partially offset by decrease in professional services
for quality testing of 33 thousand. 

Research

R D
expenses increased approximately 907 thousand and 1.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in headcount and contractors
in our engineering and clinical departments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as we increased headcount across
our clinical and cochlear departments in preparation for our pivotal clinical study for the Acclaim CI. This includes increases due to
non-cash stock option compensation of 42 thousand and 109 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses decreased by 5 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023 due to decreases in normal sales and marketing expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, sales and marketing expenses increased by 63 thousand. This increase was primarily due to increased
legal and professional fees to secure insurance reimbursement for the Esteem FI-AMEI product of 275 thousand plus additional sales and
marketing expenses of 6 thousand, offset by a reduction in headcount in that department of 218 thousand. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses increased 665 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to increased professional and legal fees related to public company expenses of 116
thousand, personnel related costs of 179 thousand, directors and officers insurance of 178 thousand, non-cash stock option expenses
of 101 thousand, and other operating costs of 91 thousand, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

General
and administrative expenses increased 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs of 536 thousand, directors and officers insurance of
 532 thousand, non-cash stock option expenses of 293 thousand, travel expenses of 103 thousand, loss on lease modification of 135
thousand, and other operating costs of 73 thousand, and was partially offset by reduced professional and legal fees related to the closing
of the Business Combination in 2023 of 514 thousand, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

32 

Gain
(Loss) From Changes in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable (Related Party) 

The
loss from changes in fair value of convertible notes payable decreased 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
the gain from changes in fair value of convertible notes decreased 13.3 million nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively due to the conversion of the notes payable to common stock as a result of
the completion of our Business Combination during September 2023. 

Change
in Fair Value of Forward Purchase Agreement Put Option Liability 

We
entered into a forward purchase agreement in September 2023 as part of our Business Combination. During the first quarter of 2024, the
shares associated with the forward purchase agreement were sold resulting in a gain of 103 thousand. 

Change
in Fair Value of Forward Purchase Agreement Warrant Liability 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the forward purchase agreement entered
into in September of 2023 as part of our Business Combination increased by 311 thousand compared to the fair value at June 30, 2024.
The increase in value was due to an increase in our stock price as well as a modification to the forward purchase agreement in July of
2024. This increase in value resulted in a loss of 311 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the forward purchase agreement entered
into in September of 2023 as part of our Business Combination increased by 329 thousand, compared to the fair value at December 31,
2023. The increase in value was due to an increase in our stock price as well as a modification to the forward purchase agreement in
July of 2024. These increases in value resulted in a loss of 329 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Change
in Fair Value of Publicly Traded Warrant Liability 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of our publicly traded warrants increased by approximately 426 thousand
and increased by approximately 802 thousand, respectively. The change in fair value is the result of an increase of approximately 0.03
and an increase of 0.06 in the closing share price for those warrants during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as
compared to the fair value at December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Interest
Expense, Related Party 

Interest
expense increased by 264 thousand and 432 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the interest costs associated with our 2024 Term Loans which were
entered into in February 2024 and August 2024. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Our
other income (expense) decreased by 31 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023 and increased by 74 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Other income (expense) in 2024 consisted of the sale of research and development quality document templates to another company (which
is not part of our normal course of business). Other income (expense) in 2023 consisted of changes in fair value of our related party
warrant liability. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Since
our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and continuing operating losses
for the foreseeable future as we advance the clinical development of our products and fund the process of FDA trials. We have funded
our operations to date primarily with proceeds from raising funds from issuing equity securities, convertible notes, a term loan and
proceeds from the Business Combination. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 4.4 million and 4.2 million of
cash, respectively. 

We
proactively manage our access to capital to support liquidity and continued growth. Our sources of capital include sales of the Esteem
FI-AMEI implants and replacement components and issuances of our Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, warrants, convertible debt,
term debt and other financing agreements such as the forward purchase agreement. See Note 1, Nature of the Business and Basis
of Presentation of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

33 

We
may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations,
strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. There can be no assurance that we will
be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable to us. If we are unable
to raise sufficient financing when needed or events or circumstances occur such that we do not meet our strategic plans, we may be required
to reduce certain discretionary spending, be unable to develop new or enhanced production methods, or be unable to fund capital expenditures,
which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to achieve its intended
business objectives. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. To the extent that we raise
additional capital through additional collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have
to relinquish valuable rights to our Acclaim CI implant, future revenue streams, research programs or to grant licenses on terms that
may not be favorable to us. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity or convertible debt offerings, the ownership
interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences
that adversely affect our stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants
limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring
dividends. 

Our
future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section
of our Form 10-K titled, Risk factors Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations .

Cash
Flows Used in Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily used to fund a net loss of approximately
 16.2 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses in aggregate amount of approximately 2.2 million and approximately 0.4 million of cash
outflows from net changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. The change primarily relates to increases in accounts payable,
accounts receivable, and inventories and decreases in other receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, operating lease liability
(related party), accrued expenses, and product warranty liability. We will continue to evaluate our capital requirements for both short-term
and long-term liquidity needs, which could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects
of the current inflationary environment, rising interest rates, and other risks detailed in our Form 10-K titled Risk Factors . 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily used to fund a net loss of approximately
 25.0 million, adjusted for non-cash gains in aggregate amount of approximately 13.4 million, and approximately 5.7 million of cash
outflows from net changes in the level of operating assets and liabilities, primarily related to increases in accounts payable, accrued
expenses, related party payable, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, and inventories and decreases in product warranty liability and
lease liability (related party). 

Cash
Flows Used in Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 1.5 million and consisted of purchases
of property and equipment, specifically equipment used in the production of finished goods. 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 0.1 million and consisted of purchases
of computer equipment due to increased headcount and purchases of lab equipment. 

Cash
Flows Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.3 million. This increase was primarily driven
by the 15.0 million proceeds from the 2024 Term Loans, the receipt of 1.7 million from the sale of common stock associated with the
forward purchase agreement as well as the proceeds from exercise of warrants of 434 thousand, partially offset by dividends paid to
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock of 1.8 million . 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 22.7 million. This increase was primarily driven
by the 11.7 million net proceeds from the PIPE Transaction, Forward Purchase Agreement, and Business Combination and was also driven
by 10.0 million proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes payable to a related party. 

34 

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

Our
principal commitments consist of contractual cash obligations under our borrowings with stockholders, our operating leases for office
space, and various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Our obligations for leases are described in Note 7, Operating
Leases , and further information on our open litigation matters, are described in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies of
the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

During
the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under the rules and regulations
of the SEC. 

Related
Party Arrangements 

Our
related party arrangements consist of leasing our headquarters office space from a stockholder and issuing convertible notes and term
loans from stockholders. We also accrued interest on the term loans to a stockholder on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 2024. For further information on the related party arrangements refer to Note 5 Cash Available for Dividend Payments ,
Note 7 Operating Leases , Note 9 Debt (Related Party) and Note 13 Related Party
Transactions of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 included elsewhere in this Report. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed from those described in our 2023 Form 10-K, under Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates . 

Fair
Value Measurements 

We
determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy established in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ). ASC 820 identifies fair value as the
exchange price, or exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants. The hierarchy describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value,
as follows: 

Level
 1 Observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical
 assets and liabilities. 

Level
 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly
 or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in
 markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
 observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level
 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity
 and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

Management
uses valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of financial instruments, where active market quotes are not available.

The
fair values of the forward purchase agreement warrant liability and the forward purchase agreement put option liability were estimated
using Monte Carlo Simulation models, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. Key estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value
measurement include (i) the Company s stock price, (ii) the initial exercise price, (iii) the remaining term and (iv) the risk-free
rate. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

We
will incur substantial expenses associated with prototyping, improvements, testing and clinical trials. Accounting for clinical trials
relating to activities performed by external vendors requires us to exercise significant estimates regarding the timing and accounting
for these expenses. We estimate costs of R D activities conducted by service providers, which include the conduct of sponsored research
and contract manufacturing activities. The diverse nature of services being provided for our clinical trials and other arrangements,
the different compensation arrangements that exist for each type of service and the lack of timely information related to certain clinical
activities complicates the estimation of accruals for services rendered by third parties in connection with clinical trials. We record
the estimated costs of R D activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced and include these
costs in the accrued expenses or prepaid expenses on the balance sheets and within R D expense on the unaudited consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. In estimating the duration of a clinical study, we evaluate the start-up, treatment and
wrap-up periods, compensation arrangements and services rendered attributable to each clinical trial and fluctuations are regularly tested
against payment plans and trial completion assumptions. 

We
estimate these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and budget provided and in accordance with agreements established
with our collaboration partners and third-party service providers. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued
liabilities and prepaid expense balances in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued liabilities or
prepaid expenses. We have not experienced any material differences between accrued costs and actual costs incurred since our inception. 

Our
expenses related to clinical trials will be based on estimates of patient enrollment and related expenses at clinical investigator sites
as well as estimates for the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions that may
be used to conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. We will accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on contracted amounts
applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity. If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial
protocol or scope of work to be performed, we will modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. 

Product
Warranty 

During
2013, we offered a lifetime warranty to clinical trial patients to cover battery and surgery related costs. We estimate the costs that
may be incurred under this lifetime warranty and record a liability in the amount of such costs at its present value. The assumptions
utilized in developing the liability include an estimated cost per unit of 6 thousand, an average battery life of 5 years, inflationary
increases of 3.7 , discount rate, and an average patient life calculated on probabilities outlined in the PRI-2012 mortality tables,
published from the Society of Actuaries. Additionally, a discount rate of 4.9 was used in the calculation as of September 30, 2024.

Emerging
Growth Company 

Section
102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to
comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act
registration statement declared effective or no not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect
to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such
election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard
is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public and private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can
adopt the new or revised standard at the time the private companies adopt the new or revised standard, until such time we are no longer
considered to be an emerging growth company. At times, we may elect to early adopt a new or revised standard. 

Item 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls
and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
due to the existence of the material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting described below. 

Notwithstanding
the conclusion by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September
30, 2024 were not effective, and notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below,
management believes that the consolidated financial statements and related financial information included in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates presented,
and for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with GAAP. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
previously disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, management concluded the following material
weaknesses existed and such material weaknesses were in the process of being remediated as of September 30, 2024: 

The
 Company does not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with accounting knowledge,
 experience and training to appropriately analyze, record and disclose certain accounting
 matters to provide reasonable assurance of preventing material misstatements. 

The
 Company s management does not implement a formal risk assessment that addresses risks
 relevant to financial reporting objectives, including cybersecurity and fraud risks. 

The
 Company has not designed, documented and maintained formal accounting policies, procedures
 and controls over significant accounts and disclosures to achieve complete, accurate and
 timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including segregation of duties and
 adequate controls related to the preparation, posting, modification and review of journal
 entries. 

37 

The
 Company has not designed and maintained effective controls around the interpretation and
 accounting treatment of the valuation of a material liability and the forward purchase agreement. 

The
 Company has not designed and maintained effective controls over certain information technology
 general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of its consolidated
 financial statements, including ineffective controls around user access and segregation of
 duties. 

Considering
this, we performed additional procedures and analyses as deemed necessary to ensure that its financial statements were prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. 

We
have continued our implementation of a plan to remediate these material weaknesses. These remediation measures are ongoing and include
the following steps: 

hiring
 additional accounting and financial reporting personnel with appropriate technical accounting
 knowledge and public company experience in financial reporting; 

designing
 and implementing effective processes and controls over significant accounts and disclosure; 

designing
 and maintaining effective controls to ensure appropriate accounting for complex technical
 arrangements, such as the Forward Purchase Agreement; 

designing
 and implementing security management and change management controls over information technology
 systems, including adjusting user access levels and implementing external logging on activity
 and periodic review of such logs; and 

reviewing
 candidate accounting advisory firms to assist with the documentation, evaluation, remediation
 and testing of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the
 criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued
 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER
INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal
Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently involved
in any material legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of our business. 

On
November 14, 2023, the Company, Whitney Haring-Smith (the former chief executive officer and a former director of the Company), Daniel
Hirsch (the former chief financial officer of the Company), and Anzu SPAC GP I LLC were named as defendants in a complaint filed by Atlas

Section
3 . Certain Adjustments . 

a) Stock
Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes
a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Shares or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in Common Shares
(which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Common Shares issued by the Company upon exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides
outstanding Common Shares into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding Common
Shares into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification of shares of the Common Shares any shares of capital stock
of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of Common
Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number
of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately
adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a)
shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution
and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

b) Subsequent
Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3(a) above, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells
any rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of Common Shares (the Purchase
Rights ), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase
Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of Warrant Shares acquirable upon complete exercise of this
immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record
is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Shares are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase
Rights. 

c) Pro
Rata Distributions . During such time as this Warrant is outstanding, if the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution
of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Shares, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without
limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification,
corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a Distribution ), at any time after
the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent
that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of Warrant Shares acquirable upon complete exercise
of this Warrant immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date
as of which the record holders of Common Shares are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution. To the extent that this
Warrant has not been partially or completely exercised at the time of such Distribution, such portion of the Distribution shall be held
in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until the Holder has exercised this Warrant. 

A- 3 

d) Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes
of this Section 3, the number of Warrant Shares deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number
of Warrant Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

e) Notice
to Holder . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the Company shall promptly deliver
to the Holder by facsimile or email a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the
number of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

Section
4 . Transfer of Warrant . 

a) Transferability .
With respect to any offer, sale or other disposition of this Warrant, Holder will give written notice to the Company prior thereto, describing
briefly the manner thereof, together with a written opinion of Holder s counsel, or other evidence if reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, to the effect that such offer, sale or other distribution may be effected without registration or qualification (under any
federal or state law then in effect). Upon receiving such written notice and reasonably satisfactory opinion, if so requested, or other
evidence, the Company, as promptly as practicable, shall notify Holder that Holder may transfer this Warrant in accordance with the terms
of the notice delivered to the Company. If a determination has been made pursuant to this Section 4(a) that the opinion of counsel
for Holder, or other evidence, is not reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the Company shall so notify Holder promptly after such determination
has been made. Upon an effective transfer, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee
or assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination or denominations specified in such instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the
assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled. 

b) New
Warrants . This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of the Company,
together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by the Holder or
its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 4(a), as to any transfer which may be involved in such division or combination,
the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided or combined in accordance
with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the initial issuance date of this Warrant and shall be
identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant thereto. 

Section
5 . No Registration; Restricted Shares . Holder acknowledges that this Warrant and the Warrant Shares issuable upon
exercise hereof have not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption
depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the Holder s investment intent as expressed herein. Holder
understands that this Warrant and the Warrant Shares issued upon any exercise hereof must be held indefinitely unless subsequently
registered under the Securities Act and qualified under applicable state securities laws, or unless exemption from such registration
and qualification are otherwise available. Holder is aware of the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities
Act. 

A- 4 

Section 6 . Miscellaneous . 

a) No
Rights as Stockholder Until Exercise; No Settlement in Cash . This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights, dividends
or other rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in Section 2(d)(i), except as expressly set
forth in Section 3. Without limiting any rights of a Holder to receive Warrant Shares to receive cash payments pursuant to Section 2(d)(i)
and Section 2(d)(iv) herein, in no event shall the Company be required to net cash settle an exercise of this Warrant. 

b) Loss,
Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory
to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant Shares, and in case
of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case of the Warrant, shall not include
the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate, if mutilated, the Company will make
and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant or stock certificate. 

c) Saturdays,
Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or granted
herein shall not be a business day, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding business day. 

d) Authorized
Shares . 

The Company
covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Warrant Shares a sufficient
number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company
further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty of issuing
the necessary Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable action
as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation,
or of any requirements of the Trading Market upon which the Warrant Shares may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares
which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented
by this Warrant and payment for such Warrant Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free from all taxes, liens and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any
transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue). 

A- 5 

Except
and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending
its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale
of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant,
but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise
immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company
may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof,
as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform its obligations under this Warrant. 

Before
taking any action which would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the
Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary from
any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof. 

e) Jurisdiction .
All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the Note. 

f) Restrictions .
The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered, will have restrictions
upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws. 

g) Nonwaiver
and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate as
a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers or remedies. Without limiting any other provision of this
Warrant or the Note, if the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant, which results in any material
damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and expenses including,
but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees, including those of appellate proceedings, incurred by the Holder in collecting any
amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder. 

A- 6 

h) Notices .
Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the Company shall be delivered in
accordance with the notice provisions of the Note. 

i) Limitation
of Liability . No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase Warrant
Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the Holder for the purchase
price of any Warrant Shares or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company or by creditors of the
Company. 

j) Remedies .
The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific
performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss
incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert the defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

k) Successors
and Assigns . Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns of Holder.
The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant and shall be enforceable
by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares. 

l) Amendment .
This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and the Holder. 

m) Severability .
Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions of this Warrant. 

n) Headings .
The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed a part of this Warrant.

Promissory Note (the Note ), dated August 27, 2024, among the Company and the purchasers signatory thereto. 

Section
2 . Exercise . 

a)
 Exercise of Warrant . Exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time
or times before the Termination Date by delivery to the Company of a duly executed facsimile copy or PDF copy submitted by e-mail (or

with delivery of the Notice of Exercise, the Holder shall deliver the aggregate Exercise Price for the shares specified in the applicable
Notice of Exercise by wire transfer or cashier s check drawn on a United States bank. Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting
in purchases of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding
number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder and
the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. The Holder and any
assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase

by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share. 

iii.
 Charges, Taxes and Expenses . Issuance of Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax
or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such Warrant Shares, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company,
and such Warrant Shares shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder; provided ,

require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. The Company
shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Exercise and all fees to the Depository Trust Company

Shares (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Common Shares issued by the Company upon exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides
outstanding Common Shares into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding Common

of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of
Common Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the
number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall
be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant
to this Section 3(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive
such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination
or re-classification. 

b)
 Subsequent Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3(a) above, if at any time the Company grants,
issues or sells any rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of Common Shares
(the Purchase Rights ), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights,
the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of Warrant Shares acquirable upon
complete exercise of this immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights,
or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Shares are to be determined for the grant, issue or
sale of such Purchase Rights. 

c)

(including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off,
reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a Distribution ),
at any time after the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution
to the same extent that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of Warrant Shares acquirable upon
complete exercise of this Warrant immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record
is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Shares are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution. To
the extent that this Warrant has not been partially or completely exercised at the time of such Distribution, such portion of the Distribution
shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until the Holder has exercised this Warrant. 

d)

case may be. For purposes of this Section 3, the number of Warrant Shares deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall
be the sum of the number of Warrant Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

2 

e)
 Notice to Holder . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the Company shall promptly
deliver to the Holder by facsimile or email a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment
to the number of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.

 Transferability . With respect to any offer, sale or other disposition of this Warrant, Holder will give written notice to the
Company prior thereto, describing briefly the manner thereof, together with a written opinion of Holder s counsel, or other evidence

or qualification (under any federal or state law then in effect). Upon receiving such written notice and reasonably satisfactory opinion,
if so requested, or other evidence, the Company, as promptly as practicable, shall notify Holder that Holder may transfer this Warrant
in accordance with the terms of the notice delivered to the Company. If a determination has been made pursuant to this Section 4(a)
that the opinion of counsel for Holder, or other evidence, is not reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the Company shall so notify
Holder promptly after such determination has been made. Upon an effective transfer, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant
or Warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination or denominations specified in such instrument
of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant

or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided
or combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the initial issuance date of
this Warrant and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant thereto. 

Section
5 . No Registration; Restricted Shares . Holder acknowledges that this Warrant and the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise
hereof have not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon,
among other things, the bona fide nature of the Holder s investment intent as expressed herein. Holder understands that this Warrant
and the Warrant Shares issued upon any exercise hereof must be held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the Securities
Act and qualified under applicable state securities laws, or unless exemption from such registration and qualification are otherwise

the duty of issuing the necessary Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all

Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary from
any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof. 

e)
 Jurisdiction . All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined

have restrictions upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws. 

g)
 Nonwaiver and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall
operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers or remedies. Without limiting any other provision
of this Warrant or the Note, if the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant, which results
in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and
expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees, including those of appellate proceedings, incurred by the Holder
in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder.
