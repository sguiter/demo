 The effective tax rate for the third quarter and the first three quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflects the impact of the previously recorded valuation allowance. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, the Company does not anticipate material income tax expense or benefit as a result of the valuation allowance recorded. The Company will maintain the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support a full or partial reversal. The reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance will generally result in a benefit from income tax.

 _____________________________ 

Impairment is based on management s current assessment of the expected future cash flows of a restaurant based on recent results and other specific market factors. Impairment expense is a Level 3 fair value measure and is determined by comparing the carrying value of restaurant assets to the estimated fair value of the rest aurant assets at resale value, if any, and the right-of-use asset based on a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing market lease rates. 
 
 restaurants were identified as impaired during the third quarter of 2024. In the first three quarters of 2024, restaurants were impaired. Additionally, the Company wrote down lease related assets on restaurant during the third quarter of 2024 and restaurants during the first three quarters of 2024. The impairment of these fixed assets and lease related assets were based on the review of underperforming restaurants that the Company would seek to close on or before their next lease renewal dates and are unlikely to recover the net book value of their assets. 
 
 The Company did identify any restaurant impairments in the third quarter of 2023 and had restaurant impaired during the first three quarters of 2023. The Company also wrote down the lease related assets on previously closed restaurants in the third quarter of 2023 and had a total of restaurant lease related assets written down during the first three quarters of 2023. All periods include ongoing equipment costs for restaurants previously impaired. 
 
 The Company closed restaurants in the third quarter of 2024 and had restaurant closures during the first three quarters of 2024. Closure costs in the third quarter and the first three quarters of 2024 included million and million of estimated early lease termination settlements, partially offset by gains from the related lease asset remeasurements, on and restaurants, respectively. Both periods include ongoing expenses from restaurant closures in prior years. 
 
 The Company did close any restaurants during the third quarter of 2023 and had restaurant closures in first three quarters of 2023. Closure costs in the third quarter of 2023 primarily included ongoing expenses from restaurant closures in prior periods. Closure costs during the first three quarters of 2023 included million early lease termination settlements, net of gains from the related lease remeasurements, plus ongoing expenses from restaurant closures in prior years.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Noodles Company is a Delaware corporation that was organized in 2002. Noodles Company and its subsidiaries are sometimes referred to as we, us, our and the Company in this report. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1 and with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended January 2, 2024. We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Tuesday closest to December 31. Our fiscal quarters each contain 13 operating weeks, with the exception of the fourth quarter of a 53-week fiscal year, which contains 14 operating weeks. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 contain 52 weeks. 
 
 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties such as the number of restaurants we intend to open, projected capital expenditures and estimates of our effective tax rates. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, might, will, objective, intend, should, could, can, would, expect, believe, design, estimate, predict, potential, plan or the negative of these terms and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on currently available operating, financial and competitive information. Examples of forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts, such as statements regarding expectations with respect to unit growth and planned restaurant openings and projected capital expenditures . Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements due to reasons including, but not limited to, our ability to sustain our overall growth, including, our digital sales growth; o ur ability to open new restaurants on schedule and cause those newly opened restaurants to be successful; our ability to achieve and maintain increases in comparable restaurant sales and to successfully execute our business strategy, including new restaurant initiatives and operational strategies to improve the performance of our restaurant portfolio; the success of our marketing efforts, including our ability to introduce new products; economic conditions, including inflation, an economic recess ion or an elevated interest rate environment; price and availability of commodities and other supply chain challenges; our ability to adequately staff our restaurants; changes in labor costs; other conditions beyond our control such as domestic or global conflicts, wars, terrorist activity, weather, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics impacting our customers or food supplies; and consumer reaction to industry related public health issues and health pandemics, including perceptions of food safety and those discussed in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors as filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended January 2, 2024. 
 
 Recent Trends, Risks and Uncertainties 
 
 Revenue. In the third quarter we saw a decline in system-wide comparable restaurant sales, and correspondingly in total revenue. System-wide comparable restaurant sales decreased 3.3 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, comprised of a 3.4 decrease at company-owned restaurants and a 2.9 decrease at franchise-owned restaurants. 
 
 Restaurant industry sales remain volatile with elevated levels of discounting targeting increasingly price-sensitive consumers. Our sales have been impacted by the challenging consumer environment and we have responded with added promotional support late in the third quarter and extending into the fourth quarter of 2024. Our sales deceleration in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2024 was also impacted by a decline in our third-party delivery channel. The consumer environment has caused many companies in the restaurant industry to report a decreased level of same store sales in 2024, and our sales trends have followed. We are focusing on revitalizing our menu options starting late in the third quarter and continuing in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025 as the new menu is introduced nationally. 
 
 Co st of Sales. The commodity markets underlying our cost of food have improved since the historically high costs in 2022. Our commodity inflation in the third quarter of 2024 was less than 2 . Throughout periods of volatility, we will continue to work with our suppliers to identify ongoing supply chain efficiencies, including adding additional suppliers as necessary.

 Labor Costs. Similar to much of the restaurant industry, our base labor costs have risen in recent years. In 2024, we have seen the rate of wage inflation decrease. We have been able to partially mitigate the impact of these market factors through a continued focus on maximizing efficiencies of labor hour usage per restaurant. 
 
 Other Restaurant Operating Costs. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur third-party delivery fees resulting from significant usage of third-party delivery services. 
 
 Restaurant Development. In the first three quarters of 2024, we opened ten new company-owned restaurants and two new franchise restaurants, and we sold six company-owned restaurants to a franchisee (the DND Sale ). As part of the DND Sale, we entered into a six-year development plan commitment that includes development of ten new locations throughout Oregon and Washington. As of October 1, 2024, we had 377 company-owned restaurants and 94 franchise restaurants in 31 states. In 2025, we expect to open two new company-owned restaurants. 
 
 Impairments and Certain Restaurant Closures. In the second quarter of 2024, we performed a review of underperforming restaurants. Through this review, we identified a group of restaurants that we will seek to close on or before their next lease renewal dates, and are unlikely to recover the net book value of their assets. As a result, we impaired twelve restaurants in the second quarter of 2024. We permanently closed seven company-owned restaurants in the first three quarters of 2024. We had four franchise restaurants close in the first three quarters of 2024. We continue to evaluate our portfolio of restaurants, which will likely result in more closures over the next twelve months. In 2024, we expect to close a total of 10 to 15 company-owned restaurants. 

Key Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Performance 
 
 To evaluate the performance of our business, we utilize a variety of financial and performance measures. These key measures include revenue, comparable restaurant sales, average unit volumes AUVs ), restaurant contribution, restaurant contribution margin, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Restaurant contribution, restaurant contribution margin, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Revenue 
 
 Revenue includes both restaurant revenue and franchise royalties and fees. Restaurant revenue represents sales of food and beverages in company-owned restaurants. Several factors affect our restaurant revenue in any period, including the number of restaurants in operation and per-restaurant sales. Franchise royalties and fees represent royalty income and initial franchise fees. While we expect that the majority of our revenue and net income growth will be driven by company-owned restaurants, our franchise restaurants remain an important factor impacting our revenue and financial performance. 
 
 Seasonal factors cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue per restaurant is typically lower in the first and fourth quarters, due to reduced winter and holiday traffic, and is typically higher in the second and third quarters. As a result of these fact ors, our quarterly operating results and restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly. 
 
 Comparable Restaurant Sales 
 
 Comparable restaurant sales refer to year-over-year sales comparisons for the comparable restaurant base. We define the comparable restaurant base to include restaurants open for at least 18 full periods. This measure highlights the performance of existing restaurants, as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded. Changes in comparable restaurant sales are generated by changes in traffic, which we calculate as the number of entr es sold, and changes in per-person spend, calculated as sales divided by traffic. Per-person spend can be influenced by changes in menu prices and the mix and number of items sold per person. Restaurants that were temporarily closed or operating at reduced hours remained in comparable restaurant sales. 
 
 Measuring our comparable restaurant sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our existing restaurant base. Various factors impact comparable restaurant sales, including: 
 
 consumer recognition of our brand and our ability to respond to changing consumer preferences; 
 
 overall economic trends, particularly those that impact consumer financial health and spending; 
 
 our ability to operate restaurants effectively and efficiently to meet consumer expectations; 
 
 pricing;

 the impact of health pandemics; 
 
 local and national competition; 
 
 trade area dynamics; 
 
 introduction of new and seasonal menu items and limited time offerings; and 
 
 opening and closing restaurants in the vicinity of other restaurant locations. 
 
 Consistent with common industry practice, we present comparable restaurant sales on a calendar-adjusted basis that aligns current year sales weeks with comparable periods in the prior year, regardless of whether they belong to the same fiscal period or not. Since opening new company-owned and franchise restaurants is a part of our long-term growth strategy and we anticipate new restaurants will be a component of our long-term revenue growth, comparable restaurant sales is only one measure of how we evaluate our performance. 
 
 Average Unit Volumes 
 
 AUVs consist of the average annualized sales of all company-owned restaurants for a given time period. AUVs are calculated by dividing restaurant revenue by the number of operating days within each time period and multiplying by the number of operating days we have in a typical year. Based on this calculation, temporarily closed restaurants are excluded from the definition of AUV, however, restaurants with temporarily reduced operating hours are included. This measurement allows management to assess changes in consumer traffic and per person spending patterns at our restaurants. In addition to the factors that impact comparable restaurant sales, AUVs can be further impacted by effective real estate site selection and maturity and trends within new markets. 
 
 Restaurant Contribution and Restaurant Contribution Margin 
 
 Restaurant contribution represents restaurant revenue less restaurant operating costs which are cost of sales, labor, occupancy and other restaurant operating costs. Restaurant contribution margin represents restaurant contribution as a percentage of restaurant revenue. We expect restaurant contribution to increase in proportion to the number of new restaurants we open, our comparable restaurant sales growth and cost reduction initiatives. 
 
 We believe that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for investors and other interested parties because they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency and performance. We also use restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, restaurant performance across periods and restaurant financial performance compared with competitors. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of the operating performance of our restaurants and are not reflective of the underlying performance of our business because corporate-level expenses are excluded from these measures. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restaurant impairments, loss on disposal of assets, net lease exit costs (benefits), (gain) loss on sale of restaurants, severance and executive transition costs and stock-based compensation.

 We believe that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide clear pictures of our operating results by eliminating certain non-recurring and non-cash expenses that may vary widely from period to period and are not reflective of the underlying business performance. 
 
 The presentati on of restaurant contribution, restaurant contribution margin, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, which may not be comparable to similarly titled financial measures used by other companies, is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or to be superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that they provide useful information to management and investors about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.

 Third Quarter Ended October 1, 2024 Compared to Third Quarter Ended October 3, 2023 
 
 The table below presents our unaudited operating results for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, and the related quarter-over-quarter changes.

 Revenue 
 
 Total revenue decreased 5.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, or 4.0 , to 122.8 million, compared to 127.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to same store sales decreasing, restaurant closures and the refranchising of six company-owned restaurants in the Oregon market with the DND Sale, partially offset by new restaurant openings since the third quarter of 2023. System-wide comparable restaurant sales decreased 3.3 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, comprised of a 3.4 decrease at company-owned restaurants and a 2.9 decrease at franchise-owned restaurants. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales decreased by 0.8 million, or 2.5 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. As a percentage of restaurant revenue, cost of sales increased to 25.5 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 25.1 in third quarter of 2023 primarily due to the impacts from inflation and menu mix shift, partially offset by a benefit from an increase in menu prices. 
 
 Labor Costs 
 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 Labor costs decreased by 0.7 million, or 1.8 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. As a percentage of restaurant revenue, labor cost increased to 32.0 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 31.3 in the third quarter of 2023 due to sales deleverage and wage inflation, partially offset by an increase in menu prices and lower incentive compensation and benefits. 
 
 Occupancy Costs 
 
 Occupancy costs remained flat in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of restaurant revenue, occupancy costs increased to 9.6 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 9.2 in the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to sales deleverage. 
 
 Other Restaurant Operating Costs 
 
 Other restaurant operating costs increased by 1.6 million, or 6.9 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of restaurant revenue, other restaurant operating costs increased to 20.1 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 18.0 in the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to sales deleverage, and increases in marketing expenses and third-party delivery fees . 
 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 
 General and administrative expense increased by 1.0 million, or 8.7 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to costs from the Company s bi-annual national summit, and an increase in expenses as a result of obsolete warehouse inventory related to menu transformation. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense increased to 10.5 in the third quarter of 2024 from 9.3 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased by 0.6 million, or 9.4 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to new asset additions for restaurants opened and information technology additions, partially offset by restaurant closures since the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Restaurant Impairments, Closure Costs and Asset Disposals 
 
 Restaurant impairments, closure costs and asset disposals increased 0.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase was largely due to an increase in impairment charges related to leased assets. There were no restaurants impaired during either the third quarter of 2024 or the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 
 Interest expense, net increased 0.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to higher average debt balances and higher interest rates in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 and for the third quarter of 2023 reflect the impact of the previously recorded valuation allowance. The primary components of the provision for income tax (for both quarters) are related to state tax and the change in our valuation allowance. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we do not anticipate material income tax expense or benefit as a result of the valuation allowance recorded. We will maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support a full or partial reversal. The reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance will generally result in a benefit from income tax.

Three Quarters Ended October 1, 2024 Compared to Three Quarters Ended October 3, 2023 
 
 The table below presents our unaudited operating results for the first three quarters of 2024 and 2023, and the related period-over-period changes.

 Revenue 
 
 Total revenue decreased by 7.6 million , or 2.0 , in the first three quarters of 2024, to 371.5 million compared to 379.1 million in the same period of 2023. This decrease was primarily due a decline in comparable restaurant sales, restaurant closures and the refranchising of six company-owned restaurants in the Oregon market as part of the DND Sale, partially offset by an increase in restaurant openings since the third quarter of 2023. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 2.3 system-wide in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the first three quarters of 2023 comprised of a 2.6 decrease at company-owned restaurants and 1.0 decrease at franchise-owned restaurants. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales decreased by 2.0 million, or 2.1 , in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. As a percentage of restaurant revenue, cost of sales remained flat at 25.1 in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the first three quarters of 2023 primarily due to a benefit from an increase in menu prices, offset by inflation and menu mix shift. 
 
 Labor Costs 
 22 

Table of Contents 

Labor costs decreased by 2.8 million, or 2.4 , in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. As a percentage of restaurant revenue, labor costs decreased to 31.8 in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to 32.0 in the first three quarters of 2023 primarily due to benefits from hourly labor efficiency and lower incentive compensation and benefits, partially offset by wage inflation and sales deleverage. 
 
 Occupancy Costs 
 
 Occupancy costs increased by 0.6 million, or 1.8 , in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the first three quarters of 2023. As a percentage of restaurant revenue, occupancy costs increased to 9.6 in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to 9.3 in the first three quarters of 2023 primarily due to sales deleverage. 
 
 Other Restaurant Operating Costs 
 
 Other restaurant operat ing costs increased by 2.4 million, or 3.4 , in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the first three quarters of 2023. As a percentage of restaurant revenue, other restaurant operating costs increased to 19.7 in the first three quarters of 2024, compared to 18.7 in the first three quarters of 2023, primarily due to sales deleverage and increases in delivery fees and marketing expenses. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 
 General and administrative expense increased by 1.5 million, or 4.0 , in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the first three quarters of 2023 , primarily due to costs from the Company s bi-annual national summit, increases in marketing spend and executive transition costs, partially offset by a decline in employee related labor costs. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense increased to 10.6 in the first three quarters of 2024 from 10.0 in the first three quarters of 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased by 2.7 million, or 13.8 , in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the first three quarters of 2023 , primarily due to new asset additions for new restaurant openings and information technology, partially offset by restaurant closures. 
 
 Restaurant Impairments, Closure Costs and Asset Disposals 
 
 Restaurant impairments, closure costs and asset disposals increased by 10.2 million in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the first three quarters of 2023. The increase was largely due to an increase in fixed asset impairment charges with twelve restaurants impaired in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to one restaurant impaired in the first three quarters of 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, we performed a review of underperforming restaurants. Through this review, we identified a group of restaurants that we will seek to close on or before their next lease renewal dates, and are unlikely to recover the net book value of their assets. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense increased by 2.9 million in the first three quarters of 2024 compare d to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings and higher interest rates in the first three quarters of 2024 compare d to the first three quarters of 2023. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The effective tax rate for the first three quarters of 2024 and for the first three quarters of 2023 reflect the impact of the previously recorded valuation allowance. The primary components of the provision for income tax (for both quarters) are related to state tax and the change in our valuation allowance. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we do not anticipate material income tax expense or benefit as a result of the valuation allowance recorded. We will maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support a full or partial reversal. The reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance will generally result in a benefit from income tax. We estimate the annual effective tax rate for 2024 to be between (1.0 and (0 ).

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 We have historically used cash and our revolving credit facility to fund capital expenditures for new restaurant openings, reinvest in our existing restaurants, invest in infrastructure and information technology and maintain working capital. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day, or in the case of credit or debit card transactions, within several days of the related sale, and we typically have up to 30 days to pay our vendors. 
 
 We believe that we will be in compliance with our debt covenants and have sufficient sources of cash to meet our liquidity needs and capital resource requirements for at least the next twelve months, through currently available cash and cash equivalents, availability under our revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations. 
 
 Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are shown in the following table (in thousands): 
 Three Fiscal Quarters Ended October 1, 2024 October 3, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 17,545 27,331 Net cash used in investing activities (22,921) (36,622) Net cash provided by financing activities 5,671 10,298 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 295 1,007 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 17.5 million in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 27.3 million in the first three quarters of 2023. The decrease in operating cash flow resulted primarily from a decrease in net income as adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and impairments, as well as changes in working capital related to the timing of accounts payable, payroll and accrued liabilities. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased 13.7 million to 22.9 million in the first three quarters of 2024 from 36.6 million in the first three quarters of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to decreased spend for new restaurants and restaurant technology and proceeds from refranchising transactions. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 5.7 million in the first three quarters of 2024, compared to 10.3 million in the first three quarters of 2023. The decrease from the first three quarters of 2023 was primarily due to a reduction in net borrowings to fund capital spending in 2024, partially offset by repurchases of common stock in the first three quarters of 2023. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 Material Cash Requirements. Our short-term obligations consist primarily of certain lease and other contractual commitments related to our operations, normal recurring operating expenses, working capital needs, new store development, capital improvements and maintenance of our restaurants, regular interest payments on our debt obligations and certain non-recurring expenditures. 
 
 Our long-term obligations consist primarily of certain lease and other contractual commitments related to our operations and payment of our outstanding debt obligations. We are obligated under non-cancelable leases for our restaurants, administrative offices and equipment. In addition, o ur target for new store development will require capital each year which is expected to be funded by currently available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility. Our capital expenditure requirements are primarily dependent upon the pace of our real estate development program and resulting new restaurant openings, costs for maintenance and remodeling of our existing restaurants as well as information technology expenses and other general corporate capital expenditures. 
 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 We estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 29.0 million to 31.0 million for fiscal year 2024, including 4.0 million to 6.0 million for the remainder of the year, primarily for the opening of company-owned restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements, reinvestment in existing restaurants and investments in technology. We expect such capital expenditures to be funded by currently available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and if necessary, undrawn capacity under our revolving credit line. 
 
 Current Resources. Our operations have not historically required significant working capital and, like many restaurant companies, we operate with negative working capital. Restaurant sales are primarily paid for in cash or by credit or debit card, and restaurant operations do not require significant inventories or receivables. In addition, we receive trade credit for the purchase of food, beverages and supplies, therefore reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth. 
 
 Liquidity . As of October 1, 2024 , we had a cash balance of 3.3 million compared to 3.0 million as of January 2, 2024. The amount available for future borrowings under our A R Credit Agreement (defined below) was 32.1 million as of October 1, 2024. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, the expected cash flows from company-owned restaurant operations, the expected franchise fees and royalties and available borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for working capital needs, new restaurant openings, and capital improvements and maintenance of existing restaurants for at least the next twelve months. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 
 On July 27, 2022, we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as further amended, restated, extended, supplemented, modified and otherwise in effect from time to time, the A R Credit Agreement ), with each other Loan Party (as defined in the A R Credit Agreement) party thereto, each lender from time to time party thereto, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender (each as defined in the A R Credit Agreement). The A R Credit Agreement matures on July 27, 2027. Among other things, the A R Credit Agreement: (i) increased the credit facility from 100.0 million to 125.0 million; (ii) eliminated the term loan and principal amortization components of the credit facility; (iii) removed the capital expenditure covenant; (iv) enhanced flexibility for certain covenants and restrictions; and (v) lowered the spread of our cost of borrowing and transitioned from LIBOR to SOFR plus a margin of 1.50 to 2.50 per annum, based upon the consolidated total lease-adjusted leverage ratio.

 amended the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the A R Credit Agreement) in Section 7.11(b) of the Credit Agreement to be no less than (x) 1.05 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending on October 1, 2024 until and including the last day of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2025 and (y) stepping up to (1) 1.15 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending December 30, 2025 and March 31, 2026 and (2) 1.25 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2026 and thereafter. 
 As of October 1, 2024, we had 89.9 million of indebtedness (excluding 1.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs) and 3.0 million of letters of credit outstanding under our A R Credit Agreement. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We had no off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations as of October 1, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2024. Critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. While we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could vary from these assumptions. It is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are identified and described in our annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended January 2, 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on outstanding debt. Our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt, which bears interest at variable rates. As of October 1, 2024, we had 89.9 million of outstanding borrowings under our A R Credit Agreement, with an average interest rate during the first three quarters of 2024 of 8.67 , compa red to 8.0 duri ng the three quarters of 2023, driven by an increase in market base rates. An increase or decrease of 1.0 in the effective interest rate applied on these loans would have resulted in a pre-tax interest expe nse fluctuation of approximately 0.9 million on an annualized basis. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We purchase certain products that are affected by commodity prices and are, therefore, subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions and other factors that are not considered predictable or within our control. Although these products are subject to changes in commodity prices, certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements contain risk management techniques designed to minimize price volatility. We use these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. In many cases, we believe we may be able to address material commodity cost increases by adjusting our menu pricing, but multiple price increases over a short period of time may negatively affect customer behavior, as we observed in 2023. I ncreases in commodity prices, without adjustments to our menu prices, have and could continue to increase restaurant operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 The primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food costs, labor costs, energy costs and materials and labor used in the construction of new restaurants. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance and utilities, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. During the first three quarters of 2024, the degree of inflation moderated compared to 2023. We anticipate inflation may affect our results in the near future. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 O ur management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 1, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to dis close in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the quarter ended October 1, 2024, we implemented a new ERP system, which replaced a legacy system where a significant portion of our transactions were originated, processed and, or recorded. We updated our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate related changes in our financial management processes resulting from this implementation. While we believe that this new system will enhance our internal control over financial reporting, there are inherent risks in implementing a new ERP system. Accordingly, we will continue to evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of these controls. 
 
 Except for this system implementation, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are currently not a party to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, reputational harm and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 A description of the risk factors associated with our business is contained in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended January 2, 2024.
