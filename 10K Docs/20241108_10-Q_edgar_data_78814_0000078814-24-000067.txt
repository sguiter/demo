 percent of the Fortune 500. Small businesses to large enterprises, and government entities rely on Pitney Bowes to reduce the complexity of sending mail and parcels. 

In the third quarter of 2024, we entered into a series of transactions designed to facilitate an orderly wind-down of a majority of the Global Ecommerce reporting segment. As a result, certain revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are now reported as discontinued operations in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts of the former Global Ecommerce segment that did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment primarily relate to operations that were dissolved or sold, shared services functions that are expected to wind-down by the end of 2024 and a cross-border services contract. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. For segment reporting purposes, the remaining portion of Global Ecommerce in continuing operations is now reported as "Other." See Note 4 for further information 
 Effective January 1, 2024, we moved the digital delivery services offering from the former Global Ecommerce segment to the SendTech Solutions segment in order to leverage our technology and innovation capabilities to better serve our clients. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current segment presentation. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company identified an error and recorded an out of period adjustment of million to correct the understatement of revenue in prior periods, of which million originated in 2020 and prior. The impact of the adjustment is not material to the consolidated financial statements for any interim or annual periods prior to 2024 and is not expected to be material to the 2024 annual period.

Subsequent to the GEC Sale, the Ecommerce Debtors, at the direction of their own governing bodies, filed petitions to commence Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases and conduct an orderly wind-down of the Ecommerce Debtors (the GEC Chapter 11 Cases ). We refer to the GEC Sale, the GEC Chapter 11 Cases and any associated transactions as the Ecommerce Restructuring . 
 In connection with the GEC Chapter 11 Cases, we entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the RSA with the Ecommerce Debtors. The RSA provides for, among other things, an orderly wind-down of the Ecommerce Debtors, shared services between the Company and the Ecommerce Debtors for a period of time, a global settlement between the Company and the Ecommerce Debtors, and a senior secured, super-priority debtor-in-possession term loan (the DIP Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million. Through September 30, 2024, we provided funding under the DIP Facility of million, which was fully reserved. It appears unlikely that the DIP Facility will be repaid in full. 
 The Company and the Ecommerce Debtors have entered into a master settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement ), which attaches the RSA and the DIP Facility and which contemplates the separation of the relationship and transactions among the Company and its subsidiaries and the Ecommerce Debtors, including the settlement and release of claims the Ecommerce Debtors may have against the Company. The Settlement Agreement is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and there is no assurance that such approval will be granted. 
 Immediately prior to the GEC Sale, we had various intercompany receivables with the Ecommerce Debtors with an aggregate value of million. After the GEC Sale, those intercompany receivables were converted to third-party receivables, for which we have ascribed a fair value of . Subsequent collections, if any, will be recorded when received or collection is assured. 
 We account for the investment in the Ecommerce Debtors using the equity method which requires the initial fair value of the investment to be recorded as an asset. We determined that the fair value of our economic interest in the Ecommerce Debtors was and is therefore not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. While we no longer control the management of the Ecommerce Debtors, we retain an economic equity interest therein; however, such interest is not anticipated to receive any recovery or distribution as part of the Ecommerce Restructuring. We nevertheless remain exposed to the economic risks and continued costs applicable to the Ecommerce Debtors through our investment in the DIP Facility. Hilco anticipates the Ecommerce Restructuring will be substantially completed by the end of 2024.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 We provide an allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience, the nature of our portfolios, adverse situations that may affect a client's ability to pay and current economic conditions and outlook based on reasonable and supportable forecasts. We continually evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and adjust as necessary. The assumptions used in determining an estimate of credit losses are inherently subjective and actual results may differ significantly from estimated reserves. 
 We establish credit approval limits based on the client's credit quality and the type of equipment financed. We cease financing revenue recognition for lease receivables and unsecured loan receivables that are more than days past due. Revenue recognition is resumed when the client's payments reduce the account aging to less than days past due. Finance receivables are written off against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and management deems the account to be uncollectible. We believe that our credit risk is low because of the geographic and industry diversification of our clients and small account balances for most of our clients.

 Credit Quality 
 The extension and management of credit lines to new and existing clients uses a combination of a client's credit score, where available, a detailed manual review of their financial condition and payment history, or an automated process. Once credit is granted, the payment performance of the client is managed through automated collections processes and is supplemented with direct follow up should an account become delinquent. We have robust automated collections and extensive portfolio management processes to ensure that our global strategy is executed, collection resources are allocated and enhanced tools and processes are implemented as needed. 
 Over of our finance receivables are within the North American portfolio. We use a third-party to score the majority of this portfolio on a quarterly basis using a proprietary commercial credit score. The relative scores are determined based on a number of factors, including financial information, payment history, company type and ownership structure. We stratify the credit scores of our clients into low, medium and high-risk accounts. Due to timing and other issues, our entire portfolio may not be scored at period end. We report these amounts as "Not Scored"; however, absence of a score is not indicative of the credit quality of the account. The credit score is used to predict the payment behaviors of our clients and the probability that an account will become greater than 90 days past due during the subsequent 12-month period. 
 Low risk accounts are companies with very good credit scores and a predicted delinquency rate of less than . 
 Medium risk accounts are companies with average to good credit scores and a predicted delinquency rate between and . 
 High risk accounts are companies with poor credit scores, are delinquent or are at risk of becoming delinquent. The predicted delinquency rate would be greater than . 
 We do not use a third-party to score our International portfolio because the cost to do so is prohibitive as there is no single credit score model that covers all countries. Accordingly, the entire International portfolio is reported in the Not Scored category. Most of the International credit applications are small dollar applications (i.e. below thousand) and are subjected to an automated review process. Larger credit applications are manually reviewed, which includes obtaining client financial information, credit reports and other available financial information.

 Foreign Exchange Contracts 
 In the first nine months of 2023, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to minimize the impact on earnings from the revaluation of short-term interest-bearing intercompany loans denominated in a foreign currency. These foreign exchange contracts were not designated as hedging instruments and the revaluation of intercompany loans and the change in fair value of these derivatives were recorded in earnings. The mark-to-market adjustment on these foreign exchange contracts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a loss of million and a loss of million, respectively, and significantly offset the corresponding gain on the revaluation of intercompany loans. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities, accounts receivable, loan receivables, derivative instruments, accounts payable and debt. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, held-to-maturity investment securities, accounts receivable, loans receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value. The fair value of available-for-sale investment securities and derivative instruments are presented above. The fair value of debt is estimated based on recently executed transactions and market price quotations. The inputs used to determine the fair value of debt were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

 In August 2024, we amended the credit agreement that governs our secured revolving credit facility and the term loan due March 2026 (the "Credit Agreement") and the note purchase agreement that governs our million notes due March 2028. The amendments, among other things, permit the Ecommerce Restructuring, funding under the DIP Facility, amend certain covenants, including relief for expenses incurred pursuant to the Ecommerce Restructuring, release the guarantees provided by the Ecommerce Debtors and the liens on the assets of the Ecommerce Debtors and reduce the total aggregate amount of permitted borrowings under the revolving credit facility from million to million. 
 The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants. These covenants require us to maintain, on a quarterly basis, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, both of which are defined and calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.

 Further information about factors that could materially affect us, including our results of operations and financial condition, is contained in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report, as supplemented by Part II, Item 1A in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Recent Developments 
 On August 8, 2024, we entered into a series of transactions designed to facilitate an orderly wind-down of a majority the Company s Global Ecommerce reporting segment. In connection with the wind-down, an affiliate of Hilco Commercial Industrial, LLC Hilco subscribed for 81 of the voting interests in the subsidiary, DRF Logistics, LLC owning a majority of the Global Ecommerce segment s net assets and operations (DRF Logistics, LLC and its subsidiary, DRF LLC, the Ecommerce Debtors for de minimis consideration (the GEC Sale ), with a subsidiary of Pitney Bowes retaining 19 of the voting interests and 100 of the economic interests. Subsequent to the GEC Sale, the Ecommerce Debtors, at the direction of their own governing bodies, filed petitions to commence Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases and conduct an orderly wind down of the Ecommerce Debtors (the GEC Chapter 11 Cases ). We refer to the GEC Sale, the GEC Chapter 11 Cases and any associated transactions as the Ecommerce Restructuring . 
 In connection with the GEC Chapter 11 Cases, we entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the RSA with the Ecommerce Debtors to provide for, among other things, an orderly wind-down of the Ecommerce Debtors, shared services between the Company and the Ecommerce Debtors for a period of time, a global settlement between the Company and the Ecommerce Debtors, and a senior secured, super-priority debtor-in-possession term loan (the DIP Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 47 million. 
 The Company and the Ecommerce Debtors have entered into a master settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement ), which attaches the RSA and the DIP Facility and which contemplates the separation of the relationship and transactions among the Company and its subsidiaries and the Ecommerce Debtors, including the settlement and release of claims the Ecommerce Debtors may have against the Company. The Settlement Agreement is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and there is no assurance that such approval will be granted. 
 As a result of the Ecommerce Restructuring, certain revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are now reported as discontinued operations in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts of the former Global Ecommerce segment that did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment primarily relate to operations that were dissolved or sold, shared services functions that are expected to wind-down by the end of 2024 and a cross-border services contract. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. For segment reporting purposes, the remaining portion of Global Ecommerce in continuing operations is now reported as "Other." See Note 4 for further information 
 Outlook 
 Within SendTech Solutions, mailing-related revenues are expected to decline driven by lower meter populations due to the migration to cloud-based solutions and a higher mix of lease extensions versus new lease sales. We expect this decline to be partially offset by growth in our shipping offerings. The shift to lease extensions versus new lease sales will result in declining equipment sales in the near term; however, the long term impact will be more stable and continued cash flows over the lease term. 
 Within Presort Services, we expect revenue and margin improvements due to higher revenue-per-piece and lower costs driven by the investments made in automation and technology to drive efficiencies and improve productivity. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we approved a worldwide cost reduction initiative (the "2024 Plan") to realize cost reductions and improve efficiencies. Through the third quarter of 2024, total charges under this plan were 61 million, of which 7 million is included in discontinued operations. Exclusive of savings anticipated as a result of the Ecommerce Restructuring, we expect these headcount actions to generate significant annualized savings. We anticipate incurring additional charges in future periods related to further workforce reductions contemplated by the 2024 Plan. Actions under the 2024 Plan are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first half of 2025.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 OVERVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 
 Constant Currency 
 In the tables below, we report the change in revenue on a reported basis and a constant currency basis. Constant currency measures exclude the impact of changes in currency exchange rates from the prior period under comparison. We believe that excluding the impacts of currency exchange rates provides investors with a better understanding of the underlying revenue performance. Constant currency change is calculated by converting the current period non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue using the prior year s exchange rate. 
 Financial Results Summary - Three and Nine Months Ended September 30:

 A 43 million goodwill impairment charge in the prior year related to our former Global Ecommerce reportable segment. 
 SG A expense decreased 14 million compared to the prior year period primarily driven by lower salary expense of 26 million due to savings from the 2023 and 2024 Plans, lower professional and outsourcing fees of 16 million, lower marketing expenses of 2 million and various other expense savings totaling approximately 25 million from cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense of 28 million, incremental CEO and Board transition costs and strategic review costs of 14 million and non-cash foreign currency revaluation losses on intercompany loans of 13 million.

SEGMENT RESULTS 
 Effective January 1, 2024, we moved the digital delivery services offering from the former Global Ecommerce segment to the SendTech Solutions segment in order to leverage our technology and innovation capabilities to better serve our clients. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current segment presentation. 
 Management measures segment profitability and performance by deducting from segment revenue the related costs and expenses attributable to the segment. Segment results exclude interest, taxes, corporate expenses, restructuring charges, goodwill impairment and other items not allocated to a business segment. 
 
 SendTech Solutions 
 SendTech Solutions provides clients with physical and digital shipping and mailing technology solutions and other applications to help simplify and save on the sending, tracking and receiving of letters, parcels and flats, as well as supplies and maintenance services for these offerings.

 SendTech Solutions revenue decreased 14 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period. Support services revenue declined 11 million primarily due to the declining meter population and continuing shift to cloud-enabled products. Equipment sales declined 10 million primarily due to customers opting to extend leases of their existing advanced-technology equipment rather than purchase new equipment. These revenue declines were partially offset by an increase in business services revenue of 8 million primarily driven by growth in our shipping subscriptions, including enterprise subscriptions and growth in

digital delivery services of 3 million due to client mix. 
 Gross margin declined 9 million and gross margin percentage increased slightly to 66.8 from 66.6 compared to the prior year period. Equipment sales gross margin and gross margin percentage decreased compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the decline in revenue. Support services gross margin declined primarily due to the decrease in revenue. Business services gross margin improved due to growth in enterprise shipping subscriptions and growth in digital delivery services. 
 SG A expense declined 13 million, primarily driven by lower employee-related expenses of 6 million due to savings from the 2023 and 2024 Plans, lower credit loss provision of 2 million and overall cost savings initiatives. 
 Adjusted segment EBIT was 104 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 99 million for the prior year period.

 SendTech Solutions revenue decreased 30 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period. Support services revenue declined 29 million primarily due to the declining meter population and continuing shift to cloud-enabled products. Equipment sales declined 22 million primarily due to customers opting to extend leases of their existing advanced-technology equipment rather than purchase new equipment. Supplies revenue declined 3 million primarily driven by a declining meter population. These revenue declines were partially offset by an increase in business services revenue of 25 million primarily driven by growth in our shipping subscriptions, including enterprise subscriptions and growth in digital delivery services of 9 million due to client mix. 
 Gross margin declined 9 million; however, gross margin percentage increased to 66.7 from 65.6 compared to the prior year period. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by improvements in business services gross margin due to growth in enterprise shipping subscriptions and growth in digital delivery services. Gross profit margin for support services, equipment sales and supplies was comparable to the prior year period as we reduced costs in response to lower revenues in the current period. 
 35 

SG A expense declined 24 million, primarily driven by lower employee-related expenses of 14 million due to savings from the 2023 Plan, lower credit loss provision of 2 million and lower expenses driven by overall cost savings initiatives. 
 Adjusted segment EBIT was 306 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 292 million for the prior year period. 
 
 Presort Services 
 Presort Services is the largest workshare partner of the USPS and national outsource provider of mail sortation services that allow clients to qualify large volumes of First Class Mail, Marketing Mail, and Marketing Mail Flats/Bound Printed Matter for postal worksharing discounts.

 Revenue increased 29 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to pricing actions. The processing of First Class Mail and Marketing Mail Flats/Bound Printed Matter contributed revenue increases of 22 million and 8 million, respectively, which was partially offset by a revenue decrease from Marketing Mail of 1 million. Revenue was also favorably impacted by a 5 million adjustment related to prior periods. Refer to Note 1 Basis of Presentation for further information.

Gross margin increased 39 million and gross margin percentage increased from 29.3 in the prior period to 35.7 primarily due to the increase in revenue, lower transportation costs of 4 million driven by improvements in network management and the continuing benefits from investments in automation and higher-throughput sortation equipment. 
 SG A expense increased 2 million primarily due to higher credit loss provision. 
 Adjusted segment EBIT was 114 million in the first nine months of 2024, including the 5 million benefit from the revenue adjustment related to prior periods, compared to 76 million in the prior year period. 

CORPORATE EXPENSES

Operating expenses not recorded directly or allocated to our reportable segments are reported as corporate expenses. Corporate expenses primarily represents corporate administrative functions such as finance, marketing, human resources, legal, information technology, and research and development.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity for our operations is dependent upon a number of factors, including our revenue and earnings, our ability to manage costs and improve productivity, our clients' ability to pay their balances on a timely basis and the impacts of changing macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. At September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 576 million, which includes 46 million held at our foreign subsidiaries used to support their liquidity needs. At this time, we believe that existing cash and investments, cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next 12 months. 
 In August 2024, we amended the Credit Agreement and the note purchase agreement that governs our 275 million notes due March 2028. These amendments, among other things, permit the Ecommerce Restructuring, funding under the DIP Facility, amend certain covenants, including relief for expenses incurred pursuant to the Ecommerce Restructuring, release the guarantees provided by the Ecommerce Debtors and the liens on the assets of the Ecommerce Debtors, and reduce the total aggregate amount of permitted borrowings under the revolving credit facility from 500 million to 400 million. 
 The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain, on a quarterly basis, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, both of which are defined and calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. 
 Management expects that we will remain in compliance with these amended financial covenants over the next twelve months. However, events and circumstances could occur, some beyond our control, that could adversely impact our compliance with these covenants and require us to obtain a waiver from our lenders, modify our existing covenants or refinance certain debt to cure the noncompliance. If we are unable to cure the noncompliance, amounts due under our revolving credit facility and term loan due March 2026 could be accelerated by our lenders. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under our secured debt are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. 
 In connection with the GEC Chapter 11 Cases, the Company, through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, agreed to provide funding to the Ecommerce Debtors through the DIP Facility up to a maximum amount of 47 million. Through September 30, 2024, we provided cash funding of 28 million. It appears unlikely that the DIP Facility will be repaid in full. The DIP Facility bears interest at 10 , and matures on November 29, 2024, unless otherwise extended by the parties. 
 
 Immediately prior to the GEC Sale, we had various intercompany receivables with the Ecommerce Debtors with an aggregate value of 116 million. After the GEC Sale, those intercompany receivables were converted to third-party receivables, for which we have ascribed a fair value of zero. Subsequent collections, if any, will be recorded when received or collection is assured. 
 
 Cash Flow Summary 
 Changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows: 
 2024 2023 Change Net cash from operating activities 94,691 (13,910) 108,601 Net cash from investing activities (66,348) (95,436) 29,088 Net cash from financing activities (68,021) (2,059) (65,962) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1,162 (311) 1,473 Change in cash and cash equivalents (38,516) (111,716) 73,200 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 improved 109 million compared to the prior year period driven primarily by a decline in finance receivables and lower payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash flows from investing activities for the first nine months of 2024 improved 29 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower cash outflows from discontinued operations of 16 million, lower investments in loans receivable of 18 million, higher cash from investment activity of 16 million and lower cash payments from settlements of derivative contracts of 7 million, partially offset by DIP Facility funding of 28 million. 

38 

Financing Activities 
 Cash flows from financing activities for the first nine months of 2024 declined 66 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower cash flows from changes in customer account deposits at the Bank of 73 million, partially offset by lower fees paid to refinance debt of 6 million. 
 We paid dividends of 9 million in the quarter and 27 million through September 30, 2024. Each quarter, our Board of Directors considers whether to approve the payment of a dividend. Under the terms of the March 2028 note purchase agreement, the annual amount of permitted dividend payments is capped at the lesser of 36 million or a maximum dividend yield of 6.25 . In addition, share repurchases would further limit this amount. We currently expect to continue paying a quarterly dividend; however, no assurances can be given. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 At September 30, 2024, there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Interim Chief Financial Officer (CFO), to allow timely decisions regarding disclosures. 
 With the participation of our CEO and CFO, management evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods. In addition, no changes in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter covered by this report that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal control over financial reporting. 
 It should be noted that any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions designed to obtain reasonable (and not absolute) assurance as to its effectiveness, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals. Notwithstanding this caution, the CEO and CFO have reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1: Legal Proceedings 
 See Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 1A: Risk Factors 
 There were no material changes to the risk factors identified in Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report other than those shown below: 
 Changes within our senior management and our Board of Directors could create uncertainties and impact our business. 
 We have undergone recent changes in our senior management and in the composition of our Board of Directors. These changes, and potential future changes, may create continuity risks and challenges to our ability to operate the businesses and execute our strategy. In addition, such changes may, among other things, create uncertainty among investors, customers, employees, and others concerning our future direction and performance, make it difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and impact our credit ratings and our ability to access capital markets at reasonable costs. 
 We are subject to risks relating to the Ecommerce Restructuring and related transactions. 
 On August 8, 2024, we completed the GEC Sale. There are numerous risks and uncertainties that may be associated with the Ecommerce Restructuring, including, among others, the costs related to the Chapter 11 proceedings; the length of time necessary to implement the orderly wind-down of the Global Ecommerce business associated with the Ecommerce Debtors the Ecommerce Debtors ability to navigate the Chapter 11 proceedings and consummate a Chapter 11 plan; potential impacts to the Company s reputation and relationships with its customers, vendors, employees, and other counterparties and impacts to the Company s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 There can be no assurances that the Ecommerce Restructuring will limit the Company s liability under certain contracts and obligations associated with the Ecommerce Debtors and claims may be asserted against the Company and/or its affiliates. As part of the Ecommerce Restructuring, the Company and the Ecommerce Debtors have entered into the Settlement Agreement, which attaches the RSA and the DIP Facility, and includes a release of all existing or potential causes of action among the Company and the Ecommerce Debtors. The Settlement Agreement is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and there is no assurance that such approval will be granted. If the Settlement Agreement is not approved or substantial modifications are made to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company may be subject to significant claims by the Ecommerce Debtors. Any assertions of claims against the Company or any of its affiliates, may require significant effort, resources, and money to defend or could result in material losses to the Company, and such losses could have a material negative effect on the Company s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. We can provide no assurance that any such claims, if asserted, will be resolved in manner that is satisfactory to the Company. 
 Furthermore, while we no longer control the management of the Ecommerce Debtors, we retained an economic equity interest therein; however, such economic equity interest is not anticipated to receive any recovery or distribution as part of the Ecommerce Restructuring. We nevertheless remain exposed to the business risks and continued costs applicable to the Ecommerce Debtors through our investment in the DIP Facility, which could be significant. Hilco anticipates the Ecommerce Restructuring will be substantially completed by the end of 2024. In addition, management of the Company may need to spend a significant amount of time and effort attending to matters related to the Ecommerce Restructuring, diverting their focus from the Company s remaining business operations. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the restructuring process, we are unable to predict with certainty the timing, outcome or financial impact of the Ecommerce Restructuring. 
 We anticipate achieving significant benefits and cost savings from the Ecommerce Restructuring. However, the anticipated benefits and cost savings may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected. The restructuring may also result in additional and unforeseen expenses. The Company has estimated that it will incur substantial expenses in connection with the Ecommerce Restructuring; however, actual expenses may be greater than anticipated. If we are unable to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings, or the expenses associated with the Ecommerce Restructuring exceed our estimates, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

 (iii) Dividend Equivalent Shares shall be counted against the Plan Maximum, and clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section shall not apply to such Awards. 
 
 (iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Shares subject to an Award under the Plan may not again be made available for issuance under the Plan if such Shares are (A) Shares that were subject to an Option or a stock-settled Stock Appreciation Right and were not issued upon the net settlement or net exercise of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, (B) Shares delivered to or withheld by the Company to pay the exercise price of an Option or the withholding taxes related to an Award, or (C) Shares repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of an Option exercise.

Restricted Stock is an Award or issuance of Shares of common stock the grant, issuance, retention, vesting and or transferability of which is subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate. Terms and conditions may include, without limitation, continued employment over a specified period or the attainment of specified performance criteria (including, but not limited to, one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria in accordance with Section 15). Conditions may lapse separately or concurrently at such time or times, in such installments or otherwise, as the Committee may deem appropriate. Stock Units are Awards denominated in units of common stock under which the issuance of Shares of common stock is subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate. Terms and conditions may include, without limitation, continued employment over a specified period or the attainment of specified performance criteria (including, but not limited to, one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria in accordance with Section 15). Each grant of Restricted Stock and Stock Units shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement. A Stock Unit may be settled in cash or Shares as the Committee may determine from time to time. 
 (c) Dividend Equivalents. The Committee may, as a component of any other Award granted under the Plan, grant to Participants Dividend Equivalents under which the holders thereof shall be entitled to receive payments equivalent to dividends with respect to a number of Shares determined by the Committee, and the Committee may provide that such amounts shall be deemed to have been reinvested in Dividend Equivalent Shares or otherwise reinvested. Dividend equivalents may not be (i) granted in conjunction with options or SARs. Dividend equivalents shall be subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying Award and shall only be settled if and to the extent the underlying Award vests. 

(d) Other Stock-Based Awards. The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Participants such other Awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to Shares (including without limitation securities convertible into Shares), as are deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan. 

(i) If applicable, Shares or other securities delivered pursuant to a purchase right granted under this Section 7(d) shall be purchased for such consideration, which may be paid by such method or methods and in such form or forms, including without limitation cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property, or any combination thereof, as the Committee shall determine. 
 D-11 

(ii) In granting any Other Stock-Based Award pursuant to this Section 7(d), the Committee shall also determine what effect the termination of employment of the Participant holding such Award shall have on the rights of the Participant pursuant to the Award. 
 
 Section 8. Vesting and Exercising. 
 (a) General. The Award Agreement shall designate the terms under which the Award vests and or is exercisable according to terms and conditions authorized by the Committee and consistent with Plan provisions. There will be a one-year minimum vesting period for all awards under the Plan. For purposes of Awards granted to non-employee members of the Board, one-year may mean the period of time from one annual shareholders meeting to the next annual shareholders meeting, provided that such period of time is not less than fifty (50) weeks. Unless the Board provides otherwise, Stock Option and SAR awards must have a vesting period of not less than one-year. For purposes of the Plan, any reference to the vesting of an Option or a SAR shall mean any events or conditions which, if satisfied, entitle a Participant to exercise an Option or a SAR with respect to all or a portion of the Shares covered by the Option or a SAR. Vesting of a Restricted Stock Award or a Stock Unit shall mean any events or conditions which, if satisfied, entitle the Participant to the underlying stock certificate without restrictions (or cash as the case may be). Any awards of Restricted Stock or Stock Units as to which the sole restriction relates to the passage of time and continued employment must have a restriction period of not less than one year. Any Award, other than an Award described in the immediately preceding sentence, must provide for the lapse of restrictions based on performance criteria and level of achievement versus such criteria over a performance period of not less than one year, except in all cases, the Committee may provide for the satisfaction and or lapse of all restrictions under any such Award in the event of the Participant s death, Disability or Retirement or a Change of Control and other similar events. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company reserves the right to make Awards representing up to 5 of the total Shares issued under the Plan that are fully vested upon the making of the Award or that require vesting periods shorter than those described in this Section 8 (a). In addition, the Committee may in its sole discretion accelerate vesting of an Award made hereunder on account of a Termination with Conditions Imposed as described under Section 8(b)(iii) in cases such as death, Disability and Retirement or following a Change of Control as discussed in Section 10 herein. Except as otherwise permitted by Section 409A of the Code, an Award constituting nonqualified deferred compensation subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code shall not be accelerated. 

(b) Termination of Employment. Unless the Committee specifies otherwise, either at the time of grant or thereafter, the following rules govern Awards upon a Participant s termination of employment not on account of a Change of Control 

(i) Death, Disability and Retirement. Unvested outstanding Awards (including without limitation Stock Options, SARs, Restricted Stock or Stock Units), forfeit at death, Disability or Retirement unless the Committee, in its sole discretion, provides in the Award Agreement or otherwise for special vesting under those circumstances. With respect to Stock Options and SARS any special vesting provided by the Committee may also include an additional exercise period beyond the Participant s death, Disability or Retirement, however, that period may not be longer than the original term of the Award. The Committee may also waive in whole or in part any or all remaining restrictions and vest the Awards upon the Participant s death, Disability or Retirement. In addition, the Committee in its sole discretion may set forth special vesting rules with respect to Dividend Equivalents and Other Stock-Based Awards and may determine that the Participant s rights to Dividend Equivalents and Other Stock-Based Awards terminate at a date later than death, Disability and Retirement. 

(ii) Sale of Business, Spin off Transactions. In the case of a sale of business or a spin off transaction that does not constitute a Change of Control, the Committee shall determine the treatment of all outstanding Awards, including without limitation, determining the vesting terms, conversion of Shares and continued exercisability. Further, in the event the business unit (defined as a division, subsidiary, unit or other delineation that the Committee in its sole discretion may determine) for which the Participant performs substantially all of his or her services is spun off by the Company or an Affiliate in a transaction that qualifies as a tax-free distribution of stock under Section 355 of the Code, or is assigned, sold, outsourced or otherwise transferred, including an asset, stock or joint venture transaction, to an unrelated third party, such that after such transaction the Company owns or controls directly or indirectly less than 51 of the business unit, the Committee shall determine the treatment of all outstanding Awards held by the affected Participants 

D-12 

(iii) Terminations with Conditions Imposed. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions describing the additional exercise and vesting periods for Awards upon termination of employment, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, condition the right of a Participant to vest or exercise any portion of a partially vested or exercisable Award for which the Committee has established at the time of making the Award an additional vesting or exercise period on the Participant s agreement to adhere to such conditions and stipulations which the Committee may impose, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the solicitation of employees or independent contractors, disclosure of confidential information, covenants not to compete, refraining from denigrating through adverse or disparaging communication, written or oral, whether or not true, the operations, business, management, products or services of the Company or its current or former employees and directors, including without limitation, the expression of personal views, opinions or judgments. The unvested Awards of any Participant for whom the Committee at the time of making the Award has given an additional vesting and exercise period subject to such conditions subsequent as set forth in this Section 8(b)(iii) shall be forfeited immediately upon a breach of such conditions and, if specified in an Award Agreement, any rights, payments or benefits with respect to an Award that became vested in connection with a termination of employment may be subject to recoupment upon a breach of such conditions. 

(iv) Termination for Other Reasons. If a Participant terminates employment for reasons other than those enumerated above or in Section 10 below and the Committee has not created special rules surrounding the circumstances of the employment termination, the following rules shall apply. 

(A) Options and SARs. Any vested, unexercised portion of an Option or SAR at the time of the termination shall be forfeited in its entirety if not exercised by the Participant within three (3) months of the date of termination of employment. Any portion of such partially vested Option or SAR that is not vested at the time of termination shall be forfeited. Any outstanding Option or SAR granted to a Participant terminating employment other than for death, Disability or Retirement, for which no vesting has occurred at the time of the termination shall be forfeited on the date of termination. 

(B) Restricted Stock and Stock Units. All unvested Restricted Stock and Stock Units, or any unvested portion thereof, still subject to restrictions shall be forfeited upon termination of employment and reacquired by the Company. 

(C) Dividend Equivalents and Other Stock-Based Awards. Any Dividend Equivalents or unvested portion of Other Stock- Based Awards made hereunder shall be forfeited upon termination of employment. 

(c) Forfeiture and Recoupment of Awards 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if at any time (including after a notice of exercise has been delivered) the Committee, including any subcommittee or administrator authorized pursuant to Section 3(c) (any such person, an Authorized Officer ), reasonably believes that a Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct as defined in this Section, the Authorized Officer may suspend the Participant s right to exercise any Stock Option or SAR or receive Shares under any other Award pending a determination of whether the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct. If the Committee or an Authorized Officer determines a Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct, as defined herein, (including any Participant who may otherwise qualify for Disability or Retirement status), the Participant shall forfeit all outstanding Awards, whether vested or unvested, as of the date such Gross Misconduct occurs. In addition, the Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant s rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to recoupment upon the occurrence of Gross Misconduct. For purposes of the Plan, Gross Misconduct shall be defined to mean (1) the Participant s conviction of a felony (or crime of similar magnitude in non-U.S. jurisdictions) in connection with the performance or non-performance of the Participant s duties or (2) the Participant s willful act or failure to act in a way that results in material injury to the business or reputation of the Company or employees of the Company. Material injury for this purpose means substantial and not inconsequential as determined by the Committee, or its delegate. For this purpose there is no intended similarity between Material Injury and the accounting or securities standard of materiality. 

D-13 

(ii) The Committee, in its sole discretion, may forfeit any outstanding Award on account of a Participant s violation of the terms of the Proprietary Interest Protection Agreement or similar agreement signed by the Participant which prohibits the Participant s assignment of intellectual property, transmission of confidential information, competition or solicitation of employees or business. In addition, the Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant s rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to recoupment upon such a violation. 
 
 (d) Deferral of Taxation. The Committee may establish rules allowing employees receiving stock awards under this Plan to defer the incidence of taxation on the vesting of an award in accordance with the rules promulgated under the Code. 
 
 (e) Awards Subject to Clawback Policies. All Awards and amounts payable under the Plan are additionally subject to the terms of any applicable clawback policies approved by the Board or Committee, as in effect from time to time, whether approved before or after the date of grant of an Award (as applicable, a Clawback Policy ). Further, to the extent permitted by applicable law, including without limitation Section 409A of the Code, all amounts payable under the Plan are subject to offset in the event that a Participant has an outstanding clawback, recoupment or forfeiture obligation to the Company under the terms of any applicable Clawback Policy. In the event of a clawback, recoupment or forfeiture event under an applicable Clawback Policy, the amount required to be clawed back, recouped or forfeited pursuant to such policy shall be deemed not to have been earned under the terms of the Plan, and the Company shall be entitled to recover from the Participant the amount specified under the Clawback Policy to be clawed back, recouped or forfeited. IN ACCEPTING AN AWARD UNDER THE PLAN, A PARTICIPANT EXPRESSLY AGREES TO APPLICATION OF ANY APPLICABLE CLAWBACK POLICY. 

Section 9. Amendment and Termination of Awards. 
 Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise expressly provided in an Award Agreement or in the Plan, the following shall apply to all Awards. 
 (a) Amendments to Awards. Subject to Section 11, the Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, cancel or terminate, any Award heretofore granted without the consent of any relevant Participant or holder or beneficiary of an Award. No such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance, cancellation or termination may be made that would be adverse to the holder of such Award without such holder s consent, provided that no such consent shall be required with respect to any amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance, cancellation or termination if the Committee determines in its sole discretion that such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance, cancellation or termination either (i) is required or advisable in order for the Company, the Plan or the Award to satisfy or conform to any law or regulation or to meet the requirements of any accounting standard, or (ii) is not reasonably likely to significantly diminish the benefits provided under such Award, or that any such diminishment has been adequately compensated. Subject to the foregoing, the Committee shall not waive any condition or rights under, amend any terms or alter, suspend, discontinue, cancel or terminate any Award if such action would result in the imposition on the Award of the additional tax provided for under Section 409A of the Code. 
 
 (b) Adjustments of Awards Upon Certain Acquisitions . In the event the Company or an Affiliate shall issue Substitute Awards, the Committee may make such adjustments, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, in the terms of Awards as it shall deem appropriate in order to achieve reasonable comparability or other equitable relationship between the assumed Awards and the Substitute Awards granted under the Plan. 

(c) Amendments . No amendment, modification or termination shall accelerate the payment date of any Award constituting nonqualified deferred compensation subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, except to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the imposition of the additional tax provided for under Section 409A of the Code. 

Section 10. Acceleration Upon a Change of Control. 
 In the event of a Change of Control, the following shall apply 
 (a) Effect on Awards. If a Participant incurs a Termination of Employment on account of a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2 (hh), as amended from time to time) upon or within two years after a Change of Control, or if a Participant is terminated before a Change of Control at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect 
 
 D-14 

a Change of Control and a Change of Control subsequently occurs, then upon the later to occur of such Termination of Employment or Change of Control (such later event, the Triggering Event 
 (i) Options and SARs. All Options and SARs outstanding on the date of such Triggering Event shall become immediately and fully exercisable without regard to any vesting schedule provided for in the Option or SAR and, to the extent the award is assumed by the acquirer, shall remain exercisable until the expiration of the option term. If Termination of Employment occurs after the Change of Control, but within two years of the Change of Control, all Options and SARs are vested upon the Change of Control and will become exercisable upon the earlier of the normal vesting date or upon Termination of Employment and will remain exercisable for the balance of the award term. If outstanding Option or SAR awards are not assumed by the acquirer, then the Options and SARs are exercisable upon the Change of Control if the Fair Market Value exceeds the exercise price. 

(ii) Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. On the date of such Triggering Event, all restrictions applicable to any Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit shall terminate and be deemed to be fully satisfied for the entire stated restricted period of any such Award, and the total number of underlying Shares shall become Released Securities. If Termination of Employment occurs after the Change of Control, but within two years of the Change of Control, or if outstanding Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units are not assumed by the acquirer, they will vest upon the Change of Control and will be converted into common stock at the earlier of normal vesting dates or Termination of Employment. 

(iii) Dividend Equivalents. On the date of such Triggering Event, the holder of any outstanding Dividend Equivalent shall be entitled to surrender such Award to the Company and to receive payment of an amount equal to the amount that would have been paid over the remaining term of the Dividend Equivalent, as determined by the Committee. If Termination of Employment occurs after the Change of Control, but within two years of the Change of Control, or if Dividend Equivalent Awards are not assumed by the acquirer, they will vest upon the Change of Control and will be paid at the earlier of normal vesting dates or Termination of Employment. 

(iv) Other Stock-Based Awards . On the date of such Triggering Event, all outstanding Other Stock-Based Awards of whatever type shall become immediately vested and payable in an amount that assumes that the Awards were outstanding for the entire period stated therein, as determined by the Committee. If Termination of Employment occurs after the Change of Control, but within two years of the Change of Control, or if the Other Stock-Based Awards are not assumed by the acquirer, they will vest upon the Change of Control and will be paid at the earlier of normal vesting dates or Termination of Employment 

(v) Performance Awards. On the date of such Triggering Event, Performance Awards conditioned on Performance Goals, including without limitation Stock Units, subject to achievement of performance goals for all performance periods, including those not yet completed, shall immediately become fully vested and shall be immediately payable or exercisable or released in common stock or cash, as the case may be, as if the Performance Goals had been fully achieved at target for the entire performance period. If Termination of Employment occurs after the Change of Control, but within two years of the Change of Control, or if the Performance Awards are not assumed by the acquirer, they will vest upon the Change of Control as if target performance for the entire performance period had been achieved and will be converted into common stock or paid in cash, as the case may be, at the earlier of normal vesting dates or Termination of Employment. 

(vi) The Committee s determination of amounts payable under this Section 10 shall be final. Except as otherwise provided in Section 10, any amounts due under this Section 10 shall be paid to Participants within 45 days after such Triggering Event. 
 (vii) The provisions of this Section 10 shall not be applicable to any Award granted to a Participant if the Change of Control results from such Participant s beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) of Shares or other Company common stock or Company voting securities as a Participant in a transaction described in (b) below. 
 
 (viii) To the extent required to avoid any additional taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code, in the event of a resignation of a Participant on account of Good Reason (as defined in Section 2(hh) above), if the period during which a payment or benefit may be made by the Company falls within more than one calendar year, such payment or benefit shall be provided to the Participant in the later calendar year. 
 D-15 

(b) Change of Control Defined. A Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred as described in Section 2(e) (as amended from time to time). However, that, as to any Award under the Plan that consists of deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, the definition of Change of Control shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A. 
 
 Section 11. Amendment or Termination of the Plan. 
 Except to the extent limited under Section 15 herein, prohibited by applicable law or otherwise expressly provided in an Award Agreement or in the Plan, the Board of Directors may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan, including without limitation any such action to correct any defect, supply any omission, clarify any ambiguity or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan, without the consent of any stockholder, Participant, other holder or beneficiary of an Award, or Person provided that any such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation, or termination that would impair the rights of any Participant, or any other holder or beneficiary of any Award heretofore granted shall not be effective without the approval of the affected Participant(s) and provided further, that, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation or termination shall be made that would 
 (a) increase the total number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan, except as provided in Section 4 hereof 
 
 (b) reduce the price at which Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted below the price provided for in Section 7(a)(i) 
 (c) reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights 
 (d) extend the term of this Plan 
 (e) change the class of persons eligible to be Participants or 
 (f) otherwise amend the Plan in any manner requiring stockholder approval by law or under the New York Stock Exchange listing requirements. 
 
 Section 12. General Provisions. 
 (a) Conditions and Restrictions Upon Securities Subject to Awards. The Committee may provide that the Shares issued upon exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or otherwise subject to or issued under an Award shall be subject to such further agreements, restrictions, conditions or limitations as the Committee in its discretion may specify prior to the exercise of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right or the grant, vesting or settlement of such Award, including without limitation, conditions on vesting or transferability, forfeiture or repurchase provisions and method of payment for the Shares issued upon exercise, vesting or settlement of such Award (including the actual or constructive surrender of Shares already owned by the Participant) or payment of taxes arising in connection with an Award. Without limiting the foregoing, such restrictions may address the timing and manner of any resales by the Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any Shares issued under an Award, including without limitation, (i) restrictions under an insider trading policy or pursuant to applicable law, (ii) restrictions designed to delay and or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by Participant and holders of other Company equity compensation arrangements, (iii) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers and (iv) provisions requiring Shares to be sold on the open market or to the Company in order to satisfy tax withholding or other obligations. 

(b) Compliance with Laws and Regulations. This Plan, the grant, issuance, vesting, exercise and settlement of Awards thereunder, and the obligation of the Company to sell, issue or deliver Shares under such Awards, shall be subject to all applicable Federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations, stock exchange rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental or regulatory agency as may be required. The Company shall not be required to register in a Participant s name or deliver any Shares prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of such shares under any Federal, state, local or foreign law or any ruling or regulation of any government body which the Committee shall determine to be necessary or advisable. To the extent the Company is unable to or the Committee deems it not appropriate or infeasible to obtain authorization from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authorization is deemed by the Company s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, or otherwise to satisfy the legal requirements in an applicable jurisdiction in a manner consistent with the 
 
 D-16 

intention of the Plan or any Award under the Plan, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be relieved of any liability with respect to the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. No Option or stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights shall be exercisable and no Shares shall be issued and or transferable under any other Award unless a registration statement with respect to the Shares underlying such Option or Stock Appreciation Rights is effective and current or the Company has determined that such registration is unnecessary. 
 
 (c) No Rights to Awards. No Employee, Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Employees, Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each Participant. 
 
 (d) No Limit on Other Compensation Agreements. Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. 
 
 (e) No Right to Employment. The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement. 

(f) Withholding. To the extent required by applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law, a Participant (including the Participant to whom an Award that has been transferred was originally granted) or in the case of the Participant s death, the Participant s estate or beneficiary, shall be required to satisfy, in a manner satisfactory to the Company, any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise, disposition of Shares issued under an Incentive Stock Option, the vesting of or settlement of an Award, an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code or otherwise with respect to an Award. The Company and its Affiliates shall not be required to issue Shares, make any payment or to recognize the transfer or disposition of Shares until such obligations are satisfied. The Company or any Affiliate may withhold from any Award granted or any payment due or transfer made under any Award or under the Plan the amount (in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards, or other property) of withholding Federal, state or local taxes due in respect of an Award, but no more than the minimum tax withholding required to comply with such law, its exercise, or any payment or transfer under such Award or under the Plan and to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company or Affiliate to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. 
 
 (g) Governing Law. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable Federal law. 

(h) Severability. If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person, or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect. 
 
 (i) No Trust or Fund Created. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate. 
 
 (j) No Fractional Shares. No fractional Share shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash, other securities, or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares, or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated, or otherwise eliminated. 

(k) Headings. Headings are given to the sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof. 
 
 D-17 

Section 13. Effective Date of the Plan. 
 The Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on April 8, 2024, and shall have an effective date of May 6, 2024 (the Effective Date ), which was the date of approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company at the May 2024 annual stockholders meeting. 
 
 Section 14. Term of the Plan. 
 No Award shall be granted under the Plan after May 6, 2034. However, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in an applicable Award Agreement, any Award theretofore granted may extend beyond such date, and the authority of the Committee hereunder to amend, alter, adjust, suspend, discontinue, or terminate any such Award, or to waive any conditions or rights under any such Award, and the authority of the Board of Directors of the Company to amend, modify or terminate the Plan, shall extend beyond such date. 
 
 Section 15. Committee Discretion and Internal Revenue Code Compliance. 
 (a) The Committee may, in its sole discretion, reduce the number of Shares subject to Covered Awards or the amount which would otherwise be payable pursuant to Covered Awards provided, however, that the provisions of Section 9 shall override any contrary provision of this Section 15. 
 
 (b) The Committee may appropriately adjust any evaluation of performance under a Performance Goal to eliminate the effects of charges for restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and all items of gain, loss or expense determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or related to the disposal of a segment or a business or related to a change in accounting principle all as determined in accordance with standards established by opinion No. 30 of the Accounting Principles Board (APB Opinion No. 30) or other applicable or successor accounting provisions, as well as the cumulative effect of accounting changes, in each case as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or identified in the Company s financial statements, including the notes thereto, and (B) may appropriately adjust any evaluation of performance under a Performance Goal to exclude any of the following events that occurs during a performance period (i) asset write-downs, (ii) litigation, claims, judgments or settlements, (iii) the effect of changes in tax law or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results, (iv)accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs, and (v) accruals of any amounts for payment under this Plan or any other compensation arrangement maintained by the Company. 
 
 (c) Internal Revenue Code Compliance The Committee intends to structure awards under this Plan to be deductible under the Internal Revenue Code wherever possible. However, since corporate objectives may not always be consistent with the requirements for full deductibility, the Committee reserves the right, when appropriate, to issue awards under this Plan which may not be deductible under the Internal Revenue Code. Specifically, Awards under the Plan are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and all Awards shall be interpreted in accordance with such section and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the effective date of the Plan. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Committee determines that any Award may or does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, the Company may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the affected Award (without Participant consent) or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt any Award from the application of Section 409A of the Code and or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to such Award, or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The Committee may from time to time establish procedures pursuant to which Covered Employees will be permitted or required to defer receipt of amounts payable under Awards made under the Plan provided, however, that any such deferral shall be implemented in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable.

The Committee shall fix the period during which such performance is to be measured (the Cycle ), the time at which the value of the Units is to be paid, and 
 1

Exhibit 10.9 
 
 PITNEY BOWES EXECUTIVE EQUITY DEFERRAL PLAN 
 
 I. Establishment and Purpose 
 
 The purpose of the Pitney Bowes Executive Equity Deferral Plan Plan is to allow key executives Participants at Pitney Bowes Inc. and its designated subsidiaries and affiliates Company who receive equity awards as part of the Participant s long-term incentive compensation, such as restricted stock units RSU and performance stock units PSU ), under the Pitney Bowes 2013 Stock Plan, the Amended and Restated Pitney Bowes Inc. 2018 Stock Plan or any approved successor plan to either of the forgoing, to defer settlement of those equity awards until termination of employment or termination of employment following attainment of age 60 with 5 years of employment service Retirement ). The Plan was approved by the Executive Compensation Committee and the board of directors on November 7, 2014 to facilitate Company executives in accumulating sizable holdings of the Company s common stock as required under the Company s Executive Stock Ownership Policy and to further align executive compensation with the interests of Company stockholders. The Plan was amended September 11, 2023 and again on November 5, 2024, with changes effective immediately, except when later effective dates are otherwise provided for in the Plan, to provide that all amounts deferred under the Plan may be subject to applicable Clawback Policies (as defined below). This Plan may be offered to Participants in countries outside the United States on a country by country basis at the sole discretion of the Company. The Plan is intended to comply with the rules under the Internal Revenue Code and specifically Section 409A IRC 409A ). 
 
 II. Eligibility to Participate 
 
 An executive becomes eligible to participate in this Plan upon receipt of specific written notification of eligibility to participate from the Company. Generally, only the Company s senior executives are eligible to participate in the Plan. 
 
 III. Deferral Election 
 
 A Participant shall submit a deferral election on a form furnished or approved by the Company regarding an equity award. The election generally must be made in the year prior to the year that the award is approved by the board or the Company. However, the Company may set up procedures to accept deferral elections at such other times as are consistent with IRC 409A such as (1) elections for newly eligible executives, where the election is to be made within 30 days of initial eligibility, and (2) performance based compensation deferral elections, where the election can be made up to six months before the end of the performance period if (a) the Participant performs services continuously from the later of the beginning of the performance period or the date the 

performance criteria are established and (b) the satisfaction of the performance criteria is not readily ascertainable as of the time the election is made. A deferral election will not be allowed for awards or portions thereof that otherwise would vest and be settled within 12 months of the election, unless specifically allowed under the Plan and under IRC 409A. 
 
 An election to defer the settlement of an award must include the entire award type made on that award date. For example, if the Participant is awarded both an RSU and PSU award, the Participant may elect to defer the entirety of either or both types of awards. Partial deferrals of equity awards will not be allowed under the Plan. 
 
 The Company may allow Participants to elect a modification of a prior election but only if the modification is made more than 12 months prior to when the settlement would otherwise occur and does not take effect for at least 12 months from the date of the modification election. Where the modification is deemed a subsequent election under IRC 409A, the deferral period or award settlement date is postponed by five years from the original Default Settlement Date or elected distribution date, as applicable. 
 
 Once a deferral election is made, the election may not be revoked and the deferral period may not be accelerated except as provided under this Plan document. 
 
 A Participant s deferral election will be cancelled (1) for the balance of the Plan Year in which an unforeseeable emergency payment is made, (2) through the end of the Plan Year in which the six-month anniversary of a 401(k) Plan hardship distribution falls, and during the period in which the Participant is unable to perform duties of his or her position or substantially similar position due to a mental or physical impairment that can be expect to result in death or last for a continuous period of at least six months. 
 
 IV. Deferral Term 
 
 A Participant may elect to defer settlement of an equity award in the following ways (1) to a date certain while the Participant is still employed, (2) to termination of employment or Retirement or (3) over a period of ten years commencing at termination of employment, provided that if the Participant is not eligible to Retire, settlement shall instead be made at termination of employment. If a participant defers settlement to a date certain while still employed but terminates employment prior to the date certain, settlement of the equity award will occur upon termination of employment under Article V below. 
 
 V. Settlement 
 
 Settlement of deferred equity units means the conversion of an equity unit into a full unrestricted share of Company common stock and the distribution of such shares to the 

Participant, to the extent allowable under law. Fractional shares at settlement will either be payable in cash or used for additional withholding taxes. 
 
 The Plan s Default Date of Settlement is (1) if the deferral was to a date certain and the Participant is still employed at such date certain, then settlement will occur within 30 days of the date certain and (2) if the Participant terminates employment then settlement will be during the 7 month following the Participant s termination of employment. If the participant elects settlement over a ten-year period following termination from employment and is eligible to Retire at the time of termination from employment, the settlement shall be made in equal share installments with the first settlement being made during the seventh month following the Participant s termination from employment and each successive installment being in the same month in successive calendar years. Installment payments shall be treated as a single form of payment under the Plan. If the Participant has elected to defer an award to be settled in installments but terminates prior to Retirement, the award will be settled during the seventh month following the Participant s termination from employment notwithstanding the Participant s election. 
 
 VI. Vesting 
 
 Subject to Section XI, equity awards shall vest in accordance with the underlying equity award terms and Participants who submit a deferral election are deferring the settlement of such awards to the deferral date elected or allowed under this Plan. 
 
 VII. Deferral of Dividend Dividend Equivalents 
 
 The underlying equity award shall specify when and if dividends are payable under the equity award. Dividend equivalents on deferred awards will be deferred into additional deferred restricted stock units under the same terms as the underlying deferred equity award generating those dividend equivalents. If dividends are payable under the equity award (e.g. after vesting of the award), dividend equivalents under deferred equity awards will be converted into additional vested restricted stock units with settlement deferred until the base deferral is settled pursuant to the Participant s election or the Plan terms. Dividend equivalents will be deferred into additional vested restricted stock units based on the New York Stock Exchange closing stock price for the Company s stock on the date the dividend on Company stock is otherwise paid to stockholders. Deferred dividend converted into additional restricted stock units will be converted into Company common shares at the same time as the equity award which gave rise to the dividend equivalent. Regular stock dividends will be payable once the units are converted into common shares at the end of the deferral period. 

VIII. Voting Rights 
 
 Deferred equity awards are considered notional or phantom shares and do not carry voting rights until they are settled into common shares at the end of the deferral period. 
 
 IX. Death and Disability 
 
 In the event of a Participant s death, vested deferred units will be settled and converted in Company common stock in the second month immediately following the Participant s death and will be payable to the Participant s estate unless the Participant has designated in writing a specific beneficiary(ies). 
 
 In the event of a Participant s total disability, which shall be defined as the Participant s termination from employment after two years on long term disability benefits, any outstanding deferred units shall be settled and converted in Company common stock in the seventh month immediately following the Participant s termination of employment on account of disability. Settlement shall be treated as a termination of employment or Retirement as the case may be. 
 
 X. Change of Control 
 
 If a Change of Control of Pitney Bowes Inc. meets the requirements of IRC Section 409A, deferred equity units will be converted into Company common stock upon the Participant s termination of employment on account of a Change of Control and within 24 months of the Change of Control. Change of Control shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the Company s Senior Executive Severance Policy. 
 
 XI. Applicable Clawback Policies. 
 
 Deferred Compensation accrued on or after October 2, 2023 is subject to forfeiture under the terms of any applicable Clawback Policy and shall not be deemed nonforfeitable or unconditionally vested until any such Clawback Policy is no longer applicable. Further, to the extent permitted by applicable law, including without limitation Code Section 409A, all amounts deferred and or payable under the Plan are subject to offset in the event that a Participant has an outstanding clawback, recoupment or forfeiture obligation to the Company under the terms of any applicable Clawback Policy. In the event of a forfeiture event under an applicable Clawback Policy, any amounts required to be forfeited pursuant to such policy shall be deemed not to have been earned under the terms of the Plan, and the Company shall be entitled to recover from the Participant the amount specified under the Clawback Policy to be forfeited. 
 
 Clawback Policy means any applicable clawback policy approved by the Board of Directors or the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, as in 

effect from time to time (including, without limitation, the Compensation Recoupment Policy of the Company), whether approved or amended before or after the deferral of compensation. 
 
 XII. Tax Withholding 
 
 To the extent required by federal, state, local or foreign law, the Company may withhold applicable taxes upon settlement of a deferred equity award, including settlement of reinvested units derived from dividend equivalents, by withholding units or stock issued on the settlement. 
 
 XIII. Amendment 
 
 Except for non-material administrative changes, all other amendments to this Plan requires the approval of the Executive Compensation Committee. This Plan may be terminated by the Executive Compensation Committee of the board. Amendments and termination may occur without prior notification. 
 
 XIV. General Assets 
 
 To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments hereunder, such rights are no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. Nothing contained in this Plan and no action taken pursuant to its provisions shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and the Participant or beneficiaries. No Participant shall have any right, title or interest whatever in the assets of the Company (or participating company). 
 
 XV. Anti-assignment Rule 
 
 A Participant may not assign any interest or benefit under this Plan for any purposes. Purported assignments shall be null and void and of no effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary here in the Company may, at is sole discretion, make distributions to an alternate payee in accordance with the terms of domestic relations order (See IRC Section 414(p)(1)(B)). 
 
 XVI. No Employment Contract or No Acquired Right 
 
 Nothing contained herein shall be construed to constitute an employment contract between the Company and the Participant. The benefits provided by this Plan shall not rise to the level of an acquired right. 

XVII. Executive Stock Ownership Policy 
 
 Fully vested but deferred units shall count toward the ownership requirements under the Executive Stock Ownership Policy. 
 
 XVIII. Participant Duties 
 
 Participants must keep the Company advised at all times of his or her current mailing address and other contact information. 
 
 XIX. Designation of Beneficiary 
 
 A participant may designate a beneficiary(ies) by submitting to the Company the beneficiary information in writing according to the format approved by the Company. If a distribution is to be made to a minor, or to a person who is incompetent, the Company may make the distribution to (1) a legal guardian, or if none, to a parent at the minor s residence, or (2) to a conservator, or (3) to a person having custody of an incompetent payee. Such distribution shall fully discharge the Company s liability. 
 
 XX. IRC Section 409A

Distributions may only be made under the Plan upon an event and in a manner permitted under IRC Section 409A.

 ###TOTAL_AWARDS### 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, the RSUs shall vest and be settled into shares in three approximately equal installments commencing on the fourth Tuesday in February each year following the Anniversary Date of the Award Date as set forth in the table below (the vest dates ), provided that you are continuously employed by the Company through the applicable vest date except as provided in this agreement. 
 
 ###VEST_SCHEDULE_TABLE### 
 
 In all cases, in no event will more than 100 of the RSUs vest. Notwithstanding any provisions in this agreement to the contrary, fractional RSUs shall not vest until the date on which the RSUs become 100 vested, and no Shares will be issued for fractional RSUs. 

Rights of the Participant with Respect to the Restricted Stock Units 
 The RSUs granted pursuant to this award do not and shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder or holder of common stock. Participants holding unvested RSUs shall not be entitled to receive dividends or dividend equivalents (cash payments equal to any cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to corresponding number of shares of Company stock), nor shall a participant have voting rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to RSUs unless and until the Participant becomes the record owner of the Shares underlying such RSUs. 

Vesting, Conversion of Restricted Stock Units and Issuance of Common Stock 
 Vesting of RSUs is conditioned upon your employment with the Company continuing until each respective vest date (unless provided otherwise in this agreement). As soon as practicable after each vest date, the Company shall cause to be issued to you, in book-entry form to your account at Shareworks, one share of the Company s common stock for each vested RSU, free and clear of the restrictions set forth in this agreement, in settlement of the RSUs. 
 
 In the case of death, common stock will be registered in the name of your estate s legal representatives, or heirs by will or laws of descent. Upon settlement of an RSU into a Share, you will obtain full voting rights as to such Share and will be entitled to receive cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such Share. If you are eligible to and have properly deferred the settlement of the RSUs into Shares in accordance with the Pitney Bowes Executive Equity Deferral Plan, the Pitney Bowes Executive Equity Deferral Plan will govern the terms of the deferral of the RSUs. 
 Termination Provisions and Vesting of RSUs 
 Except as set forth below, you must be employed by the Company through each respective vest date to receive Shares in settlement of the vested RSUs, and unvested RSUs will be forfeited upon termination of employment. The following charts describe the more common termination events and the impact on RSUs of certain terminations of your employment with the Company prior to the vest dates stated above. 
 
 Proration upon termination is based on the number of full months you are actively employed in the 36 months following the Award Date. For proration purposes, a full month of active employment is counted as being earned if the employee is actively employed on the last day of a relevant month. The first month earned in the calculation includes the month the award is granted. As example, an RSU grant with an Award Date in February 2024 would be prorated for 18 months with active employment through July 31, 2025.

PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT 
 
 Congratulations on your 2024 long-term incentive award! Your long-term incentive (LTI) award is determined based on your performance and is made in recognition of your past and expected future efforts and contributions to Pitney Bowes, its subsidiaries and affiliates Company ). In accordance with the 2024 LTI plan design, your performance stock units (PSUs) have been issued under the 2024 Stock Plan (as may be amended, the Plan ). To the extent any capitalized terms used in this PSU agreement are not defined, they shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Plan, which is made a part of this agreement. 
 
 Pursuant to the Plan, the Company hereby grants to you as of the Award Date specified below, and you hereby accept from the Company, the number of PSUs set forth below, on the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement and in the Plan. 
 
 About Your Performance Stock Unit (PSU) Award 
 
 A PSU represents your right to receive one share of Pitney Bowes common stock upon vesting of the PSU based upon performance goals, as determined in accordance with this agreement and the Plan, provided that you are continuously employed by the Company until the applicable vesting date except as provided herein 
 
 Award Date PSUs 
 ###GRANT_DATE### 
 
 ###TOTAL_AWARDS### 

###VEST_SCHEDULE_TABLE### 
 
 Notwithstanding any provisions in this agreement to the contrary, fractional PSUs shall not vest until the date on which the PSUs become 100 vested, and no Shares will be issued for fractional PSUs. 
 
 Performance Goals 
 The vesting of the PSUs is conditioned upon the Company first achieving pre-established performance goals approved by the Committee for the three-year performance period. The metrics used to determine the number of PSUs that vest at the end of the performance period are adjusted earnings per share (AEPS) and return on invested capital (ROIC), for which the three- 

year targets are established at the beginning of each year within the PSU three-year performance period and are consistent with our Company s objectives, as recommended by management and approved by the Committee. AEPS and ROIC objectives are equally weighted and in aggregate the unit multiplier can range from 0.00 to 2.00. Therefore, the maximum number of PSUs that can vest is two times the target number of PSUs. 
 
 The award is also subject to a cumulative three-year Total Shareholder Return TSR modifier established by the Committee which can increase or decrease the award by up to 25 depending on the Company s TSR versus the S&P 1000 index over the same cumulative three-year performance period. The TSR modifier is determined based on a percentile ranking over the three-year performance period as compared to the S&P 1000 index. If the Company s TSR is negative for the cumulative three-year performance period, there will be no positive application of the TSR modifier. Depending on performance and the application of the cumulative TSR modifier, anywhere from zero to 200 of the number of PSUs can vest. 
 
 All determinations regarding the extent of vesting of the PSU in any year or in the performance period will be made by the Committee. In determining whether and to what extent the vesting has been attained, the Committee may make adjustments based on unusual or unique circumstances or the impact of acquisitions, divestitures or other major unusual events. In addition, the Committee retains the prerogative of exercising negative discretion by taking into account the overall performance of the Company in determining the final vesting of a PSU award for each and any year. 
 
 Rights of the Participant with Respect to the Performance Stock Units 
 The PSUs granted pursuant to this award do not and shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder or holder of common stock. Participants holding unvested PSUs shall not be entitled to receive dividends or dividend equivalents (cash payments equal to any cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to corresponding number of shares of Company stock), nor shall a participant have voting rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to PSUs unless and until the Participant becomes the record owner of the Shares underlying such PSUs. 
 
 Vesting, Conversion of Performance Stock Units and Issuance of Common Stock 
 As soon as practicable following the conclusion of the three-year performance period, the Committee will determine the achievement of the performance goals for the PSUs. Generally, PSUs will vest on the fourth Tuesday in February following the end of the three-year performance period. The vesting of the PSUs is conditioned upon your employment with the Company continuing until the vesting date (unless provided otherwise in this agreement). 
 
 As soon as practicable after the vesting date, the Company shall cause to be issued to you, in book-entry form to your account at Shareworks, one share of the Company s common stock for each vested PSU, free and clear of the restrictions set forth in this agreement, in settlement of the vested PSUs.

The TSR modifier is determined based on a percentile ranking over the Cycle s three-year period as compared to the S&P 1000 index. If the Company s TSR is negative for the cumulative three-year period, there will not be a positive application of the TSR modifier. Depending on performance and the application of the cumulative TSR modifier, anywhere from zero to 200 of the number of target CIUs awarded can vest. Regardless of the Company s achievement of AEPS, ROIC or TSR, the payout shall not exceed the maximum allowable for CIUs provided to an individual per year as specified in the Plan. 
 
 Following the close of each three-year Cycle and prior to the vesting date, the Committee will determine whether and to what extent the performance criteria, and all other factors upon which the CIU payout is based, have been attained. In determining whether and to what extent performance criteria have been attained, the Committee may make adjustments based on unusual or unique circumstances or the impact of acquisitions, divestitures or other major unusual events. In addition, the Committee retains the prerogative of exercising negative discretion by taking into account the overall performance of the Company in determining the final vesting of a CIU award. 
 
 Vesting, Conversion of Cash Incentive Units 
 Except as provided below, to the extent the Committee determines the CIUs will become vested based on the performance criteria, the CIUs will vest on the fourth Tuesday in February following the end of the three-year Cycle, which is the Vesting Date set forth above. Following vesting, you will receive a cash payout based on the vested CIUs. The Committee has the authority to modify or extend the Vesting Date in its discretion. 
 Termination Provisions and Vesting of CIUs

 Pursuant to the Plan, the Company hereby grants to you as of the Grant Date specified below, and you hereby accept from the Company, the number of SCIUs set forth below, on the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement and in the Plan. 
 
 About Your Stock Cash Incentive Unit (SCIU) Award 
 The dollar value of 70 of your LTI award has been converted into ### Num_SCIUs### SCIUs. SCIUs are a cash-based award that vest and payout based on the Company s stock price performance. You are being granted one SCIU for each dollar of your LTI award allocated to SCIUs. Your SCIU, to the extent vested, will be payable equal annual installments on vesting dates that will generally fall between February 1 and March 15 of the first three calendar years, or Cycle, immediately following the calendar year of the award date. Vesting of the SCIUs is based upon the extent of achievement of stock price based performance criteria described below. The ticker symbol for the Company is PBI and we sometimes refer to the Company as PBI . While the target value of each SCIU is one dollar, the ultimate payout will be based on the Committee s determination of the Company s achievement of stock price based performance criteria described below. 
 
 The grant date and the number of SCIUs that have been awarded are specified below.

 Num_of_SCIUs 

The average of the closing PBI stock price of the first 10 trading days of 2024 was 4.22 . 
 
 ###VEST_SCHEDULE_TABLE### 

Performance Conditions 
 The number of SCIUs that will vest at the end of each year in the Cycle is determined by applying a Unit Multiplier to the target number of the SCIUs vesting during such year. The amount of the Unit Multiplier will be based on the percentage change in the average of the closing PBI stock price over the first 10 trading days of the first year and the average of the closing PBI stock price over the last 10 trading days of the year ending immediately preceding the vest date. The minimum and maximum number of SCIUs vesting in each year during the Cycle will be between 75 and 150 , respectively, of the SCIU subject to vesting in that year of the Cycle. The payout shall not exceed the maximum allowable units provided to an individual per year as specified in the Key Employees Incentive Plan Plan ). Further details on the vesting of your SCIU award are provided in the section below. 
 
 All determinations regarding the extent of vesting of the SCIU in any year or in the Cycle will be made by the Committee. In determining whether and to what extent the vesting has been attained, the Committee may make adjustments based on unusual or unique circumstances or the impact of acquisitions, divestitures or other major unusual events. In addition, the Committee retains the prerogative of exercising negative discretion by taking into account the overall performance of the Company in determining the final vesting of a SCIU award for each and any year. 
 
 Vesting, Conversion of Stock Cash Incentive Units 
 For this SCIU award, year one refers to calendar year 2024, year two refers to calendar year 2025, and year three refers to calendar year 2026. Below is an overview of how the Unit Multipliers for each performance year of your SCIU award will be calculated 
 
 First Vesting (after 2024 calendar year) The percentage change in the average of the closing PBI stock price of the first 10 trading days of year one versus the average of the closing PBI stock price of the last 10 trading days of year one (limited by the 75 minimum and 150 maximum Unit Multiplier thresholds). 
 Second Vesting (after 2025 calendar year) The percentage change in the average of the closing PBI stock price of the first 10 trading days of year one versus the average of the closing PBI stock price of the last 10 trading days of year two (limited by the 75 minimum and 150 maximum Unit Multiplier thresholds). 
 Third Vesting (after 2026 calendar year) The percentage change in the average of the closing PBI stock price of the first 10 trading days of year one versus the average of the closing PBI stock price of the last 10 trading days of year three (limited by the 75 minimum and 150 maximum Unit Multiplier thresholds). 
 
 As soon as practicable following the conclusion of each calendar year during the three-year Cycle, the Committee will determine the SCIU vesting and payout in respect of the applicable year. Except as provided below, to the extent the Committee determines that the SCIUs will become vested for that year, the number of SCIUs that will vest will equal the total number of SCIUs vesting for that year in the Cycle multiplied by the Unit Multiplier as determined by the Committee. Following vesting, you will receive a cash payout based on the vested SCIUs at the rate of one dollar per SCIU vested for that year.

 Performance Conditions 
 The vesting of the PSUs is conditioned upon the Company achieving financial performance measures pre-established by the Board and a relative total shareholder return modifier. 
 The pre-established metrics used to determine the number of PSUs that vest at the end of the cycle are XXXXX and XXXXX, for which the three-year targets are established at the beginning of each year within the PSU three-year cycle and are consistent with our Company s objectives, recommended by management and approved by the Board. XXXXX and XXXXX objectives are equally weighted and in aggregate the unit multiplier can range from 0.00 to 2.00, subject to the limitations imposed by the Plan. Therefore, the maximum number of PSUs that can vest is two times the target number of PSUs. In determining the maximum number of shares that can vest, all Plan limitations shall be imposed, including without limitation, the maximum number of shares that may be the subject of Awards made to a single individual in any one calendar year. 
 The award is also subject to a cumulative three-year Total Shareholder Return TSR modifier established by the Board which can increase or decrease the award by up to 25 depending on the Company s relative performance compared to that of a select list of companies over the same cumulative three-year period. The TSR modifier is determined based on a percentile ranking over the cycle s three-year period as compared to that of a select list of companies. If the Company s TSR is negative for the cumulative three-year period, there will be no positive application of the TSR modifier. Depending on performance and the application of the cumulative TSR modifier, anywhere from zero to 200 of the 

number of target PSUs awarded can vest, subject to the Plan limitations as provided herein. The payout shall not exceed the maximum allowable units provided to an individual per year as specified in the Plan. 
 In addition, the Board retains the prerogative of exercising negative discretion by taking into account the overall performance of the Company in determining the final vesting of a PSU award. 
 
 Rights of the Participant with Respect to the Performance Stock Units 
 The PSUs granted pursuant to this award do not and shall not entitle you to any rights of a shareholder of common stock. You shall not be entitled to receive dividend equivalents (cash payments equal to any cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to a corresponding number of shares of Company stock) nor shall you have voting rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to PSUs. 
 Vesting, Conversion of Performance Stock Units and Issuance of Common Stock 
 Except as provided below, PSUs will vest on the fourth Tuesday in February following the end of the three-year performance period. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the vesting date, determine the number of PSUs actually vesting and, subject to Board verification, convert the PSUs vesting into common shares after applying Plan rules. PSUs may be settled in shares or cash as the Committee may determine from time to time in its sole discretion. If you are eligible to defer the conversion of PSUs into common shares and have so elected before the award was made, the PSUs will be converted instead into vested restricted stock units following the vesting date. Upon settlement of the PSUs into common shares of Company stock, you will obtain full voting rights and will be entitled to receive cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to Company stock. If you elected deferral, you will be entitled to receive dividend equivalents (cash payments equal to any cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to a corresponding number of shares of Company stock) on your vested deferred PSUs but you will not be entitled to vote the shares underlying the PSUs. 
 Termination Provisions and Vesting of PSUs 
 The Plan either specifically provides or authorizes the Board to provide in this Award Agreement what happens in the event you terminate employment with the Company. Vesting, in all cases, is subject to first meeting any performance criteria set by the Board upon the making of the award. Except as provided below, unvested PSUs will be forfeited upon termination of employment. The following charts describe the more common events relevant to PSUs.

 RE Notice of Stock Cash Incentive Unit Award 
 
 STOCK CASH INCENTIVE UNIT AGREEMENT AGREEMENT 
 
 Congratulations on your 2024 long-term incentive award! Your long-term incentive (LTI) award is determined based on your performance and is made in recognition of your past and expected future efforts and contributions to Pitney Bowes, its subsidiaries and affiliates Company ). This Agreement details the terms and conditions applicable to your SCIU award. 
 The details of your SCIU award are described on the following pages. 
 About Your Stock Cash Incentive Unit (SCIU) Award 
 The dollar value of 100 of your LTI award has been converted into ### Num_SCIUs### SCIUs. SCIUs are a cash-based award that vests and settles based on the Company s stock price performance. You are granted one SCIU for each dollar of your LTI award allocated to SCIUs. The date of grant, number of SCIUs and vesting dates are specified below. Your SCIU grant will vest, if at all, in three approximately equal annual installments on vesting dates that will generally fall between February 1 and March 15 of the first three calendar years immediately following the calendar year of the award date, subject to achievement of the performance condition described below and your continued employment or service with the Company on each applicable vesting date. While the target value of each SCIU is one dollar, the ultimate payout is based on the extent of achievement of performance criteria with a maximum and minimum payout between 150 and 75 respectively, of the value of the initial number of SCIUs awarded. 
 The date of award, number of units that have been awarded and the vesting dates are specified below.

The average of the closing PBI stock price of the first 10 trading days of Year was X.XX . 
 
 ###VEST_SCHEDULE_TABLE### 
 
 Performance Conditions 
 The value of SCIUs that vest at the end of each vesting cycle is determined by applying a Unit Multiplier to the target value of the SCIUs vesting during such cycle. The amount of the Unit Multiplier will be based on the percentage change in the average of the closing PBI stock price over the first 10 trading days of the first year and the average of the closing PBI stock price over the last 10 trading days of the year ending immediately preceding the vest date. The minimum and maximum vested value of SCIUs in each performance cycle is between 75 and 150 , respectively, of the initial number of SCIU vesting in the applicable performance cycle. The payout shall not exceed the maximum allowable units provided to an individual per year as specified in the Key Employees Incentive Plan Plan ). Further details on the vesting of your SCIU award are provided in the section below. 

Vesting, Conversion of Stock Cash Incentive Units 
 Below is an overview of how the Unit Multipliers for each tranche of your SCIU award will be calculated 
 First Vesting (after the first calendar year) The percentage change in the average of the closing PBI stock price of the first 10 trading days of year one versus the average of the closing PBI stock price of the last 10 trading days of year one (limited by the 75 minimum and 150 maximum Unit Multiplier thresholds). 
 Second Vesting (after the second calendar year) The percentage change in the average of the closing PBI stock price of the first 10 trading days of year one versus the average of the closing PBI stock price of the last 10 trading days of year two (limited by the 75 minimum and 150 maximum Unit Multiplier thresholds). 
 Third Vesting (after the third calendar year) The percentage change in the average of the closing PBI stock price of the first 10 trading days of year one versus the average of the closing PBI stock price of the last 10 trading days of year three (limited by the 75 minimum and 150 maximum Unit Multiplier thresholds). 
 
 As soon as practicable following the conclusion of each calendar year during the three-year SCIU performance period, the Company will determine and the Board will verify the SCIU payout in respect of the applicable year. The value of the portion of your award vesting is determined by multiplying the total number of units vesting for the performance cycle times the Unit Multiplier. The Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reserves the right to exercise discretion on the SCIU Unit Multiplier value based on overall company performance, which could result in a reduction to the amount paid.
