Revenue 

Control of products we sell transfers to customers upon shipment from our facilities or delivery to our customers, and the Company s performance obligations are satisfied at that time. Shipping and handling activities are performed before the customer obtains control of the goods and therefore represent a fulfillment activity rather than promised goods to the customer. Payments for sales are generally made by check, credit card, or wire transfer. Historically the Company has not experienced any significant payment delays from customers. 

For direct-to-consumer sales, the Company allows for returns within 30 days of purchase. Our wholesale customers, such as GNC, may return purchased products to the Company under certain circumstances, which include expired or soon-to-be-expired products located in GNC corporate stores or at any of its distribution centers, and products that are subject to a recall or that contain an ingredient or ingredients that are subject to a recall by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ). 

A right of return does not represent a separate performance obligation, but because customers are allowed to return products, the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled is variable. Upon evaluation of returns, the Company determined that product returns are immaterial, and therefore believes it is probable that such returns will not cause a significant reversal of revenue in the future. We assess our contracts and the reasonableness of our conclusions on a quarterly basis. 

and of total net revenue, respectively. Net sales to GNC during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 represent and of total net revenue, respectively. Gross accounts receivable attributable to GNC represented and of the Company s total accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was one vendor that accounted for more than of the Company's consolidated accounts payable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were two vendors that each accounted for over of the Company s inventory-related purchases.

to months. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leased assets are presented as operating lease right-of-use assets and the related liabilities are presented as lease liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

As the Company uses the market approach to determine fair value of the reporting unit, the price of its Common Stock is an important component of the fair value calculation. If the Company s stock price experiences significant price fluctuations, this will impact the fair value of the reporting unit, which can lead to potential impairment in future periods. 

Management determined there were no indicators of impairment at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. The Company will perform its next impairment analysis in December 2024.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 , Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure ASC 280 , which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expense categories that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included in each reported measure of a segment s profit or loss. The update also requires all annual disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets to be provided in interim periods and for entities with a single reportable segment to provide all the disclosures required by ASC 280, including the significant segment expense disclosures. This standard became effective for the Company on January 1, 2024. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Revenue. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 15 to 15,977 as compared to 13,902 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period is primarily due to the acquisition of the MusclePharm assets, which were acquired on October 10, 2023, partially offset by a decline in Legacy FitLife revenue. 

Legacy FitLife revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 6,302, a 6 decrease compared to the previous year, driven by a 12 decline in wholesale revenue partially offset by a 4 increase in online revenue. 

MRC revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7,210, which was approximately flat compared to the previous year. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, MusclePharm generated revenue of 2,465, of which approximately half was generated from wholesale customers and half from online sales. 

Online revenue and wholesale revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 68 and 32 of total net revenue, respectively, consistent with the online and wholesale revenue percentages for the same period of 2023. 

Sales to customers in the U.S. were approximately 95 and 93 during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Canada. 

Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 8,976 as compared to 8,206 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This 9 increase is primarily due to an increase in revenue attributable to the acquisition of the MusclePharm assets, partially offset by lower Legacy FitLife sales. 

Gross Profit. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 7,001 as compared to 5,696 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit is attributable to higher gross profit from both MRC and Legacy FitLife as well as incremental gross profit from MusclePharm. 

Gross Margin . Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 43.8 from 41.0 for the comparable prior period. The increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to higher margins from both MRC and Legacy FitLife. 

Advertising and M arketing. Advertising and marketing expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 1,093 as compared to 1,275 for the same period of the prior year. The 14 decrease is the result of targeted efforts to rationalize the Company s advertising spend on less effective advertising campaigns. 

-16-

SG A. SG A expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 2,645 as compared to 1,897 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs (including salaries, benefits, and stock compensation) and higher professional fees. In addition, the Company incurred non-recurring severance costs of 184. 

Merger and A cquisition R elated. Merger and acquisition related expense increased to 59 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 32 for the same period of 2023. 

Net Income. We generated net income of 2,126 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net income of 1,696 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to incremental revenue and gross profit from MusclePharm, higher gross profit from MRC and Legacy FitLife, as well as reduced advertising and marketing expense.

Revenue. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 26 to 49,456 as compared to 39,401 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period is due to the acquisition of MRC and the MusclePharm assets, partially offset by a decline in Legacy FitLife revenue. MRC was acquired February 28, 2023, and as such only seven months of MRC revenue were included in the Company s financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. MusclePharm was acquired on October 10, 2023. 

Legacy FitLife revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 20,065, a 9 decrease compared to the previous year, driven by a 15 decline in wholesale revenue partially offset by a 5 increase in online revenue. 

MRC revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22,164. MRC revenue for the period from February 28, 2023 to September 30, 2023 was 17,468. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, MusclePharm generated revenue of 7,227, of which approximately half was generated from wholesale customers and half from online sales. 

Online revenue and wholesale revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 66 and 34 of total net revenue, respectively. Online revenue and wholesale revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were approximately 62 and 38 of net revenue, respectively. 

Sales to customers in the U.S. were approximately 96 and 94 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Canada. 

-17-

Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 27,588 as compared to 23,332 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This 18 increase is due to an increase in revenue attributable to the acquisitions of MRC and the MusclePharm assets. 

Gross Profit. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 21,868 as compared to 16,069 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit is principally attributable to higher MRC gross profit as well as incremental gross profit from MusclePharm. 

Gross Margin . Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 44.2 from 40.8 for the comparable prior period. The increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to higher margins from MRC and Legacy FitLife as well as the amortization of the fair value step-up to MRC inventory acquired in the first quarter of 2023. Excluding the 323 impact of the step-up amortization, gross margin would have been 41.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Advertising and M arketing. Advertising and marketing expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 3,647 as compared to 3,359 for the same period of the prior year. The 9 increase is primarily due to the full-period impact of MRC advertising and marketing as well as incremental advertising and marketing expense following the acquisition of the MusclePharm assets. 

SG A. SG A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 7,681 as compared to 5,399 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the full-period impact of MRC SG A as well as higher personnel costs (including salaries, benefits and stock compensation) and higher professional fees. In addition, the Company incurred non-recurring severance costs of 184. 

Merger and A cquisition R elated. Merger and acquisition related expense decreased to 217 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,519 for the same period of 2023, driven primarily by transaction costs related to the MRC acquisition in 2023. 

Net Income. We generated net income of 6,914 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net income of 3,816 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to higher revenue and gross profit for MRC, incremental revenue and gross profit from MusclePharm, as well as a reduction in acquisition-related expense due to the MRC acquisition that closed during 2023, partially offset by incremental SG A expense. 

Supplemental Discussion of Performance of Acquired Brands 

Management frequently receives questions from investors regarding the performance of brands subsequent to their acquisition by the Company. In an effort to be responsive to these questions, the Company is providing additional disclosure herein. Management intends to provide this level of disclosure for no more than two years following a transaction, after which the performance of acquired brands will be reported as part of Legacy FitLife results. 

One of the primary metrics used by management to evaluate the performance of the Company s brands is contribution, a non-GAAP financial measure which management defines as gross profit less advertising and marketing expenditures. Other companies may also report contribution as a performance metric, but their definition or calculation of contribution may differ from the Company s. Management believes that contribution, as defined by the Company, is a particularly relevant performance metric since it incorporates the gross profit associated with a specific brand or collection of brands as well as the advertising and marketing expenditures associated with the same brand or brands. With limited exceptions, other operating expenses incurred by the Company are generally not allocable to a specific brand or collection of brands. 

-18-

Other than for MusclePharm, the numbers in the contribution tables presented below represent the performance of a collection of brands. Legacy FitLife consists of nine brands and MRC consists of three brands. These collections of brands do not meet the definition of operating segments and are not managed as such.

For the third quarter of 2024, Legacy FitLife revenue declined 6 compared to the same period last year, driven by a 12 decline in wholesale revenue partially offset by a 4 increase in online revenue. 

Despite the revenue decline, gross profit and contribution for Legacy FitLife increased. Gross margin increased from 37.2 during the third quarter of 2023 to 42.6 during the third quarter of 2024. Contribution as a percentage of revenue increased from 36.0 to 41.5 over the same time period. 

The Company s wholesale revenue continues to be challenged by declining customer counts in the brick-and-mortar stores of our wholesale partners. However, at least some of the customers choosing to no longer shop in brick-and-mortar locations continue to purchase Legacy FitLife products online, and when a customer buys online the Company earns substantially higher gross profit and contribution.

For the third quarter of 2024, MRC revenue was consistent with the same period in 2023. Over the same time period, gross profit increased 7 and contribution increased 25 . 

For the third quarter of 2024, gross margin increased to 47.7 from 44.5 last year.

Revenue for the largest MRC brand, Dr. Tobias, increased 6 in the third quarter of 2024 while revenue for the skin care brands, Maritime Naturals and All Natural Advice, declined 33 in the same period compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

At the time of the MRC acquisition in 2023, the skin care brands were sold in a number of countries. Analysis subsequent to the acquisition determined that, in almost all countries other than Canada and the U.S., the products were being sold at levels resulting in negative contribution. Even worse, in many of those countries, the products were being sold at negative gross margins. 

To optimize performance of the skin care brands, management exited a number of countries and raised prices in other countries. As a result of these changes, a substantial amount of unprofitable revenue was eliminated. 

The substantial year-over-year increase in gross profit for the MRC brands is primarily the result of this optimization of the skin care brands as well as beneficial product mix within the Dr. Tobias brand. The substantial year-over-year increase in contribution for the MRC brands is a function of the optimization of the skin care brands, beneficial product mix within the Dr. Tobias brand, as well as the optimization of advertising spend across all MRC brands.

MusclePharm revenue decreased 8 sequentially from the second quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2024, with wholesale revenue decreasing 11 and online revenue decreasing 4 . This slower movement is due in part to normal seasonality of sales as well as timing of customer orders in the wholesale channel. 

In an effort to drive revenue growth, the Company is making targeted investments in advertising and promotion in both the wholesale and online channels. As a result of these investments, gross margin and contribution margin as a percent of revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. 

In addition, the Company is exploring additional new product launches and continues to have productive discussions with a number of potential new wholesale partners.

Non-GAAP Measures 

The financial presentation below contains certain financial measures not in accordance with GAAP, defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures , including non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA and adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in this Quarterly Report in accordance with GAAP. 

As presented below, non-GAAP EBITDA excludes interest, foreign exchange gains and losses, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA excludes, in addition to interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, merger and acquisition related expense and non-recurring expense. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expense and other items that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. The Company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures in the financial presentation below allows investors to compare the Company s financial results with the Company s historical financial results and is an important measure of the Company s comparative financial performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had positive working capital of 6,044, compared to 4,356 at December 31, 2023. Our principal sources of liquidity at September 30, 2024 consisted of 4,720 of cash and 2,008 of accounts receivable. The increase in working capital is principally attributable to positive operating cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by a voluntary paydown of 2,500 on the Term Loans as well as the three scheduled amortization payments totaling 3,375. 

On September 24, 2019, the Company entered into a line of credit agreement with Mutual of Omaha Bank (the Lender ), subsequently acquired by CIT Bank N.A., then acquired by First Citizens Bank Trust Company, providing the Company with a 2.5 million revolving line of credit (the Line of Credit ). The Line of Credit allows the Company to request advances thereunder and to use the proceeds of such advances for working capital purposes until the maturity date, or unless renewed at maturity upon approval by the Company s Board and the Lender. The Line of Credit is secured by all assets of the Company. 

Advances drawn under the Line of Credit bear interest at an annual rate of the one-month SOFR rate plus 2.75 , and each advance will be payable on the maturity date with the interest on outstanding advances payable monthly. The Company may, at its option, prepay any borrowings under the Line of Credit, in whole or in part at any time prior to the maturity date, without premium or penalty. On September 20, 2022, the Company and the Lender amended the Line of Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date to December 23, 2022. On December 19, 2022, the Company and the Lender amended the Line of Credit agreement to increase the Line of Credit to 3.5 million and extend the maturity date to December 23, 2023. 

On February 23, 2023, the Company and the Lender amended the Line of Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement providing the Company with a term loan for the principal amount of 12.5 million Term Loan A ). All other terms of the Credit Agreement remain unchanged. All of the proceeds from Term Loan A were used for the acquisition of MRC. 

On October 10, 2023, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement with the Lender, amending and restating the Credit Agreement between the Company and the Lender. Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, the Lender provided the Company with an additional term loan Term Loan B , and together with Term Loan A, the Term Loans for the principal amount of 10,000 and extended the Line of Credit of 3.5 million to December 15, 2024. The Company used the proceeds from Term Loan B to fund the acquisition of the MusclePharm assets. 

The Term Loans accrue interest at an annual rate of the one-month SOFR rate plus 2.75 , and principal plus accrued interest will be payable quarterly beginning June 10, 2023 in amounts sufficient to fully amortize the Term Loans through February 28, 2028 in the case of Term Loan A and through October 10, 2028 in the case of Term Loan B. The Company may prepay amounts borrowed under the Term Loans, in whole or in part with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid, by written notice to the Lender at least one business day prior to the proposed prepayment. 

The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default (each an Event of Default ), which upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, among other things, interest will accrue at the applicable rate plus 2 per annum, and the Lender may declare all obligations, with interest thereon, immediately due and payable. The Amended Credit Agreement further contains customary representations and warranties of the Company; customary indemnification provisions whereby the Company will indemnify Lender for certain losses arising out of inaccuracies in, or breaches of, the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, and certain other matters; and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.25 to 1.00 as tested quarterly on a trailing twelve-month basis, starting with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023, a Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of not more than 2.50 to 1.00 as tested quarterly on a trailing twelve-month basis, starting with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2024, and to the extent the Term Loans still have a balance as of June 30, 2025 and a Cash Flow Leverage threshold (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of at least 1.15 is not met, the Company will be required to make a prepayment on the Term Loans equal to 50 of the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. 

-22-

As of September 30, 2024, the borrowings outstanding on the Term Loans and the Line of Credit were 14,250 and 0, respectively. 

The Company has historically financed its operations primarily through cash flow from operations and equity and debt financings. The Company currently anticipates that cash derived from operations and existing cash reserves, along with available borrowings under the Line of Credit, will be sufficient to provide for the Company s liquidity for the next twelve months. 

The Company is dependent on cash flow from operations and amounts available under the Line of Credit to satisfy its working capital requirements. No assurances can be given that cash flow from operations and/or the Line of Credit will be sufficient to provide for the Company s liquidity for the next twelve months. Should the Company be unable to generate sufficient revenue in the future to achieve positive cash flow from operations, and/or should capital be unavailable under the terms of the Line of Credit, additional working capital will be required. Management currently has no intention to raise additional working capital through the sale of equity or debt securities and believes that the cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the Line of Credit will provide sufficient capital necessary to operate the business over the next twelve months. In the event the Company fails to achieve positive cash flow from operations, additional capital is unavailable under the terms of the Line of Credit, and management is otherwise unable to secure additional working capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities, the Company s business would be materially and adversely harmed. 

Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8,653, as compared to cash provided by operations of 2,772 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the higher net income achieved in the first nine months of 2024 which was driven by the acquisitions of MRC and the MusclePharm assets, as well as the payment of the transaction-related costs and other payables and expenses that were accrued at MRC at the time the Company acquired MRC in 2023. 

Cash Used in Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 10 and 18,984, respectively. The Company used 10 and 60 for purchases of property and equipment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Company paid 17,099 to acquire MRC and had paid a deposit towards the acquisition of the MusclePharm assets. 

Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5,875 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 11,250 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expense, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate, on an on-going basis, our estimates and judgments, including those related to the useful life of the assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our condensed consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time of estimation. For a more detailed discussion of the accounting policies of the Company, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . 

-23-

We believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and (iii) the reported amount of net sales and expense recognized during the periods presented. 

Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts receivable, allowance for inventory obsolescence, product returns, depreciable lives of property and equipment, allocation of purchase price from business combinations, analysis of impairment of goodwill, realization of deferred tax assets, accruals for potential liabilities and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Goodwill and Intangibles 

In accordance with FASB ASC 350 , Intangibles-Goodwill and Other , we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Our impairment testing is performed annually at December 31 (our fiscal year end). Impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is determined by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities. 

Management concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We will continue to review for impairment indicators as necessary in future periods. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company s revenue is comprised of sales of nutritional supplements and wellness products to consumers. 

The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606. The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contract(s), which includes (1) identifying the contract(s) or agreement(s) with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs for the Company upon shipment or delivery of products to our customers based on written sales terms. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring the products to a customer. 

All products sold by the Company are distinct individual products and consist of nutritional supplements and wellness products. The products are offered for sale solely as finished goods, and there are no performance obligations required post-shipment for customers to derive the expected value from them. 

The Company s products are also sold on e-commerce platforms including Amazon. For these transactions, the Company evaluated principal versus agent considerations to determine appropriateness of recording distribution and platform fees paid to third-party e-commerce companies as an expense or as a reduction of revenue. The Company records distribution and platform fees to cost of goods sold in the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Distribution and platform fees are not recorded as a reduction of revenue because the Company (1) owns the goods before they are transferred to the customer, (2) can direct Amazon, similar to other third-party logistics providers Logistic Providers ), to return the Company s inventory to any location specified by the Company, (3) has the responsibility to make customers whole following any returns made by customers directly to Logistic Providers and the Company retains the back-end inventory risk, (4) is subject to credit risk (i.e., credit card chargebacks), (5) establishes prices of its products, (6) can determine who fulfills the goods to the customer (Amazon or the Company) and (7) can limit quantities or stop selling the goods at any time. Based on these considerations, the Company is the principal in this arrangement. Advertising fees for Amazon are recorded in advertising and marketing expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. 

-24-

The Company disaggregates revenue into geographical regions and distribution channels. The Company determines that disaggregating revenue into these categories achieves the disclosure objective to depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. 

Online revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 68 of net revenue for both periods, compared to 32 for the wholesale channel for the same periods. 

Online revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 66 and 62 of net revenue, compared to 34 and 38 for the wholesale channel for the same period. 

Sales to customers in the U.S. were approximately 95 and 93 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the balance of sales for the same respective periods being to customers primarily in Canada. 

Sales to customers in the U.S. were approximately 96 and 94 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the balance of sales for the same respective periods being to customers primarily in Canada. 

Control of products we sell transfers to customers upon shipment from our facilities or delivery to our customers, and the Company s performance obligations are satisfied at that time. Shipping and handling activities are performed before the customer obtains control of the goods and therefore represent a fulfillment activity rather than promised goods to the customer. Payments for sales are generally made by check, credit card, or wire transfer. Historically the Company has not experienced any significant payment delays from customers. 

For direct-to-consumer sales, the Company allows for returns within 30 days of purchase. Our wholesale customers, such as GNC, may return purchased products to the Company under certain circumstances, which include expired or soon-to-be-expired products located in GNC corporate stores or at any of its distribution centers, and products that are subject to a recall or that contain an ingredient or ingredients that are subject to a recall by the FDA. 

A right of return does not represent a separate performance obligation, but because customers are allowed to return products, the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled is variable. Upon evaluation of returns, the Company determined that product returns are immaterial, and therefore believes it is probable that such returns will not cause a significant reversal of revenue in the future. We assess our contracts and the reasonableness of our conclusions on a quarterly basis. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 3 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements believed by management to have a material impact on our present or future financial statements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our business is conducted principally in the U.S. However, due to the MRC acquisition in 2023, the Company now has more exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies. As a result, our financial results may be materially affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets. 

Foreign Currency 

In January 2023, the Company entered into a foreign currency hedging transaction to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in the USD/CAD exchange rate with respect to the pending acquisition of MRC. The Company entered into a forward contract to purchase CAD 25.0 million, as the Company anticipated providing additional working capital funding beyond the CAD 23.2 million purchase price for MRC. As the geographical scope of our business broadens, we may engage in additional foreign currency hedging transactions in the future. The Company has not entered into any foreign currency hedging transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

-25-

Interest Rates 

Our exposure to risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement (which includes the Term Loans as well as our Line of Credit), and our investments in short-term financial instruments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 14,250 outstanding on the Term Loans and 0 under its Line of Credit. 

Investments of our cash balances in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry some interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may fall due to a rise in interest rates, while floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Partly as a result of this, our future interest income will vary due to changes in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have fallen in estimated fair value due to changes in interest rates. However, as substantially all of our cash equivalents consist of bank deposits and short-term money market instruments, we do not expect any material change with respect to our net income as a result of an interest rate change. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

a. 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " Exchange Act "), as of September 30, 2024 was completed. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer believe that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

b. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no additional changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

c. 

Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 

These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

-26-

PART II 

 OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We currently are not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting the Company, our Common Stock, any of our subsidiaries or of the Company s or our subsidiaries directors or officers in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties described in our comprehensive Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. Management is not aware of any material changes to the risk factors discussed in Part 1, Item 1A, of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. You should carefully consider these risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this Quarterly Report. Should any of these risks materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

None.
