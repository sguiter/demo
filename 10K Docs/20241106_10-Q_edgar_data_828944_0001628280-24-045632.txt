 Interchange fees Other card and ATM fees Total credit/debit card and ATM income 
 Credit/debit card and ATM income is composed of bailment fees, interchange fees, and other card and ATM fees. Bailment fees are earned from bailment arrangements with customers. Bailment arrangements are legal relationships in which property is delivered to another party without a transfer of ownership. The party who transferred the property (the bailor) retains ownership interest of the property. In the event that the bailee files for bankruptcy protection, the property is not included in the bailee's assets. The bailee pays an agreed-upon fee for the use of the bailor's property in exchange for the bailor allowing use of the assets at the bailee's site. Bailment fees are earned from cash that is made available for customers' use at an offsite location, such as cash located in an ATM at a customer's place of business. These fees are typically indexed to a market interest rate. This revenue stream generates fee income through monthly billing for bailment services. 
 Credit/debit card and ATM income also includes interchange fees. Interchange fees are paid by a merchant's bank to a bank that issued a debit or credit card used in a transaction to compensate the issuing bank for the value and benefit the merchant receives from accepting electronic payments. These revenue streams generate fee income at the time a transaction occurs and are recorded as revenue at the time of the transaction. 
 Investment management and fiduciary income 
 Wealth management and advisory fees Total investment management and fiduciary income 
 Investment management and fiduciary income is composed of trust fees and wealth management and advisory fees. Trust fees are based on revenue earned from custody, escrow, trustee and trustee related services on structured finance transactions; indenture trustee, administrative agent and collateral agent services to individuals, institutions and corporations; commercial domicile and independent director services; and investment and trustee services to families and individuals. Most fees are flat fees, except for a portion of personal and corporate trustee fees where the Company earns a percentage on the assets under management or assets held within a trust. This revenue stream primarily generates fee income through monthly, quarterly and annual billings for services provided. 
 Wealth management and advisory fees consists of fees from Bryn Mawr Trust (excluding BMT-DE), BMCM, Powdermill , and WSFS Wealth Investments. Wealth management and advisory fees are based on revenue earned from services including asset management, financial planning, family office, and brokerage. The fees are based on the market value of assets, are assessed as a flat fee, or are brokerage commissions. This revenue stream primarily generates fee income through monthly, quarterly and annual billings for the services.

 Return and overdraft fees Other deposit service fees Total deposit service charges 
 Deposit service charges includes revenue earned from core deposit products, certificates of deposit, and brokered deposits. The Company generates fee revenues from deposit service charges primarily through service charges and overdraft fees. Service charges consist primarily of monthly account maintenance fees, treasury management fees, foreign ATM fees and other maintenance fees. All of these revenue streams generate fee income through service charges for monthly account maintenance and similar items, transfer fees, late fees, overlimit fees, and stop payment fees. Revenue is recorded at the time of the transaction. 
 Other income 
 Currency preparation ATM loss protection Capital markets revenue Miscellaneous products and services Total other income 
 Other income consists of managed service fees, which are primarily courier fees related to treasury management and are partially offset in noninterest expense, currency preparation, ATM loss protection, capital markets revenue, and other miscellaneous products and services offered by the Bank. These fees are primarily generated through monthly billings or at the time of the transaction. Capital markets revenue consists of fees related to interest rate swaps, risk participation agreements, foreign exchange contracts, letters of credit, and trade finance products and services offered by the Bank. 
 Arrangements with multiple performance obligations 
 The Company's contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers. 
 Practical expedients and exemptions 
 The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.

 The Company does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not it will be required to sell these securities before it is able to recover the amortized cost basis. The unrealized losses are the result of changes in market interest rates subsequent to purchase, not credit loss, as these are highly rated agency securities with no expected credit loss, in the event of a default.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 Below is a description of each of the risk ratings for all commercial loans: 
 
 Pass . These borrowers currently show no indication of deterioration or potential problems and their loans are considered fully collectible. 
 Special Mention. These borrowers have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. Borrowers in this category may be experiencing adverse operating trends, for example, declining revenues or margins, high leverage, tight liquidity, or increasing inventory without increasing sales. These adverse trends can have a potential negative effect on the borrower s repayment capacity. These assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the Bank to significant risk that would warrant a more severe rating. Borrowers in this category may also be experiencing significant management problems, pending litigation, or other structural credit weaknesses. 
 Substandard or Lower . These borrowers have well-defined weaknesses that require extensive oversight by management. Borrowers in this category may exhibit one or more of the following: inadequate debt service coverage, unprofitable operations, insufficient liquidity, high leverage, and weak or inadequate capitalization. Relationships in this category are not adequately protected by the sound financial worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged on the loan, if any. A distinct possibility exists that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. In addition, some borrowers in this category could have the added characteristic that the possibility of loss is extremely high. Current circumstances in the credit relationship make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable. Such impending events include: perfecting liens on additional collateral, obtaining collateral valuations, an acquisition or liquidation preceding, proposed merger, or refinancing plan. 
 Residential and Consumer Loans 
 The residential and consumer loan portfolios are monitored on an ongoing basis using delinquency information and loan type as credit quality indicators. These credit quality indicators are assessed in the aggregate in these relatively homogeneous portfolios. Loans that are greater than days past due are generally considered nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual status.

 interest rate floors purchased at an aggregate premium of million with an aggregate notional amount of billion to hedge variable cash flows associated with a variable rate loan pool through the third quarter of 2027. Changes to the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecast transaction affects earnings. If the Company determines that a cash flow hedge is no longer highly effective, future changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument would be reported in earnings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined the cash flow hedges remain highly effective. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, million and million, respectively, of amortization expense on the premium was reclassified into interest income compared to million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company does not expect any unrealized gains or losses related to cash flow hedges to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months. 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments: 
 Customer Derivatives Interest Rate Swaps 
 The Company enters into interest rate swaps with commercial loan customers wishing to manage interest rate risk. The Company then enters into corresponding swap agreements with swap dealer counterparties to economically hedge the exposure arising from these contracts. The interest rate swaps with both the customers and third parties are not designated as hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815) and are marked to market through earnings. As the interest rate swaps are structured to offset each other, changes to the underlying benchmark interest rates considered in the valuation of these instruments do not result in an impact to earnings; however, there may be fair value adjustments related to credit quality variations between counterparties, which may impact earnings as required by ASC 820. As of September 30, 2024, there were no fair value adjustments related to credit quality. 
 Derivative Financial Instruments from Mortgage Banking Activities 
 Derivative financial instruments related to mortgage banking activities are recorded at fair value and are not designated as accounting hedges. This includes commitments to originate certain fixed-rate residential mortgage loans to customers, also referred to as interest rate lock commitments. The Company may also enter into forward sale commitments to sell loans to investors at a fixed price at a future date and trade asset-backed securities to mitigate interest rate risk. 
 Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts 
 The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards) with customers to exchange one currency for another on an agreed date in the future at an agreed exchange rate. The Corporation then enters into corresponding FX forwards with swap dealer counterparties to economically hedge its exposure on the exchange rate component of the customer agreements. The FX forwards with both the customers and third parties are not designated as hedges under ASC 815 and are marked to market through earnings. Exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate. As the FX forwards are structured to offset each other, changes to the underlying term structure of currency exchange rates considered in the valuation of these instruments do not result in an impact to earnings; however, there may be fair value adjustments related to credit quality variations between counterparties, which may impact earnings as required by ASC 820. As of September 30, 2024, there were no fair value adjustments related to credit quality.

 unrelated financial institution whereby that financial institution entered into interest rate derivative contracts (interest rate swap transactions) directly with customers referred to them by the Company. Under the terms of the agreements, the financial institution has recourse to us for any exposure created under each swap transaction, only in the event that the customer defaults on the swap agreement and the agreement is in a paying position to the third-party financial institution. This is a customary arrangement that allows us to provide access to interest rate swap transactions for our customers without creating the swap ourselves. These swap guarantees are accounted for as credit derivatives. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were and variable-rate to fixed-rate swap transactions between the third-party financial institutions and the Company's customers, respectively. The initial notional aggregate amount was approximately billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the swap transactions remaining maturities ranged from under year to years. At September 30, 2024, of these customer swaps was in a paying position to third parties for less than million, with our swap guarantees having a fair value of million. At December 31, 2023, of these customer swaps were in a paying position to third parties, with the Company's swap guarantees having a fair value of million. For both periods, none of the Company's customers were in default of the swap agreements. 
 Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
 The Company has agreements with certain derivative counterparties that contain a provision under which, if it defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. 
 The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties, and has posted collateral of million in cash against its obligations under these agreements which meets or exceeds the minimum collateral posting requirements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2024, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Total assets increased 310.5 million to 20.9 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. This increase is primarily comprised of the following: 
 Net loans and leases held for investment increased 541.5 million, primarily due to increases of 125.9 million in consumer loans primarily from Spring EQ home equity loans, 117.6 million in owner-occupied commercial loans, 99.2 million in commercial and industrial loans and 70.1 million in residential mortgage loans. Commercial mortgages increased 347.9 million with a corresponding decrease of 229.7 million in construction due to the migration of construction loans to permanent commercial mortgages. 
 Total investment securities decreased 141.7 million: 
 Investment securities, available-for-sale decreased 109.4 million, primarily due to repayments, maturities and calls of 262.8 million, partially offset by increased market values of 104.1 million and purchases of 51.6 million. 
 Investment securities, held-to-maturity decreased 32.3 million, primarily due to repayments, maturities and calls of 45.8 million, partially offset by 11.2 million of amortization of net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities transferred to held-to-maturity. 
 Total cash and cash equivalents decreased 102.0 million, due to loan growth and a shift to external funding sources in our Cash Connect business, partially offset by an increase in wholesale funding. 
 Total liabilities increased 113.3 million to 18.2 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. This increase is primarily comprised of the following: 
 Other borrowed funds increased 136.6 million, primarily due to 135.0 million borrowed from the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) as a result of favorable terms and pricing. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased 43.2 million due to favorable pricing terms. 
 Accrued interest payable increased 26.7 million due to the timing of interest payments on BTFP borrowings. 
 Brokered deposits decreased 51.7 million due to a shift in funding sources. 
 Other liabilities decreased 46.4 million, primarily due to a decrease of 54.4 million in collateral held on derivatives and derivative liabilities, partially offset by an increase of 5.7 million in our lease liabilities related to new leases and extensions. 
 For further information, see "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited). 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Capital Resources 
 Stockholders equity of WSFS increased 200.6 million between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to 199.5 million of earnings and a decrease of 94.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss driven by market value increases on available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by 74.5 million from the repurchase of shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan and the payment of dividends on our common stock of 27.0 million. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0.15 per share of common stock. This dividend will be paid on November 22, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 8, 2024. 
 Book value per share of common stock was 45.37 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.44 from 40.93 at December 31, 2023. Tangible book value per share of common stock (a non-GAAP financial measure) was 28.56 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.23 from 24.33 at December 31, 2023. We believe tangible book value per common share helps management and investors better understand and assess changes from period to period in stockholders equity exclusive of changes in intangible assets. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (GAAP), and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. For a reconciliation of tangible book value per common share to book value per share in accordance with GAAP, see "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measure to GAAP Measure."

 Under the prompt corrective action regime, regulators have established five capital tiers: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized. A depository institution s capital tier depends on its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures, which include leverage and risk-based capital measures and certain other factors. Depository institutions that are not classified as well-capitalized are subject to various restrictions, which may include restrictions on capital distributions, payment of management fees, acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities. 
 Regulatory capital requirements for the Bank and the Company include a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50 of risk-weighted assets, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.00 of risk-weighted assets, a minimum total capital ratio of 8.00 of risk-weighted assets and a minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 4.00 of average assets. In order to avoid limits on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Bank and the Company must maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital over each of the risk-based capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank and the Company were in compliance with the regulatory capital requirements and met or exceeded the amounts required to be considered well-capitalized as defined in the regulations. 
 Not included in the Bank s capital, WSFS separately held 307.4 million in cash to support share repurchases, potential dividends, acquisitions, strategic growth plans and other general corporate purposes.

 Liquidity 
 We manage our liquidity and funding needs through our Treasury function and our Asset/Liability Committee. We have a policy that separately addresses liquidity, and management monitors our adherence to policy limits. Also, liquidity risk management is a primary area of examination by the banking regulators. 
 Funding sources to support growth and meet our liquidity needs include cash from operations, commercial, consumer, wealth and trust deposits, loan repayments, FHLB borrowings, repurchase agreements, access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window, and access to the brokered deposit market as well as other wholesale funding avenues. In addition, we have a large portfolio of high-quality, liquid investments, primarily short-duration mortgage-backed securities, that provide a near-continuous source of cash flow to meet current cash needs, or can be sold to meet larger discrete needs for cash. We believe these sources are sufficient to meet our funding needs as well as maintain required and prudent levels of liquidity over the next twelve months and beyond. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 1.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. As of September 30, 2024, our estimated uninsured deposits were 6.1 billion, or 37 of total customer deposits, and our estimated unprotected deposits (uninsured and uncollateralized) were 4.9 billion, or 30 of total customer deposits. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a readily available, secured borrowing capacity of 5.6 billion from the FHLB and 2.0 billion through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. In addition, the Company had 1.4 billion in unpledged securities that could be used to support additional borrowings and 0.3 billion of cash deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 Our primary cash contractual obligations relate to operating leases, long-term debt, credit obligations, and data processing. At September 30, 2024, we had 219.9 million in total contractual payments for ongoing leases that have remaining lease terms of less than one year to 21 years, which includes renewal options that are exercised at our discretion. For additional information on our operating leases, see Note 8 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. At September 30, 2024, we had obligations for principal payments on long-term debt including 43.2 million of FHLB advances, 67.0 million for our trust preferred borrowings, due June 1, 2035, 70.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2027, and 150.0 million for our senior debt, due December 15, 2030. At September 30, 2024, we had advances of 700.0 million under the BTFP, due January 2025. On October 11, 2024 and October 18, 2024, WSFS Bank executed repayments of advances under the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) totaling 700.0 million of principal and 25.1 million of accrued interest. Royal Bancshares Capital Trust I (Trust I) and Royal Bancshares Capital Trust II (Trust II) (collectively, the RBC Trusts), which were acquired from Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation, were utilized for the sole purpose of issuing and selling capital securities representing preferred beneficial interests. Although WSFS owns an aggregate of 0.8 million of the common securities of Trust I and Trust II, the RBC Trusts are not consolidated into the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. Inclusive of the fair value marks, WSFS assumed junior subordinated debentures owed to the RBC Trusts with a current carrying value of 11.9 million each, totaling 23.8 million. The Company records its investments in the RBC Trusts common securities of 0.4 million each as investments in unconsolidated entities and records dividend income upon declaration by Trust I and Trust II. The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the obligations of the RBC Trusts, including any distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption of the capital securities. We are also contractually obligated to make interest payments on our long-term debt through their respective maturities. 
 Commitments to extend credit provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the customer continues to meet specific criteria. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total commitments to extend credit of 4.1 billion, which are generally one year commitments.

 NONPERFORMING ASSETS 
 Nonperforming assets include nonaccruing loans, OREO and restructured loans. Nonaccruing loans are those on which we no longer accrue interest. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if, in the opinion of management, collection is doubtful, or when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest. Interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income. In addition, the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal and interest. Past due loans are defined as loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because they are considered well secured and in the process of collection. 
 The following table shows our nonperforming assets and past due loans at the dates indicated:

 Nonperforming assets increased 15.6 million between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 . This increase was primarily driven by the addition of two C I relationships during the third quarter, partially offset by favorable resolutions and paydowns of multiple loans during the year and a charge-off on a commercial mortgage relationship . The ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets increased from 0.37 at December 31, 2023 to 0.44 at September 30, 2024.

 The timely identification of problem loans is a key element in our strategy to manage our loan portfolio. Problem loans are all criticized, classified and nonperforming loans and other real estate owned. Timely identification enables us to take appropriate action and accordingly, minimize losses. An asset review system established to monitor the asset quality of our loans and investments in real estate portfolios facilitates the identification of problem assets. In general, this system uses guidelines established by federal regulation.

 INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY 
 Our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital, while maximizing the yield/cost spread on our asset/liability structure. Interest rates are partly a function of decisions by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on the target range for the federal funds rate, and these decisions are sometimes difficult to anticipate. The FOMC lowered the federal funds target rate once in 2024 for a total of 50 basis points and increased the target rate four times in 2023 for a total of 100 basis points, and has suggested it may continue lowering interest rates further in 2024. In order to manage the risks associated with changes or possible changes in interest rates, we rely primarily on our asset/liability structure. 
 Our primary tool for achieving our asset/liability management strategies is to match maturities or repricing periods of interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities to promote a favorable interest rate spread and mitigate exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. We regularly review our interest rate sensitivity and adjust the sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges. At September 30, 2024, interest-bearing liabilities exceeded interest-earning assets that mature or reprice within one year (interest-sensitive gap) by 162.4 million. Our interest-sensitive assets as a percentage of interest-sensitive liabilities within the one-year window was 98.25 at September 30, 2024 compared with 99.67 at December 31, 2023. Likewise, the one-year interest-sensitive gap as a percentage of total assets was (0.78) at September 30, 2024 compared with (0.14) at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending, investing, and funding activities. To that end, we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure. One measure evaluates the impact of an immediate change in interest rates in 100 basis point increments on the economic value of equity ratio. The economic value of the equity ratio is defined as the economic value of the estimated cash flows from assets and liabilities as a percentage of economic value of cash flows from total assets. 
 The following table shows the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and economic value of equity ratio at the specified levels at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 We also engage in other business activities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For example, mortgage banking revenues and expenses can fluctuate with changing interest rates. These fluctuations are difficult to model and estimate.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024: Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 64.4 million, compared to 74.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net interest income decreased 5.1 million, primarily due to continued deposit mix shift and growth in higher priced deposit products over the past year. See Net Interest Income for further information. 
 Our provision for credit losses was flat. See Allowance for Credit Losses for further information. 
 Noninterest income increased 17.5 million, driven by the Cash Connect , Wealth Management, Core Banking, and Mortgage business lines. Growth in Cash Connect was driven by bailment Customers added in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first half of 2024. Growth in Wealth Management was driven by growth across all key product lines. We also recognized revenue from our partnership with Spring EQ. See Noninterest Income for further information. 
 Noninterest expense increased 24.0 million, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits from annual performance-based increases and talent additions in key business lines and Cash Connect funding costs associated with a shift towards external funding. 
 Income tax provision decreased 1.8 million, primarily due to the 11.7 million decrease in pre-tax income, partially offset by higher state income taxes. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024: Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 199.5 million, compared to 205.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net interest income decreased 19.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the reasons described above. See Net Interest Income for further information. 
 Our provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 9.9 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower losses within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio and our residential and consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by higher losses on our commercial mortgages and commercial small business leases portfolios. See Allowance for Credit Losses for further information. 
 Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 54.9 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases from Cash Connect , Wealth Management fee income, revenue from our partnership with Spring EQ, a gain on our Visa B derivative liability, mortgage banking activities, and capital markets income. See Noninterest Income for further information. 
 Noninterest expense increased 54.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in Cash Connect funding costs associated with a shift towards external funding and salaries and benefits from annual performance-based increases and talent additions in key business lines. The increase was partially offset by decreases in net corporate development and restructuring costs. 
 Income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3.3 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the benefit from our low-income housing tax credit investments, solar tax credit investments and research and development tax credits.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024: During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased 5.1 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to continued deposit mix shift and growth in higher priced deposit products . Net interest margin was 3.78 for the third quarter of 2024, a 30 basis point decrease compared to 4.08 for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an unfavorable decrease of 45 basis points from deposit mix shift and growth in higher priced deposit products, partially offset by an increase of 17 basis points from our loan yields. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased 19.7 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the reasons noted above. Net interest margin was 3.82 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 33 basis point decrease compared to 4.15 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a 64 basis point decrease from the mix shift and growth in higher yielding products mentioned above, partially offset by a 35 basis point increase from our loan yields. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 We maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level based on our assessment of estimable and expected losses in the loan portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses is based on our historical loss experience that includes the inherent risk of our loans and various other factors including but not limited to, collateral values, trends in asset quality, level of delinquent loans and concentrations. Further, regional and national economic forecasts are considered in our expected credit losses. Our evaluation is based on a review of the portfolio and requires significant, complex and difficult judgments. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 18.4 million, which was flat compared to the provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 53.4 million, a decrease of 9.9 million, compared to the provision for credit losses of 63.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower losses within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio and our residential and consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by higher losses on our commercial mortgages and commercial small business leases portfolios. 
 The allowance for credit losses increased to 197.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 186.1 million at December 31, 2023. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans and leases was 1.48 at September 30, 2024 and 1.46 at December 31, 2023.

 Noninterest Income 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024: During the three months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income was 90.2 million, an increase of 17.5 million from 72.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The growth was driven by the Cash Connect , Wealth Management, Core Banking, and Mortgage business lines. Growth in Cash Connect of 10.6 million was driven by the addition of bailment Customers during the fourth quarter of 2023 and first half of 2024. Growth in Wealth Management of 3.4 million was driven by growth across all key product lines. We also recognized 2.3 million in revenue from our partnership with Spring EQ related to the annual earnout form the previously announced sale. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income was 257.6 million, an increase of 54.9 million from 202.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by 29.8 million from Cash Connect due to the reason mentioned above, 11.1 million in Wealth Management fees, 4.3 million from our partnership with Spring EQ, comprised of the 2.3 million annual earnout mentioned above and post-close distributions of 2.0 million, a 2.7 million net gain on our Visa B derivative liability established from our previous sale of 360,000 shares in 2Q 2020, 2.3 million from mortgage banking activities, and 2.0 million in capital markets income. 
 For further information, see Note 3 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Noninterest Expense 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 : During the three months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was 163.7 million, an increase of 24.0 million from 139.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 11.7 million from salaries and benefits from annual and performance-based increases and talent additions in key business lines and 9.3 million from other operating expense driven by higher funding costs from Cash Connect due to a shift towards external funding (which was offset in noninterest income). 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was 468.6 million, an increase of 54.6 million from 414.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 30.1 million in other operating expense driven by higher funding costs from Cash Connect due to a shift towards external funding and 25.5 million in salaries and benefits, partially offset by a 2.5 million decrease in net corporate development and restructuring costs. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 We and our subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and separate state income tax returns. Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes , which requires the recording of deferred income taxes for tax consequences of temporary differences. We recorded income tax expense of 21.1 million and 63.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to income tax expense of 22.9 million and 66.9 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. 
 Our effective tax rate was 24.7 and 24.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 23.6 and 24.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to an increase in state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to projected tax benefits from our low-income housing tax credit investments, solar tax credit investments and research and development tax credits. 
 The effective tax rate reflects the recognition of certain tax benefits in the financial statements including those benefits from tax-exempt interest income, federal low-income housing tax credits, solar tax credits, research and development tax credits, and excess tax benefits from recognized stock compensation. These tax benefits are offset by the tax effect of stock-based compensation expense related to incentive stock options, tax deficiencies from recognized stock compensation, and a provision for state income tax expense. We frequently analyze our projections of taxable income and make adjustments to our provision for income taxes accordingly.

 RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURE TO GAAP MEASURE 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of tangible book value per share of common stock to book value per share of common stock, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We believe this measure helps management and investors better understand and assess changes from period to period in stockholders equity exclusive of changes in intangible assets. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions including those related to the allowance for credit losses, business combinations, deferred taxes, fair value measurements and goodwill and other intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Although our current estimates contemplate current economic conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, for the remainder of 2024, it is possible that actual conditions may be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Critical accounting estimates at September 30, 2024 did not significantly change from our critical accounting estimates at December 31, 2023, which are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS 
 Recent regulatory developments at September 30, 2024 did not significantly change from our recent regulatory developments at December 31, 2023, which are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as noted below. 
 Bank Merger Review Standards 
 In September 2024, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC finalized a new Policy Statement Regarding Statutory Factors Under the Bank Merger Act (the Policy Statement ), which outlines factors that the OCC will considering when evaluating a proposed bank merger transaction, including factors related to financial stability, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions, and the convenience and needs of the community. The Policy Statement also lists thirteen indicators that will be present in merger applications that are more likely to be approved expeditiously, including that the resulting institution will have total assets less than 50 billion and that the target s total assets are less than 50 percent of the acquirer s total assets. It remains uncertain how the OCC will apply the Policy Statement to particular transactions, and the Policy Statement may make it more difficult and/or costly for us to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or otherwise result in more onerous conditions in approval orders than the OCC has previously imposed. 
 Also in September 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ withdrew from its 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines and announced that it will instead evaluate the competitive impact of bank mergers using its 2023 Merger Guidelines that apply across all industries. Compared to the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, the 2023 Merger Guidelines set forth more stringent concentration limits and add several largely qualitative bases on which the DOJ may challenge a merger. This change in the DOJ s bank merger antitrust policy creates uncertainty regarding the types of transactions that the DOJ may challenge as anticompetitive.
