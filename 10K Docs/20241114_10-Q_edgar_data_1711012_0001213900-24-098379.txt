CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Report ), including, without limitation, statements under the heading Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking
terminology, including the words believes, estimates, anticipates, expects, intends, 
 plans, may, will, potential, projects, predicts, 
 continues, or should, or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. There
can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from expectations. Such statements include, but are not limited to,
any statements relating to our ability to consummate any acquisition or other business combination and any other statements that are
not statements of current or historical facts. These statements are based on management s current expectations, but actual results
may differ materially due to various factors, including, but not limited to: 

our
 goals and strategies, including our ability to maintain our automobile transaction and related services business in China; 

our
 management s ability to properly develop and achieve any future business growth and any improvements in our financial condition
 and results of operations; 

the
 regulations and the impact by public health epidemics in China on the industries we operate in and our business, results of operations
 and financial condition; 

the
 growth or lack of growth in China of disposable household income and the availability and cost of credit available to finance car
 purchases; 

the
 growth or lack of growth of China s online ride-hailing, automobile financing and leasing industries; 

changes
 in online ride-hailing, transportation networks, and other fundamental changes in transportation pattern in China; 

our
 expectations regarding demand for and market acceptance of our products and services; 

our
 expectations regarding our customer base; 

our
 ability to maintain positive relationships with our business partners; 

competition
 in the online ride-hailing, automobile financing and leasing industries in China; 

macro-economic
 and political conditions affecting the global economy generally and the market in China specifically; and 

relevant
 Chinese government policies and regulations relating to the industries in which we operate. 

You
should read this Report and the documents that we refer to in this Report with the understanding that our actual future results may be
materially different from and worse than what we expect. Other sections of this Report and our other reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the SEC include additional factors which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.
Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for
our management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent
to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 

You
should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

This
Report also contains statistical data and estimates that we obtained from industry publications and reports generated by third-parties.
Although we have not independently verified the data, we believe that the publications and reports are reliable. The market data contained
in this Report involves a number of assumptions, estimates and limitations. The ride-hailing and automobile financing markets in China
may not grow at the rates projected by market data, or at all. The failure of these markets to grow at the projected rates may have a
material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common stock. If any one or more of the assumptions underlying the
market data turns out to be incorrect, actual results may differ from the projections based on these assumptions. In addition, projections,
assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industries in which we operate are necessarily
subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described herein or our other reports filed
with the SEC. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

The State of Nevada does not impose any state corporate income tax. 

On
December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax
Act ). The Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and
future foreign earnings are subject to U.S. taxation. The Tax Act also established the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI), a
new inclusion rule affecting non-routine income earned by foreign subsidiaries. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
the Company s foreign subsidiaries in China were operating at loss and as such, did not record a liability for GILTI tax. 

The Company s net operating loss for U.S. income
taxes from U.S amounted to approximately million for both three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and amounted to approximately
 million for both six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company s
net operating loss carryforward for U.S. income taxes was approximately million and million, respectively. The net
operating loss carryforward will not expire and is available to reduce future years taxable income but limited to of income
until utilized. Management believes that the utilization of the benefit from this loss appears uncertain due to the Company s operating
history. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset to reduce the deferred tax assets
to zero on the consolidated balance sheets. Management reviews the valuation allowance periodically and makes changes accordingly.

Our
Discontinued Online Ride-Hailing Platform Services 

From
October 2020 to August 2024, we operated our own online ride-hailing platform in China. The platform (called Xixingtianxia) was owned
and operated by XXTX, of which Senmiao Consulting acquired the 100 equity interest pursuant to a series of investment and supplementary
agreements. XXTX operated Xixingtianxia and held a national online reservation taxi operating license, which served online ride-hailing
drivers in 22 cities in China, providing them with a platform to view and take customer orders for rides. XXTX generated revenue from
providing services to online ride-hailing drivers to assist them in providing transportation services to the riders looking for taxi/ride-hailing
services. XXTX earned commissions for each completed order as the difference between an upfront quoted fare and the amount earned by
a driver based on actual time and distance for the ride charged to the rider. 

Due
the fierce competition of the online ride-hailing industry, XXTX had been suffered loss. Since December 2023, XXTX had engaged Anhui
Lianma Technology Co., Ltd. Anhui Lianma ), a third-party to co-operate the online ride-hailing platform by outsourcing
certain daily operation work to Anhui Lianma in most of cities it operates platform in XXTX and Anhui Lianma will jointly share the operational
profits, with the specific calculation method being defined in the cooperation agreement. However, considering the changes in online
ride-hailing industry and development plan of the Company, on August 8, 2024, we entered into an acquisition agreement with debt assumption
takeover Acquisition Agreement with a third party named Jiangsu Yuelaiyuexing Technology Co., Ltd. Yuelai ),
and certain other parties thereto. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Yuelai acquired all of the equity interests the XXTX at a total
purchase price of zero, while taking over certain liabilities of XXTX as defined in the Acquisition Agreement. On August 20, 2024, the
acquisition was completed and we ceased the online ride-hailing platform services. 

Key
Factors and Risks Affecting Results of Operations 

Ability
to Increase Our Automobile Lessee and Active Driver Base 

Our revenue growth has been
largely driven by the expansion of our automobile lessee base and the corresponding revenue generated from operating and financial leasing.
We acquire customers for our Automobile Transaction and Related Services through the network of third-party sales teams, referral from
online ride-hailing platforms and our own efforts including online advertising and billboard advertising. We also send out fliers and
participate in trade shows to advertise our services. We plan to maintain the number of our customers by marketing our companies to our
existing and prospective automobile lessees in the cities we now operate in. We expect to keep our Active Driver base to promote the growth
of our automobile rental business because we offer automobile rental solutions/incentives specifically targeted at drivers using our Partner
Platforms. An effective cross-selling strategies between our automobile leasing business and our Partner Platforms is important to our
expansion and revenue growth. We also plan to strengthen our marketing efforts through the collaboration with certain automobile dealers
and through our own team by employing more experienced staff, sharing market resources with our equity investee company, and improving
the quality and variety of our services. As of September 30, 2024, we had 4 employees in our own sales department. 

31 

Management
of Automobile Rentals 

Due
to the fierce competition of online ride-hailing industry in those cities we operated in, we have witnessed a high turn-over rate on
the short-term car rentals during the six months ended September 30, 2024. To meet the demand in Chengdu and Changsha, we have purchased
and leased automobiles from third parties for our operating lease. The daily management and timely maintenance of leased automobiles
will have a significant effect on the stability and potential growth of our income from leasing automobiles in the next twelve months.
The effective management, including maintaining the high turn-over rate of our automobiles through our proprietary system and experienced
auto-management team could provide in-time delivery and qualified automobiles to potential lessees, either for personal use or providing
online ride-hailing services. As of September 30, 2024, for parking and management of automobiles for operating lease, we had one parking
lot, an exhibition hall and 3 employees in Changsha, and we also share the parking lot with our equity investee company, Jinkailong in
Chengdu. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average utilization of the automobiles for operating lease was
approximately 80.4 and 72.6 , respectively. During the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average utilization of the
automobiles for operating lease was approximately 85.2 and 76.1 , respectively. 

Our
Service Offerings and Pricing 

The
growth of our revenue depends on our ability to improve existing solutions and services provided, continue identifying evolving business
needs, refine our collaborations with business partners and provide value-added services to our customers. The attraction of new automobile
leases depends on our leasing solutions with attractive rental price and flexible leasing terms. We have also adopted a series of pricing
formulas to adopt the market changes, considering the historical and future expenditure, remaining available leasing months and market
price to determine our rental price for varied rental solutions. Furthermore, our product designs affect the type of automobile leases
we attract, which in turn affect our financial performance. The attraction of new customers depends on the comprehensive income they
could earn from our own or Partner Platforms, which is mainly affected by the number of orders distributed to them through our platform
and the amount of the incentives paid to them from platforms. Our revenue growth also depends on our abilities to effectively price our
services, which enables us to attract more customers and improve our profit margin. 

Ability
to Retain Key Business Cooperators 

Historically,
we have set up a series of strategy and business relationships with certain affiliates of some famous and leading companies of NEVs manufacturers,
online ride-hailing platforms, local NEVs leasing companies, and travel service providers to develop our Automobile Transaction and Related
Services. We earned commission or services fee from them, purchased and leased automobiles for our business at a favorable price. The
close relationships have provided us with the necessary capacity to support the development of our online ride-hailing platform and leasing
business. To retain these valuable cooperators and continuously explore opportunities to collaborate with them in more areas is important
to us to have considerable resources to support the exploration and expansion of our business into new cities. 

Meanwhile,
in order to strengthen our market position in certain cities, during the six months ended September 30, 2024, our subsidiaries, Hunan
Ruixi and Jiekai, cooperated with Partner Platforms, such as Hunan DiDi Technology Co., Ltd., Chengdu Anma Zhixing Technology Co., Ltd.,
Sichuan Peitu Kuaixing Technology Co., Ltd. and Chongqing Yiqizhao Technology Co., Ltd. Chengdu Branch, whereby the online ride-hailing
requests and orders shall be completed on Partner Platforms utilizing the network of cars and drivers of us while Hunan Ruixi and Jiekai
earned rental income from drivers and earned commissions from Partner Platforms. 

Ability
to Collect Receivables on a Timely Basis 

For
receivables from Auto Operating Leasing, we usually settle the rental income with each online ride-hailing driver monthly based on the
product solutions they chose. In accordance with the development of the operating lease business, our Partner Platforms, such as Gaode,
agree to temporarily lock-up the fares of the rides which the driver earned from the platform to ensure the timely collection
of our rental receivables from them. As of September 30, 2024, we had accounts receivable of operating lease of approximately 22,000
in total. Besides, during the six months ended September 30, 2024, we settled our commissions with the Partner Platforms for our online
ride-hailing platform services and automobile rental income on a monthly basis. 

32 

The
efficiency of collection of the monthly and weekly payments has a material impact on our daily operation. Our risk and asset management
department has set up a series of procedures to monitor the collection from drivers. Our business department has also set up a stable
and close relationship with Partner Platforms to ensure the timely collection of commissions. The accounts receivable and advance payments
may increase our liquidity risk. We have used the majority of the proceeds from our equity offerings and plan to seek equity and/or debt
financings to pay for the expenditure related to the automobile purchase. To pay for the expenditure in advance will enhance the stability
of our daily operation and lower the liquidity risk, and attract more customers. 

Ability to Manage Defaults Effectively 

We
manage the credit risk arising from the default of automobile purchasers and lessees by performing credit checks on each automobile purchaser
or lessee based on the credit reports from People s Bank of China and third-party credit rating companies, and personal information
including residence, ethnicity group, driving history and involvement in legal proceeding. Our risk department continuously monitors
the payment by each purchaser and sends them payment reminders. We also keep monitoring the daily gross fare earned by the online ride-hailing
drivers, who are our majority customers and run their business through our online ride-hailing platform during the six months ended September
30, 2024. We do this so that we can evaluate their financial conditions and provide them with assistance including the transfer of automobile
to a new driver if they are no longer interested in providing ride-hailing services or are unable to earn enough income to make monthly
lease/loan payments. 

Further,
the automobiles subject to our financing leases are not collateralized by us. As of September 30, 2024, the total value of non-collateralized
automobiles was approximately 260,000. We believe our risk exposure of financing leasing is immaterial as we have experienced limited
default cases and we are able to re-lease those automobiles to drivers under financing leases. 

Ability
to Compete Effectively 

Our
business and results of operations depend on our ability to compete effectively. Overall, our competitive position may be affected by,
among other things, our service quality and our ability to price our solutions and services competitively. We will set up and continuously
optimize our own business system to improve our service quality and user experience. Our competitors may have more resources than we
do, including financial, technological, marketing and others and may be able to devote greater resources to the development and promotion
of their services. We will need to continue to introduce new or enhance existing solutions and services to continue to attract automobile
dealers, financial institutions, car buyers, lessees, ride-hailing drivers and other industry participants. Whether and how quickly we
can do so will have a significant impact on the growth of our business. 

Market
Opportunity and Government Regulations in China 

The
demand for our services depends on overall market conditions of the online ride-hailing industry in China. The continuous growth of the
urban population places increasing pressure on the urban transportation and the improvement of living standards has increased the market
demand for quality travel in China. Traditional taxi service is limited, and the emerging online platforms have created good opportunities
for the development of the online ride-hailing service market. The market value is expected to increase from RMB354.7 billion in 2024
to RMB751.3 billion in 2028, owing to rising consumer demand for economical mobility options and an amplified penetration of shared mobility
services, especially in lower-tier cities. According to the 54th Statistical report on Internet Development in China published in August
2024 by the China Internet Network Information Center (the CNNIC ), the number of online ride-hailing service users had
reached 503 million by the end of December 2023, and took approximately 45.7 of the total number of Chinese internet users. In addition,
in recent years, aggregation platforms have gained rising significance in the shared mobility industry. According to Frost Sullivan,
the portion of ride hailing orders fulfilled through aggregation platforms increased from 3.5 in 2018 to 30.0 in 2023, and is expected
to further increase to 49.0 by 2028. The online ride-hailing industry is also facing increasing competition in China and is attracting
more capital investment. For example, Dida Inc., Chenqi Technology Limited and CaoCao Inc. have filed their prospectuses to the Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited in March 2024 and April 2024, respectively. 

33 

However,
the participants in the online ride-hailing industry are facing increasingly fierce competitions. According to the Ministry of Transportation
(the MOT of the People s Republic of China, as of August 31, 2024, approximately 359 online ride-hailing platforms
have obtained booking taxi operating licenses and the total volume of online ride-hailing orders was approximately 1,029 million in August
2024 in China, representing an increase of approximately 10 and 25 as compared with the ones as of August 31, 2023, respectively. Meanwhile,
approximately 3.10 million online booking taxi transportation certificates and approximately 7.30 million online booking taxi driver s
licenses were issued nationwide in China, representing an increase of approximately 21 and 20 as compared with the ones as of September
30, 2023, respectively. Since 2023, the municipal transportation bureaus in a series of cities in China have released operational dynamics
and risk warnings for the online ride-hailing industry, stating that the online ride-hailing market has become saturated. They remind
enterprises and practitioners who intend to engage in online ride-hailing services should have a detailed understanding of relevant regulations,
conduct market research, fully consider changes in operating income due to factors such as supply and demand, market conditions, fluctuations
or continuous declines, objectively evaluate the actual income level of industry practitioners, and make rational and prudent career
choices. 

The
online ride-hailing industry may also be affected by, among other factors, the general economic conditions in China. The interest rates
and unemployment rates may affect the demand of ride-hailing services and automobile purchasers willingness to seek credit from
financial institutions. Adverse economic conditions could also reduce the average income of individual and intensify the competition
between platforms. Should any of those negative situations occur, the volume and value of the automobile transactions we service will
decline, and our revenue and financial condition will be negatively impacted. 

On
November 5, 2016, the Municipal Communications Commission of Chengdu City and a number of municipal departments jointly issued the Implementation
Rules for the Administration of Online Booking Taxi Management Services for Chengdu , which was abolished and replaced by the updated
version issued on July 26, 2021. On August 10, 2017, the Transportation Commission of Chengdu further issued the guidelines on compliance
requirements for online ride-hailing businesses, including Working Process for the Online Appointment of Taxi Drivers Qualification Examination
and Issuance and Online Appointment Taxi Transportation Certificate Issuance Process. On November 28, 2016, Guangzhou Municipal People s
Government promulgated Interim Measures for the Management of Online Ride Hailing Operation and Service in Guangzhou, as amended on November
14, 2019. According to these regulations and guidelines, three licenses /certificates are required for operating the online ride-hailing
business in Chengdu and Guangzhou: (1) the ride-hailing service platform should obtain the online booking taxi operating license; (2)
the automobiles used for online ride-hailing should obtain the online booking taxi transportation certificate automobile certificate 
(3) the drivers should obtain the online booking taxi driver s license driver s license ). Besides, all the
new cars used for online ride-hailing in Chengdu should be NEVs since July 2021. 

However, approximately 36 of
our ride-hailing drivers have not obtained the driver s license for online ride-hailing services as of September 30, 2024 while
all of the cars used for online ride-hailing services which we provided management services have the automobile certificate. Without requisite
automobile certificate or driver s license, these drivers may be suspended from providing ride-hailing services, confiscated their
illegal income and subject to fines of up to 10 times of their illegal income. Starting in December 2019, Didi began to enforce such limitation
on drivers in Chengdu who have a driver s license but operate automobiles without the automobile certificate. Meanwhile, during
the six months ended September 30, 2024, Gaode conducted several rounds of compliance checks in Chengdu and other cities. Gaode reduced
the number of orders dispatched to XXTX platform as it found certain drivers who provide their online ride-hailing services through our
platform without obtaining the driver s licenses during the check. We had assisted the drivers to obtain the required certificate
and license for our Automobile Transaction and Related Services. However, there was no guarantee that all of the drivers who run their
online ride-hailing business would be able to obtain all the certificates and licenses. These Partner Platforms may not allow unqualified
drivers who lease our automobiles to drive through these platforms, or reduce their commission income, so that they may not be able to
earn enough income from those Partner Platforms to pay our rental fees. Our business and results of operations shall be materially and
adversely affected if we could not serve qualified drivers or our served drivers are suspended from providing ride-hailing services. 

Furthermore,
according to the Interim Measures, no enterprise or individual is allowed to provide information for conducting online ride-hailing services
to unqualified vehicles and drivers. Pursuant to the Interim Measures, during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, XXTX
had been fined by approximately 3,000 by Traffic Management Bureaus in Changsha for providing online ride-hailing platform services
to unqualified drivers. Since October 2020, XXTX had been fined by approximately 323,000 by Traffic Management Bureaus in Changsha,
Chengdu, Guangzhou and other cities, of which, approximately 65,000 was further compensated by drivers or cooperated third parties. 

34 

The
Chinese government has exercised and continued to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through
regulation and state ownership. For example, the Chinese cybersecurity regulator announced on July 2, 2021 that it had begun an investigation
of Didi and two days later ordered that the company s app be removed from smartphone app stores. We believe that our current operations
are in compliance with the laws and regulations of the Chinese cybersecurity regulator. However, the Company s operations could
be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry.

Revenues

We
started generating revenue from Automobile Transaction and Related Services from our acquisition of Hunan Ruixi on November 22, 2018.
Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 437,258, or approximately 37.0 , as compared with the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease number of the automobiles for operating lease. 

As
we focus on our automobile rental business currently, we expect revenue from our automobile rental to continuously account for a majority
of our revenues. We plan to provide a series of product solutions to sustain and further increase the number of our automobiles for operating
leases. 

The
following table sets forth the breakdown of revenues by revenue source for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Operating
lease revenues from automobile rentals 

We generate revenues from leasing our own automobiles, sub-leasing
automobiles leased from third-parties or rendered by online ride-hailing drivers with their authorization for a lease term of no more
than twelve months. The decrease of rental income of 436,575 or approximately 42.8 during the three months ended September 30, 2024
was mainly due to the decrease in the number of the automobiles leased for operating lease as well as average monthly rental income per
automobile. We leased approximately 596 automobiles with an average monthly rental income of approximately 405 per automobile, resulting
in a rental income of 584,418, including rental income of 3,622 from Jinkailong, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. While
we leased over 960 automobiles with an average monthly rental income of approximately 491 per automobile, resulting in a rental income
of 1,020,993, including rental income of 8,399 from Jinkailong, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

generated revenues of 30,681 and 66,221 from the monthly management and related services provided to our Partner Platforms and other
companies during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 35,540 or approximately 53.7 was
due to decrease in the number of the automobiles and drivers we served, who ran their business through the Partner Platforms. 

Financing
revenues 

We started our financial
leasing business in March 2019 and began to generate interest income from providing financial leasing services to ride-hailing drivers
in April 2019. We also charge the customers of our automobile financing facilitation services interest on their monthly payments which
cover purchase price of automobile and our services fees and facilitation fees for terms of 36 or 48 months. We recognized a total interest
income of 26,853 from an average monthly number of 48 automobiles and 11,340 from an average monthly number of 33 automobiles during
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was due to the monthly payment we charged to customers
and the average number of automobiles served for financial leasing increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Service
fees from NEVs leasing 

We
generated revenues of 51,694 and 4,626 from leasing NEVs by charging leases service fees during the three months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively. The amount of services fees for NEVs leasing is based on our product solutions in accordance which adjusted
with different market conditions.

and rental cost of automobiles, daily maintenance and insurance expense of automobiles which related to our Auto Operating Leasing. Cost
of revenues decreased by 353,901 or approximately 35 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period
in 2023, mainly due to the decrease of 349,902 in costs of automobiles under operating leases due to the decrease in the number of the
automobiles leased for operating lease in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the decrease of 3,999 in costs of our Auto Sales.
During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the costs of automobiles under operating leases with amount of 17,334 and

automobiles leased for operating lease as well as average monthly rental income per automobile. We leased approximately 627 automobiles with an average monthly rental income of
approximately 413 per automobile, resulting in a rental income of 1,340,733, including rental income of 8,865 from Jinkailong,

fees from NEVs leasing

of completed orders.

Interest
Expense

expense for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 from discontinued operations was 2,512 and 8,372, respectively, which
resulted from the borrowings of XXTX from a financial institution for its working capital turnover.

a result of the foregoing, the net loss from discontinued operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was 186,714
and 213,647, respectively. While the net loss from discontinued operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 was
 125,051 and 176,885, respectively. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

We
have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from our equity offerings, stockholder loans, commercial debt and cash flow from
operations. 

We
had cash and cash equivalents of 792,025 as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 737,719 as of March 31, 2024. We primarily hold our
excess unrestricted cash in short-term interest-bearing bank accounts at financial institutions. 

Our
business is capital intensive. We have considered whether there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
due to (1) the net loss of approximately 1.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024; (2) accumulated deficit of approximately
 42.8 million as of September 30, 2024; (3) the working capital deficit of approximately 3.4 million as of September 30, 2024; and (4)
a purchase commitment of approximately 0.9 million for 100 automobiles. As of the filing date of this Report, we have entered into a
purchase contract with an automobile dealer to purchase a total of 100 automobiles in the amount of approximately 1.6 million, of which,
approximately 0.7 million has been remitted as purchase prepayments. The remaining purchase commitment of approximately 0.9 million
shall be remitted in installment to be completed before March 31, 2025. 

We
do not believe that the proceeds from our public offerings and our anticipated cash flows would be sufficient to meet our anticipated
working capital requirements and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business for the next 12 months from the date of this
Report. We have determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to generate
significant revenue, we may be required to cease or curtail our operations. We are trying to alleviate the going concern risk through
the following sources: 

equity
 financing to support our working capital; 

other
 available sources of financing (including debt) from PRC banks and other financial institutions; and 

financial
 support and credit guarantee commitments from our related parties. 

44 

Based on the above considerations,
we are of the opinion that we will probably not have sufficient funds to meet our working capital requirements and debt obligations as
they become due one year from the filing date of this Report, if we are unable to obtain additional financing. In addition, there is no
assurance that we will be successful in implementing the foregoing plans or that additional capitals will be available to us on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all. There are a number of factors that could potentially arise that could undermine our plans, such as (i) changes
in the demand for our services, (ii) PRC government policies, (iii) economic conditions in China and worldwide, (iv) competitive pricing
in the automobile transaction and related service and ride-hailing industries, (v) changes in our relationships with key business partners,
(vi) that financial institutions in China may not able to provide continued financial support to our customers, and (vii) the perception
of PRC-based companies in the U.S. capital markets. Our inability to secure needed financing when required could require material changes
to our business plans and could have a material adverse effect on our viability and results of operations.

operations. While for the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 88,129, which consisted
of net inflows of 340,826 from continuing operations and net outflows of 252,697 from discontinued operations. 

The
decrease of 74,999 in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the six months ended September 30, 2024
as compared with the six months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to (1) decrease of 477,290 in net loss; (2) the
gain of 397,775 from deconsolidation of XXTX; (3) decrease of 324,960 in the provision for credit losses; (4) decrease of 252,831
in the change of accrued expenses and other liabilities (both third parties and due to a related party); and (5) decrease of 139,995
in the change of accounts payable; partially offset by (6) increase of 379,253 in change of fair value of derivative liabilities (from
a gain to a loss); and (7) increase of 195,919 in the change of prepayments, other receivables and other assets (both third parties
and related party). 

Cash
Flow in Investing Activities

proceeds from sales of the used-automobiles and rendered automobiles of 81,251. 

Cash
Flow in Financing Activities

was consisted of: (1) borrowings from a related party of 33,582; and (2) repayments from a related party of 13,884; partially offset
by (3) principal payments made for finance lease liabilities of 11,733.

activities from discontinued operations primarily attributable to the borrowings from a financial institution of 244,010. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of the filing date of this Report, we have the following off-balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a future effect on our
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations and liquidity: 

Purchase
 Commitments 

On
September 23, 2022, we entered into a purchase contract with an automobile dealer to purchase a total of 100 automobiles for the amount
of approximately 1.6 million, of which approximately 0.7 million has been remitted as purchase prepayments, and we expect to fulfill
the purchase commitment before March 31, 2025. 

Contingent
 Liabilities 

As Hunan Ruixi holds 35 
of equity interest of Jinkailong and has not made any payments towards to the investment, Hunan Ruixi will subject to the maximum amount
of RMB3.5 million (approximately 499,000) of which is equivalent to 35 of liabilities in case Jinkailong is liquidated in accordance
with PRC s company registry compliance. 

Inflation 

We
do not believe our business and operations have been materially affected by inflation. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation
of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. We have identified certain accounting estimates that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These estimates
are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Certain accounting estimates are particularly
sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate
may differ significantly from management s current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting estimates involve the
most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. 

In
presenting the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgement and available information.
Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews these estimates and assumptions
using the currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may cause us to revise our estimates. we base our estimates
on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Estimates are used when accounting for items and matters including, but
not limited to the critical accounting estimates as follows. 

When
reading our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, you should consider our selection of critical accounting policies,
the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in
conditions and assumptions. Our critical accounting policies and practices include the following: (i) fair values of financial instruments,
including derivative liabilities; (ii) accounts receivable, net; (iii) property and equipment, net; (iv) intangible assets, net; (v)
revenue recognition; and (vi) leases - lessee. See Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial
statements in our 2024 Form 10-K for the disclosure of these accounting policies. We believe the following accounting estimates involve
the most significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. 

46 

(a)
Derivative liabilities 

A
contract is designated as an asset or a liability and is carried at fair value on a company s balance sheet, with any changes in
fair value recorded in a company s results of operations. We then determine which options, warrants and embedded features require
liability accounting and records the fair value as a derivative liability by using Black-Scholes model. The changes in the values of
these instruments are shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as change in fair
value of derivative liabilities . 

(b)
Allowance for credit losses 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments, which requires us to measure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held and not
accounted for at fair value through net income. We adopted this guidance effective April 1, 2023. ASC 326 introduces an approach based
on expected losses to estimate the allowance for credit losses, which replaces the previous incurred loss impairment model. The adoption
of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounts receivable are recognized and carried
at original invoiced amount less an estimated allowance for credit losses. We estimate the allowance for credit losses based on an analysis
of the aging of accounts receivable, assessment of collectability, including any known or anticipated economic conditions, customer-specific
circumstances, recent payment history and other relevant factors. 

The
balance of other receivables is unsecured and is reviewed periodically to determine whether their carrying value has become impaired.
We consider the balances to be impaired if the collectability of the balances becomes doubtful. We use the individual
specific valuation method to estimate the allowance for uncollectible balances. The allowance is also based on management s
best estimate of specific losses on individual exposures, as well as a provision on historical trends of collections and utilizations.
Actual amounts received or utilized may differ from management s estimate of credit worthiness and the economic environment. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses represented approximately 6.7 and 7.2 of gross accounts receivable
balances, respectively. The provision is recorded against accounts receivable balances, with a corresponding charge recorded in the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Delinquent account balances are written-off against the allowance for credit losses
after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable. Allowance for credit losses balances amounted to 1,590
and 1,545 as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively for accounts receivable. Allowance for credit losses balances amounted
to 21,065 and 20,474 as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively for deposits and other receivables. Allowance for credit
losses balances amounted to 3,554,026 and 3,099,701 as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, for amount due from
a related party. 

(c)
Leases - Lessee 

Finance
and operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments
over the lease term. Since the implicit rate for our leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based
on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate
is the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments, in a similar
economic environment and over a similar term. 

47 

Lease
terms used to calculate the present value of lease payments generally do not include any options to extend, renew, or terminate the lease,
as we do not have reasonable certainty at lease inception that these options will be exercised. We generally consider the economic life
of its operating lease ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. We have elected the short-term lease exception;
therefore, operating lease ROU assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. The leases generally
do not provide a residual guarantee. The finance or operating lease ROU asset also excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the lease term for operating lease. Meanwhile, we recognize the finance leases ROU assets and interest
on an amortized cost basis. The amortization of finance ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis as amortization expense, while
the lease liability is increased to reflect interest on the liability and decreased to reflect the lease payments made during the period.
Interest expense on the lease liability is determined each period during the lease term as the amount that results in a constant periodic
interest rate of the automobile loans on the remaining balance of the liability. 

We
review the impairment of our ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for our other long-lived assets. We review the recoverability
of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur, indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.
The assessment of possible impairment is based on its ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted
future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations. We have elected to include the carrying amount of operating lease liabilities in
any tested asset group and include the associated operating lease payments in the undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows. 

(d)
Impairment of long-lived assets 

Long-lived
assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that
the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash
flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of
the asset. If an impairment is identified, we would reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted
cash flows approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. For the three
and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not recognize impairment for property and equipment and intangible assets. 

(e)
Valuation of deferred tax assets 

Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing
authorities.

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based
on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended), as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due to the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: 

We
 did not have sufficient personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience
 to address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review financial statements
 and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP. Specifically, our control did not operate effectively
 to ensure the appropriate and timely analysis of and accounting for unusual and non-routine
 transactions and certain financial statement accounts; 

We
 are lacking adequate policies and procedures in internal audit function to ensure that our
 policies and procedures have been carried out as planned; and 

We
 had deficiencies in our IT general controls, regarding to the Logical Access Security, Change
 Management, IT Operations and Cybersecurity of our financial system and key application system,
 etc. 

We
are improving our IT environment and daily management to ensure network and information security. In addition, we plan to address the
weaknesses identified above by implementing the following measures: 

(i) Continuously
 seeking and hiring additional accounting staff with comprehensive knowledge of U.S. GAAP
 and SEC reporting requirements; 

(ii) Ameliorating
 our internal audit to assist with assessment of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance requirements and
 improvement of internal controls related to financial reporting; and 

(iii) improving
 our IT environment and daily management. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
