and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, the Company had negative cash flows from operations of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s accumulated deficit was . The Company has funded its operations to date through equity and debt financing and has cash on hand (including restricted cash equivalents) of restricted bank deposits of as of September 30, 2024. The Company monitors its cash flow projections on a current basis and takes active measures to obtain the funding it requires to continue its operations. However, these cash flow projections are subject to various uncertainties concerning their fulfilment such as the ability to increase revenues by attracting and expanding its customer base or reducing cost structure. If the Company is not successful in generating sufficient cash flow or completing additional financing, including debt refinancing which shall release restricted cash, then it will need to execute a new cost reduction plan in addition to previous cost reduction plans that were executed so far. The Company s transition to profitable operations is dependent on generating a level of revenue adequate to support its cost structure. The Company expects to fund operations using cash on hand, through operational cash flows and raising additional proceeds. There are no assurances, however, that the Company will be able to generate the revenue necessary to support its cost structure or that it will be successful in obtaining the level of financing necessary for its operations. Management has evaluated the significance of these conditions and has determined that the Company does not have sufficient resources to meet its operating obligations for at least one year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

c. On
 October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a series of attacks on civilian and military targets in Southern
 and Central Israel, to which the Israel Defense Forces have responded. In addition, both
 Hezbollah and the Houthi movement have attacked military and civilian targets in Northern
 Israel, to which Israel has responded, including through increased air and ground operations
 in Lebanon. In addition, the Houthi movement has attacked international shipping lanes in
 the red sea. Further, on April 2024, and on October 2024, Iran launched a series of drone
 and missile strikes against Israel, to which Israel has responded. To date our operations
 and financial results have not been materially affected. The Company continues to monitor
 its ongoing activities and will make adjustments in its business if needed, including updating
 any estimates or judgments impacting its financial statements as appropriate, while supporting
 the safety and well-being of its employees. It is currently not possible to predict the effects
 of such conflicts and its impact on the Company s business, operations or financial
 conditions. We continue to monitor political and military developments closely and examine
 the consequences for our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Comerica Warrants are exercisable at any time during the contract period which ends on August 24, 2026. 

Additionally,
in connection with the consummation of the IPO which occurred in May 2022, and the change of the type of the stock from redeemable preferred
stock to common stock at conversion, the Company reassessed the Comerica Warrants. As part of the contractual terms and conditions of
Comerica s Warrants, a portion of the warrants are exercisable, as of the IPO date, into the Company s common stock. 

The
Company has evaluated whether the Comerica Warrants are still classified as liabilities and concluded that due to a change-of-control
provision which may affect the exercise price or entitle Comerica to demand cash, instead of shares, to settle the warrants, Comerica s
Warrants will continue to be classified as liabilities and will be exercisable into the Company s common shares. The Comerica Warrants

Overview 

We are a market leader in
cyber-hardened, rapid-deployment networking solutions for wide-area IoT applications including federal, state and local government, intelligent
traffic systems, military, utility, rail, telecom and campus applications. Our unique portfolio of hybrid fiber, environmentally hardened
aggregation switches, high density Ethernet devices, advanced management software and cyber-protection capabilities, unlocks the hidden
value of essential networks, delivering safer connectivity for rapid, cost-effective deployment. 

Our networking solutions
use a combination of newly deployed fiber infrastructure and existing copper and coaxial lines which our patented technology can upgrade
to Fiber-grade to jointly create what we believe to be a highly cost-effective, secure and quick-to-deploy network. Our patent protected
hybrid fiber networking solutions deliver excellent communication over fiber to locations that may be easy to reach with new fiber. However,
for locations that are difficult, or too costly to reach with fiber, we can upgrade existing copper lines to deliver cyber-hardened,
high-speed connectivity without needing to replace the existing copper infrastructure with new fiber. We believe that such hybrid fiber-copper
networking solution has distinct advantages in most real-life installations, while providing significant budget savings and accelerating
deployment of modern IoT networks, as based on our experience, most IoT projects have challenging, hard to reach with fiber locations
which may explode such projects timeline and budgets. We believe that our solutions can provide connectivity over either fiber
or copper with speeds of up to multi-Gigabit communication, while supporting Fiber-grade reliability and quality. 

A primary focus of ours is
to provide our customers with a cyber-secure network solution. We currently offer Triple-Shield protection of data delivered with coding,
scrambling and encryption of the network traffic. We also provide secure, encrypted access to our network management software, and are
working to further enhance system-level and device-level software protection. We are also working to introduce additional capabilities
for network-wide cyber protection software as an additional SW and license-based service. 

When high speed, long reach,
reliable and secure connectivity is required, network operators usually resort to using wireline communication over physical communication
lines such as fiber, coax and copper, rather than wireless communication that is more limited in performance, reliability, reach and
security. However, new fiber wireline infrastructure is costly to deploy, involves lengthy civil works to install, and, based on our
internal calculations, often accounts for more than 50 of total cost of ownership (ToC) and time to deploy wide-area IoT projects. 

2 

Providing new fiber connectivity
to hard-to-reach locations is especially costly and time-consuming, often requiring permits for boring, trenching, and right-of-way,
sometimes done over many miles. Connecting such hard-to-reach locations may cause significant delays and budget overruns in IoT projects.
Our solutions aim to solve these challenges by instantly enhancing performance of such existing copper and coax infrastructure to fiber-grade
performance, through the use of advanced signal processing an unique, patented network architecture, without the need to run new fiber
to hard-to-reach locations; thus, effectively accelerating deployment of many IoT projects, as we estimate, sometimes from many months
to only days. The result for the network owner isa hybrid network that optimizes the use of both new Fiber (where available) as
well as upgraded, fiber-grade copper and coax that is now modernized, digitized and cyber-hardened. This unique hybrid network approach
is making IoT projects often significantly more affordable, fast to deploy and predictable to plan and budget. 

In addition, our solutions
can also provide power over existing copper and coax lines to remotely power up network elements and IoT components connected to them
(like cameras, small cell and Wi-Fi base stations sensors etc.). Connecting power lines to millions of IoT locations can be costly and
very time consuming as well (similar to data connectivity, for the same reason-need for civil works). By offering the ability to combine
power delivery over the same existing copper and coax lines that we use for high-speed data, we believe our solutions are solving yet
another important challenge in connecting hard-to-reach locations. We believe that combining communication and power over the same existing
lines is particularly important to help connect many fifth generation, or 5G, small cells and Wi-Fi base stations, as high cost of connectivity
and power is often slowing their deployment. 

Since our inception, our
business was focused on serving telecommunication service providers, also known as Telcos, to provide connectivity for enterprises and
residential customers. Our products and solutions have been deployed with more than 100 telecommunication service providers worldwide,
in enterprise, residential and mobile base station connectivity applications. In recent years, as we have further developed our
technology and introduced additional products, we turned our focus on serving the wide-area IoT markets. Our operations are focused on
our fast-growing IoT business, while maintaining our commitment to our existing Telco customers. In 2023, we introduced new product offering,
some of which could serve both the IoT markets and our Telco customers. 

Recent Developments 

Nasdaq Listing Compliance 

On August 25, 2023, we received
a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to our failure to maintain a minimum of 2,500,000 in
shareholders equity (the Minimum Shareholders Equity Requirement or any alternatives to such requirement.
In order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we submitted a plan of compliance addressing how we intended to regain
compliance. On March 27, 2024, we received a delist determination letter from Nasdaq advising us that the Staff had determined to delist
our securities from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with the Minimum Shareholders Equity Requirement, unless we timely request a
hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ). We timely requested a hearing before the Panel. 

On August 27, 2024, we received
formal written notice from Nasdaq confirming that we have evidenced compliance with all applicable criteria for continued listing on
Nasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550, including the Minimum Shareholders Equity Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), we will remain subject to a panel monitor for equity compliance through August 27, 2025. 

Hamas-Israel War

In October 2023, Hamas terrorists
infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas
also launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s border with the
Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, and Hamas additionally
kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced
a military campaign against Hamas and these terrorist organizations in parallel continued rocket and terror attacks. Nevertheless, our
clinical and business development activities remain on track. See also Risk Factors We conduct our operations in Israel.
Conditions in Israel, including the recent attack by Hamas and other terrorist organizations and Israel s war against them, may
affect our operations . 

QIND Term Sheet 

On May 23, 2024, we announced
that we have entered into a binding term sheet (as amended, the Term Sheet with Quality Industrial Corp, a Nevada corporation
traded on the OTC under the symbol QIND Target ), and Ilustrato Pictures International Inc., a Nevada corporation, providing
for the potential acquisition of between 61 to 75 of the issued and outstanding shares of the Target s share capital. 

On November 11, 2024, the
Company notified the Target that the Term Sheet is terminated.

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30,
2024, Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

Our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted
to 2.54 million compared to 0.85 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase from the corresponding period was
primarily attributable to an increase of 1.4 million of revenues generated from North America driven by volume increase and a renewal
of a service and software contract and an increase of 0.3 million of revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East
and Africa driven by volume increase. 

Our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted
to 6.7 compared to 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase from the corresponding period was primarily
attributable to an increase of 3.4 million in revenues generated from North America associated with volume increase and a renewal of
a service and software contract offset by decrease of 1.3 million in revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East
and Africa associated with completed projects in the prior year period. 

Cost of Revenues 

Our cost of revenues for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 0.8 million compared to 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
The increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues as well as change in the product mix
as well as indirect costs not increasing significantly with revenues growing. 

Our cost of revenues for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 2.8 million compared to 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The decrease from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to the change in regional mix of revenue of an increase in North
America revenues, which are more profitable, and a decrease in Europe, Middle East and Africa revenues which are less profitable as well
as indirect costs not increasing significantly with revenues growing. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Our research and development
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 0.5 million compared to 0.7 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to cost reduction measures taken. 

Our research and development
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 1.7 million compared to 2.1 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to cost reduction measures taken. 

4 

Sales and Marketing Expenses 

Our sales and marketing expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 0.7 million compared to 0.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Our sales and marketing expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 2.0 million compared to 2.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Our general and administrative
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 0.8 million compared to 1.0 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease is driven by cost reduction measures taken. 

Our general and administrative
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 2.4 million compared to 2.8 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease is driven by cost reduction measures taken. 

Other Income 

Our Other Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted
to 163,000 compared to none for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is driven by a government grant from the State
of Israel associated with the Iron Swords war received during the second quarter of 2024. 

Operating Loss 

Our operating loss for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.3 million, compared to an operating loss of 2.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction
measures taken, reducing operating expenses. 

Our operating loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2.1 million, compared to an operating loss of 5.7 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction
measures taken, reducing operating expenses. 

Financial Expenses, Net and Interest Expenses 

Our financial income, net
was 52,000 million and our interest expense was 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial income,
net of 1.4 million and including 0.2 million interest expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly
due to financial income in the prior year from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period. 

Our financial income, net
was 138,000 and our interest expense was 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial income, net
of 1.9 million and interest expense of 0.5 million interest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly
due to financial income in the prior year from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period. 

Net Loss 

Our net loss for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.5 million, compared to net loss of 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
This decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures
taken, reducing operating expenses, partially offset by financial income in the prior year not repeating itself. 

Our net loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, was 2.6 million, compared to net loss of 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily
due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating
expenses, partially offset by financial income in the prior year not repeating itself.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information 

Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA margin are Non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we provide
Non-GAAP supplemental operating results adjusted for certain items, including: financial expenses, which are interest, financial instrument
fair value adjustments, exchange rate differences of assets and liabilities, stock based compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization
expense, tax expense, and impact of development expenses ahead of product launch. We adjust for the items listed above and show non-GAAP
financial measures in all periods presented, unless the impact is clearly immaterial to our financial statements. When we calculate the
tax effect of the adjustments, we include all current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with the adjusted measure of pre-tax
profitability. 

We utilize the adjusted results
to review our ongoing operations without the effect of these adjustments but not for comparison to budgeted operating results.. We believe
the supplemental adjusted results are useful to investors because they help them compare our results to previous periods and provide
important insights into underlying trends in the business and how management oversees and optimizes our business operations on a day-to-day
basis. We exclude the costs in calculating adjusted results to allow us and investors to evaluate the performance of the business based
upon its expected ongoing operating structure. We believe the adjusted measures, accompanied by the disclosure of the costs of these
programs, provides valuable insight to our financial performance. Adjusted results should be considered only in conjunction with results
reported according to GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since our inception, we have
financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, debt financing, convertible loans and royalty-bearing grants
that we received from the Israel Innovation Authority. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are to finance working capital,
capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. 

Our future capital requirements
will be affected by many factors, including our revenue growth, the timing and extent of investments to support such growth, the expansion
of sales and marketing activities, increases in general and administrative costs, repayment of principal of our existing credit line,
working capital to support securing raw material supply and many other factors as described under Risk Factors. 

6 

To the extent additional
funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will
be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources
of funds; however, such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. In particular, the repercussions from the COVID
19 pandemic, as well as the war in Israel and the war between Russia and the Ukraine, has resulted in, and may continue to result in,
significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital. 

On
June 5, 2024, we entered into an inducement agreement with a certain holder of certain of our existing warrants to purchase up to an
aggregate of 999,670 shares of our common stock originally issued on May 8, 2023, with a five and one-half year term, at an exercise
price of 2.75 per share (the May 2023 Warrants ). Pursuant to the inducement agreement, the holder agreed to exercise for
cash its May 2023 Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 999,670 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 2.75 per share, in
consideration of our agreement to issue new common stock purchase warrants (the June 2024 Warrants ), as described below,
to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,999,340 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of 2.00 per share. The closing of the June
2024 Warrant Inducement occurred on June 6, 2024, and resulted in gross proceeds from the exercise of the existing warrants by the holder
to the Company of 3.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. 

On June 30, 2024, we entered
into an inducement letter with a holder of our June 2024 Warrants, to purchase up to an aggregate of 999,670 shares of the June 2024
Warrants, originally issued on June 6, 2024, with a twenty-four month term, at an exercise price of 2.00 per share. Pursuant to the
inducement letter, the holder agreed to exercise for cash its warrants to purchase an aggregate of 999,670 shares of our common stock
at an exercise price of 2.00 per share, in consideration of our agreement to issue new common stock purchase warrants (the July
2024 Warrants ), as descried below, to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,999,340 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price
of 1.75 per share. The closing of the July 2024 Warrant Inducement occurred on July 2, 2024, and resulted in gross proceeds from the
exercise of the existing warrants by the holder to the Company of 2.25 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering
expenses payable by the Company. 

On September 18, 2024, we
filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the Registration Statement ). Pursuant to the Registration Statement,
we may offer and sell securities having an aggregate public offering price of up to 50.0 million. In connection with the filing of the
Registration Statement, on September 25, 2024, we entered into a sales agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co. (the Sales
Agent ), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock for an aggregate offering price of up to 3.4 million
under an at-the-market offering program (the ATM ), which is included in the 50.0 million of securities that
may be offered pursuant to the Registration Statement. Pursuant to the ATM, we will pay the Sales Agent a commission rate of up to 3.0 
of the gross proceeds from the sale of any shares of our common stock. We are not obligated to make any sales of shares under the ATM.
As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 227,939 shares of our common stock and received approximately 317,000 in net proceeds under the
ATM. 

As discussed in Note 1(c)
to the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have incurred significant
losses and negative cash flows from operations and incurred losses of 2.5 million and 6.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December
31, 2023, we had negative cash flows from operations of 4.7 million and 6.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had
negative working capital and an accumulated deficit of 42.2 million. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had cash on hand (including short term deposits and restricted bank deposits) of approximately 2.3 million and long-term deposits,
restricted bank deposits and restricted cash of 300,000. We monitor our cash flow projections on a current basis and take active measures
to obtain the funding we require to continue our operations, as well as make adjustments to our cost structure that were done year to
date. However, these cash flow projections are subject to various uncertainties concerning their fulfilment, such as the ability to increase
revenues by attracting and expanding our customer base or reducing cost structure. If we are not successful in generating sufficient
cash flow or completing additional financing, then we will need to execute additional cost reduction actions that have been planned.
Our transition to profitable operations is dependent on generating a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. We expect
to fund operations using cash on hand, through operational cash flows and raising additional proceeds. There are no assurances, however,
that we will be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our cost structure or that we will be successful in obtaining the level
of financing necessary for our operations. Management has evaluated the significance of these conditions and has determined that we do
not have sufficient resources to meet our operating obligations for at least one year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated
financial statements. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Cash used in operating activities
amounted to 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The decrease in cash used in operating activities was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken. 

Net cash provided by investing
activities was 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in investing activities of 1.4 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from the corresponding period was mainly due to the reduction in short-term bank deposits. 

Net cash provided by financing
activities was 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.6 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease is related to the repayment of long-term loan, offset by funds raised from an investor warrant exercise. See notes
2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
finance or special purpose entities. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our condensed consolidated
financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements
requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the applicable periods. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments
are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions
and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, which, in turn,
could change the results from those reported. 

Our management s discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Our significant accounting
policies include revenue from contracts with customers which is more fully described in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial
statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our annual financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2023, including the footnotes, for a description of our significant accounting policies. We believe that these accounting policies
discussed are critical to our financial results and to the understanding of our past and future performance, as these policies relate
to the more significant areas involving management s estimates and assumptions. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical
if: (1) it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly
uncertain at the time we were making our estimate; and (2) changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our financial condition
or results of operations.

Item 3. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. 

Not required for a smaller
reporting company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We continued to conduct ongoing
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures , as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of
Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. This evaluation, which was performed under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial
Officer CFO ), is performed to determine whether our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and
are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified by the SEC s rules and forms. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls
and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and effectively operated, can only provide reasonable
assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Based upon that evaluation,
our CEO and CFO concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the period covered by this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q due to the material weakness discussed below. 

Management s
report on internal control over financial reporting 

Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
GAAP. 

Because of its inherent limitations,
our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error,
the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. 

Under the supervision and
with the participation of the CEO and the CFO, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2024. We performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 given the existence of the previously identified material
weakness described below having not been remediated as of the last day of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 

Material Weakness 

We have identified one material
weakness in our design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the preparation of our financial
remediated as of September 30, 2024. 

A material weakness is a
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. The Company s management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of September 30, 2024: 

9 

We lacked a sufficient complement
of professionals with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to maintain appropriate segregation of duties
in our finance and accounting functions. 

Our independent registered
public accounting firm will not be required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. 

Remediation Plan and Status 

We have taken and intend
to continue to take actions to remediate the material weakness described above. To remediate this material weakness, we continue
to map, document and test our internal controls (recently, with the assistance of a third-party accounting firm with specific expertise
in SOX compliance), and accordingly, we continued to make progress in our internal controls plan. Among other procedures, management
has executed the following remedial actions: 

Hired new financial experts and increasing the number of financial
 personnel. 

Continued to map, document and test our internal controls, with the
 assistance of a third-party accounting firm with specific expertise in SOX compliance. 

Implemented new control procedures over certain areas identified as
 requiring enhancement in order to address the lack of a sufficient number of finance personnel to allow for adequate segregation
 of duties. 

In addition to the actions
underway, we continue to add enhancements to our internal controls over financial reporting in 2024. Additional remedial actions include: 

Maintain or increase the level and design of segregation of duties,
 including maintaining or growing the quality and number of finance personnel 

Continue to document and test annually our internal control over financial
 reporting 

Continue engagement with an outside accounting firm with specific SOX
 and Internal Control expertise 

Continued hiring of additional accounting, information technology,
 and internal controls resources who possess public company accounting, auditing and reporting expertise 

The actions we are taking
are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight of the audit committee of our Board. We also may conclude that
additional measures may be required to remediate the material weaknesses or determine to modify the remediation plans described above.
We will not be able to fully remediate this material weakness until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively.
We will continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures, and controls and make any further
changes management deems appropriate. 

In addition to the items
noted above, as we continue to evaluate, remediate and improve our internal control over financial reporting, executive management may
elect to implement additional measures to address control deficiencies or may determine that the remediation efforts described above
require modification. Executive management, in consultation with and at the direction of our Audit Committee and an expert outside consultant,
will continue to assess the control environment and the above-mentioned efforts to remediate the underlying causes of the identified
material weakness. 

Although we plan to complete
this remediation process as quickly as possible, we are unable, at this time to estimate how long it will take; and our efforts may not
be successful in remediating the deficiencies or material weaknesses. 

Notwithstanding the material
weakness set forth above, based on the performance of additional procedures by management designed to ensure reliability of financial
reporting, the Company s management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows
as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with GAAP. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter
ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Part II - Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

From time to time, we are
involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. To the knowledge of our management, there are
no legal proceedings currently pending against us which we believe would have a material effect on our business, financial position or
results of operations and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no such legal proceedings contemplated or threatened. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Except as set forth below
in this Item 1A and the Risk Factors included in our previous filings made with the SEC, there have been no material changes to our risk
factors from those disclosed in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024. 

Conditions in the Middle
East and in Israel, where our research and development facilities are located, may harm our operations. 

Our office where we conduct
our research and development, operations, sales outside the Americas, and administration activities, is located in Israel. Many of our
employees are residents of Israel. Most of our officers and directors are residents of Israel. Since the establishment of the State of
Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries, and between Israel and the
Hamas (an Islamist militia and political group in the Gaza Strip) and Hezbollah (an Islamist militia and political group in Lebanon). 

In particular, in October
2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and
military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s
border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries,
and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared
war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and Hezbollah and these terrorist organizations in parallel continued
rocket and terror attacks. As a result of the events of October 7, 2023 whereby Hamas terrorists invaded southern Israel and launched
thousands of rockets in a widespread terrorist attack on Israel, the Israeli government declared that the country was at war and the
Israeli military began to call-up reservists for active duty. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have not been
impacted by any absences of personnel at our service providers or counterparties located in Israel. Military service call ups that result
in absences of personnel from us for an extended period of time may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial
condition and results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we currently have 42 full-time employees, with 33 employees
located in Israel and 9 employees located outside of Israel. 

Since the war broke out on
October 7, 2023, our operations have not been adversely affected by this situation, and we have not experienced any material disruptions
to our operations. We have the ability, if necessary, to shift our manufacturing from Israel to other countries where we have business
partners, and we have not had customers in Israel in the last year. However, the intensity and duration of the war in the Middle East
is difficult to predict at this stage, as are such war s economic implications on the Company s business and operations and
on Israel s economy in general. if the war in the other fronts, such as Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank expands further, our operations
may be adversely affected. 

In addition, since the commencement
of these events, there have been continued hostilities along Israel s northern border with Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization)
and southern border (with the Houthi movement in Yemen). It is possible that hostilities with Hezbollah in Lebanon will escalate, and
that other terrorist organizations, including Palestinian military organizations in the West Bank as well as other hostile countries
will join the hostilities. Such clashes may escalate in the future into a greater regional conflict. In addition, Iran recently launched
a direct attack on Israel involved hundreds of drones and missiles, and has threatened to continue to attack Israel and is widely believed
to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas
in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria. These situations may potentially
escalate in the future to more violent events which may affect Israel and us. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political
instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions, could harm our results of operations and could make it more difficult
for us to raise capital. Parties with whom we do business may decline to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension,
forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary in order to meet our business partners face to face. In addition, the political
and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they
are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements. Further,
in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to economic boycotts. Several countries still restrict business
with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our operating
results, financial condition or the expansion of our business. 

Any hostilities involving
Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and
results of operations. In recent years, the hostilities involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel,
including areas in which our employees and some of our consultants are located, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. 

Our commercial insurance
does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Although the Israeli
government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot
assure you that this government coverage will be maintained. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect
on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would likely negatively affect business conditions and could
harm our results of operations. To-date, we have received Israeli government war related support funding of approximately 100,000. 

11 

Finally, political conditions
within Israel may affect our operations. Israel has held five general elections between 2019 and 2022, and prior to October 2023, the
Israeli government pursued extensive changes to Israel s judicial system, which sparked extensive political debate and unrest.
To date, these initiatives have been substantially put on hold. Actual or perceived political instability in Israel or any negative changes
in the political environment, may individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Israeli economy and, in turn, our business, financial
condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 

If we fail to comply
with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock
and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. 

Nasdaq has established certain
standards for the continued listing of a security on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The standards for continued listing include, among other
things, that the minimum bid price for the listed securities not fall below 1.00 per share for a period of 30 consecutive trading days
and that we maintain a minimum of 2,500,000 in shareholders equity. 

We have in the past, and
may in the future, be unable to comply with certain of the listing standards that we are required to meet to maintain the listing of
our ordinary shares on Nasdaq. 

For instance, on August 25,
2023, we received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to our failure to maintain a
minimum of 2,500,000 in shareholders equity (the Minimum Shareholders Equity Requirement or any alternatives
to such requirement. In order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we submitted a plan of compliance addressing how
we intended to regain compliance 

On August 27, 2024, we received
formal written notice from Nasdaq confirming that we have evidenced compliance with all applicable criteria for continued listing on
Nasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550, including the Minimum Shareholders Equity Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), we will remain subject to a panel monitor for equity compliance through August 27, 2025. 

In addition, on May 20, 2024,
the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notified the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements
set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires the Company s common stock to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00
per share. On June 20, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq that, for the 10 consecutive business days from June 5, 2024 to
June 28, 2024, the closing bid price of the Company s common stock had been at 1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, the Company
has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and Nasdaq considers the prior bid price deficiency matter now closed. 

If we fail to satisfy the
continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as minimum stockholders equity requirements or minimum bid price requirements,
Nasdaq may take steps to delist our shares of common stock. Such a delisting would have a negative effect on the price of our shares
of common stock, impair the ability to sell or purchase our shares of common stock when persons wish to do so, and any delisting materially
adversely affect our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions on acceptable terms,
or at all. Delisting from Nasdaq could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of institutional investor interest
and fewer business development opportunities, as well as a limited amount of news and analyst coverage of us. Delisting could also result
in a determination that our shares of common stock are a penny stock, which would require brokers trading in our shares
of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary market
for our shares of common stock. In the event of a delisting, we would attempt to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq s
listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our shares of common stock to become
listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our securities, prevent our shares of common stock from dropping
below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements.
