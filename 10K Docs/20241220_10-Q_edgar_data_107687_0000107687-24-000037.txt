 operating segments: 1) Grand Design towables, 2) Winnebago towables, 3) Winnebago motorhomes, 4) Newmar motorhomes, 5) Grand Design motorhomes, 6) Chris-Craft marine, 7) Barletta marine, 8) Winnebago specialty vehicles, and 9) Lithionics. Financial performance is evaluated based on each operating segment's Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), as defined below, which excludes certain corporate administration expenses and non-operating income and expense. 
 
 Our reportable segments are: Towable RV (an aggregation of the Grand Design towables and the Winnebago towables operating segments); Motorhome RV (an aggregation of the Winnebago motorhomes, Newmar motorhomes, and Grand Design motorhomes operating segments); and Marine (an aggregation of the Chris-Craft marine and Barletta marine operating segments). Towable RV is comprised of non-motorized RV products that are generally towed by another vehicle, along with other related manufactured products and services. Motorhome RV is comprised of products that include a motorhome chassis, along with other related manufactured products and services. Marine is comprised of products that include boats, along with other related manufactured products and services. 
 
 The Corporate / All Other category includes the Winnebago specialty vehicles and Lithionics operating segments as well as certain corporate administration expenses related to the oversight of the enterprise, such as corporate leadership and administration costs. 
 
 Identifiable assets of the reportable segments exclude general corporate assets, which principally consist of cash and cash equivalents and certain deferred tax balances. The general corporate assets are included in the Corporate / All Other category. 
 
 Our Chief Executive Officer (the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM")) regularly reviews consolidated financial results in their entirety and operating segment financial information through Adjusted EBITDA and has ultimate responsibility for enterprise decisions. Our CODM is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the consolidated enterprise, reportable segments and between operating segments. Management of each operating segment has responsibility for operating decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance within their respective operating segment. The accounting policies of all reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024. 
 
 We monitor and evaluate operating performance of our reportable segments based on Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and other pretax adjustments made in order to present comparable results period over period. Examples of items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA include acquisition-related costs, contingent consideration fair value adjustment, and non-operating income or loss.

 Credit Agreements 
 On July 15, 2022, we amended and restated our asset-backed revolving credit agreement ("ABL Credit Facility") to, among other things, increase the commitments available from million to million and extend the maturity date from October 22, 2024 to July 15, 2027 (subject to certain factors which may accelerate the maturity date). The million credit facility is on a revolving basis, subject to availability under a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory. The ABL Credit Facility is available for issuance of letters of credit to a specified limit of million. We pay a commitment fee of based on the average daily amount of the facility available, but unused during the most recent quarter. We can elect to base

 , as well as an applicable spread between and , depending on the usage of the facility during the most recent quarter. Based on current usage, we would pay an applicable spread of . In connection with the amendment, we capitalized million of issuance costs that are being amortized over the term of the ABL Credit Facility. 
 
 Senior Secured Notes 
 On July 8, 2020, we closed our private offering (the Senior Secured Notes Offering of million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the Senior Secured Notes ). The Senior Secured Notes were issued in accordance with an Indenture dated as of July 8, 2020 (the Indenture ). The Senior Secured Notes will mature on July 15, 2028 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes accrues starting July 8, 2020 and is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, which began on January 15, 2021. 
 
 Debt issuance costs incurred and capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the associated debt agreement. If early principal payments are made on the Senior Secured Notes, a proportional amount of the unamortized debt issuance costs is expensed. As part of the Senior Secured Notes Offering, we capitalized million in debt issuance costs that are being amortized over the term of the agreement. 
 
 2030 Convertible Notes 
 On January 23, 2024, we issued million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2030 (the 2030 Convertible Notes ). The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Convertible Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers' transaction fees and offering expenses payable by us, were approximately million. The 2030 Convertible Notes bear interest at the annual rate of , payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2024, and will mature on January 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. 
 
 The 2030 Convertible Notes may be converted at any time on or after July 15, 2029, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding their maturity date. Upon conversion, we will settle the principal amount of the 2030 Convertible Notes in cash, and any conversion premium in excess of the principal amount in cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. 
 
 The initial conversion rate of the 2030 Convertible Notes was 11.3724 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2030 Convertible Notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of events specified in the Indenture to the 2030 Convertible Notes but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest on any 2030 Convertible Note being converted. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture to the 2030 Convertible Notes) during the make-whole fundamental change conversion period (as defined in the Indenture to the 2030 Convertible Notes), we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by the number of additional shares described in the Indenture to the 2030 Convertible Notes for a holder that elects to convert such holder s 2030 Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. As of November 30, 2024, there have been no changes to the initial conversion rate. 
 
 Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding July 15, 2029, the 2030 Convertible Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: 
 
 1. during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ended on March 31, 2024 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price (as defined in the Indenture to the 2030 Convertible Notes) per share of the common stock is more than of the applicable conversion price (as defined in the Indenture to the 2030 Convertible Notes) on each applicable trading day for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; 
 2. during the consecutive business day period immediately after any consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period to the 2030 Convertible Notes") in which the trading price (as defined in the 2030 Convertible Notes) per 1,000 principal amount of 2030 Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period to the 2030 Convertible Notes was less than of the product of the last reported sale price per share of the common stock and the conversion rate for the 2030 Convertible Notes on each such trading day; 
 3. upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate events set forth in the Indenture to the 2030 Convertible Notes; or 
 4. if we call such 2030 Convertible Notes for redemption (as described below). 
 
 The 2030 Convertible Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at our option at any time, and from time to time, on or after January 15, 2028 and on or before the th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for a

 million of debt issuance costs as well as the contractual interest expense are amortized using an effective interest rate of over the term of the 2030 Convertible Notes. We recorded million of interest expense during the three months ended November 30, 2024. 
 
 The net after-tax cost incurred in connection with the 2030 Call Spread Transactions was million. These transactions are classified as equity and are not remeasured each reporting period. 
 
 2025 Convertible Notes 
 On November 1, 2019, we issued million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 Convertible Notes ), of which million of aggregate principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes remain outstanding at November 30, 2024. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers' transaction fees and offering expense payable by us, were approximately million. The 2025 Convertible Notes bear interest at the annual rate of , payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2020, and will mature on April 1, 2025, unless earlier converted or repurchased by us. 
 
 The 2025 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 15.6906 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes. The 2025 Convertible Notes may be converted at any time on or after October 1, 2024, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. 
 
 The conversion rate of the 2025 Convertible Notes may be adjusted in certain circumstances, including in connection with a conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes made following certain fundamental changes and under other circumstances set forth in the Indenture to the 2025 Convertible Notes. As of November 30, 2024, the conversion rate was 16.2082 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately . The difference between the initial conversion rate and the conversion rate as of November 30, 2024 is due to cash dividends that have been declared following the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes. 
 
 It is our current intent to settle all conversions of the 2025 Convertible Notes in cash. Our ability to cash settle may be limited depending on the stock price at the time of conversion. 
 
 Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 1, 2024, the 2025 Convertible Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: 
 
 1. during any calendar quarter commencing after December 31, 2019 if the closing sale price of the common stock is more than of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; 
 2. during the consecutive business day period after any consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period to the 2025 Convertible Notes") in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period to the 2025 Convertible Notes was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate for the 2025 Convertible Notes on each such trading day; or

 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes using million of the net proceeds received from the 2030 Convertible Notes. In connection with the 2025 Convertible Note Repurchases, we recorded a loss on note repurchase of million in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income during the second quarter of Fiscal 2024. The loss on note repurchase represents the difference between the fair value of consideration transferred to the holders of the repurchased 2025 Convertible Notes and the conversion value of 2025 Convertible Notes repurchased pursuant to the original conversion terms. Concurrently with the 2025 Convertible Note Repurchases, we entered into agreements to terminate a proportionate amount of the 2025 Call Spread Transactions, which resulted in net proceeds of million recorded as equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Accounting Treatment of the 2025 Convertible Notes and Related 2025 Hedge Transactions and 2025 Warrant Transactions 
 The 2025 Convertible Notes are accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. Interest expense, representing the amortization of the remaining debt issuance costs as well as the contractual interest expense are amortized using an effective interest rate of over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. We recorded million and million of interest expense during the three months ended November 30, 2024 and November 25, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The 2025 Call Spread Transactions are classified as equity and are not remeasured each reporting period.

 months, provide that our liability will be the lesser of remaining principal owed by the dealer to the lending institution, or dealer invoice less periodic reductions based on the time since the date of the original invoice. Our liability cannot exceed of the dealer invoice. In certain instances, we also repurchase inventory from dealers due to state law or regulatory requirements that govern voluntary or involuntary relationship terminations. Although laws vary from state to state, some states have laws in place that require manufacturers of recreational vehicles or boats to repurchase current inventory if a dealership exits the business. The total contingent liability on all repurchase agreements was approximately million and million at November 30, 2024 and August 31, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Our loss reserve for repurchase commitments contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding a number of factors. Our risk of loss related to these repurchase commitments is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase and is spread over numerous dealers and lenders. The aggregate contingent liability related to our repurchase agreements represents all financed dealer inventory at the period-end reporting date subject to a repurchase agreement, net of the greater of periodic reductions per the agreement or dealer principal payments. Based on these repurchase agreements and our historical loss experience, an associated loss reserve is established, which is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our repurchase accrual was million and million at November 30, 2024 and August 31, 2024, respectively. Repurchase risk is affected by the credit worthiness of our dealer network. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to establish the loss reserve for repurchase commitments. 
 
 There was no material activity related to repurchase agreements during the three months ended November 30, 2024 and November 25, 2023.

 and for the three months ended November 30, 2024 and November 25, 2023, respectively. The change in our effective tax rate was driven primarily by the current year pre-tax book loss compared to pre-tax book income in the prior year. 
 
 As of November 30, 2024, million of U.S. federal income taxes receivable was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Comparatively, as of August 31, 2024, million of U.S. federal income taxes receivable was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 We file a U.S. Federal tax return, as well as returns in various international and state jurisdictions. As of November 30, 2024, our U.S. Federal returns from Fiscal 2021 to present are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service. With limited exceptions, U.S. state returns from Fiscal 2020 to present continue to be subject to review by state taxing jurisdictions. We are currently under review by certain U.S. state tax authorities for Fiscal 2020 through Fiscal 2023. We believe we have adequately reserved for our exposure to potential additional payments for uncertain tax positions in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits.

 (1) Earnings per share amounts are calculated based on unrounded numbers and therefore may not recalculate using the rounded numbers provided. 
 
 The dilutive effect of stock compensation awards, if any, was determined using the treasury stock method while the dilutive impact of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the 2030 Convertible Notes was determined using the if-converted method. Under the treasury stock method, shares associated with certain anti-dilutive securities have been excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding calculation because the exercise of those options would lead to a net reduction in common shares outstanding or anti-dilution. Under the if-converted method, the 2025 Convertible Notes are assumed to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, as the 2025 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If dilutive, the resulting shares are included in the denominator of the calculation and interest charges, net of any income tax effects are added back to the numerator of the calculation. For the 2030 Convertible Notes, we are required to settle the principal amount in cash and any conversion premium in excess of the principal amount in cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. As such, the 2030 Convertible Notes only have an impact on diluted earnings per share when the average share price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The terms "Winnebago," "we," "us," and "our," unless the context otherwise requires, refer to Winnebago Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. 
 
 Our MD A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024 (including the information presented therein under Risk Factors), as well as our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K and other publicly available information. All amounts herein are unaudited. All amounts are in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise noted. 

Overview 
 Winnebago Industries, Inc. is one of the leading North American manufacturers of recreation vehicles ("RVs") and marine products with a diversified portfolio used primarily in leisure travel and outdoor recreational activities. We also design and manufacture advanced battery solutions that deliver house power, supporting internal electrical features and appliances for a variety of outdoor products including RVs, boats, specialty and other low-speed vehicles, as well as other industrial applications. Other products manufactured by us consist primarily of original equipment manufacturing parts for other manufacturers and commercial vehicles. We produce our motorhome RV units in Iowa and Indiana; our towable RV units in Indiana; our marine units in Indiana and Florida; and our battery solutions in Florida. We distribute our RV and marine products primarily through independent dealers across the U.S. and Canada, who then retail the products to the end consumer. We also distribute our marine products internationally through independent dealers, who then retail the products to the end consumer. Our battery solutions are primarily sold to customers in the U.S. 
 
 Known Trends and Uncertainties 
 Our business continues to be challenged by macroeconomic conditions impacting retail consumers and our dealers, such as inflation and elevated interest rates. These factors have contributed to lower consumer spending and reduced short-term demand for large discretionary products such as RVs and marine products. In response, our dealers continue to exercise caution when managing stocking levels. In the first three months of Fiscal 2025, these trends resulted in decreased sales due to declines in unit volume. We expect that as consumer demand stabilizes, which we anticipate will occur as we enter the spring selling season, dealers will return to more stable ordering patterns. We continue to produce and ship in accordance with dealer demand as evidenced and requested by dealer orders. 
 
 Despite the current economic uncertainty, we believe in the long-term health of consumer demand for RV and marine products. 
 
 Segment Update 
 In conjunction with the Grand Design RV entrance into the motorized RV category, we established a Grand Design motorhomes operating segment in the first quarter of Fiscal 2025. This newly created operating segment is included in the Motorhome RV reportable segment. Prior period amounts have not been reclassified as the impact was not significant. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This MD A includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), as well as certain adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and other pretax adjustments made in order to present comparable results from period to period. 
 
 These non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, have been provided as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similar measures used by other companies. 
 
 Included in "Results of Operations" below for the three months ended November 30, 2024 compared to the comparable prior year period is a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We have included these non-GAAP performance measures as a comparable measure to illustrate the effect of non-recurring transactions that occurred during the reported periods and to improve comparability of our results from period to period. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance as this measure excludes 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 amounts from net (loss) income that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance. Examples of items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA include acquisition-related costs, contingent consideration fair value adjustment, and non-operating income or loss. 
 
 Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance and trends as well as our performance relative to competitors and peers; (b) to measure operational profitability on a consistent basis; (c) in presentations to the members of our Board of Directors to enable our Board of Directors to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as used by management in its assessments of performance and in forecasting; (d) to evaluate potential acquisitions; and (e) to ensure compliance with covenants and restricted activities under the terms of our ABL Credit Facility and outstanding notes, as further described in Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the industry.

 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to deleverage, higher warranty experience compared to the prior year and product mix, partially offset by operational efficiencies. 
 
 Operating expenses increased primarily due to strategic investments, partially offset by cost containment efforts. 
 
 The change in our effective tax rate was driven primarily by the current year pre-tax book loss compared to pre-tax book income in the prior year.

Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operations: Three Months Ended (in millions) November 30, 2024 November 25, 2023 Total cash used in: Operating activities (16.7) (21.4) Investing activities (8.0) (14.7) Financing activities (43.7) (54.2) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (68.4) (90.3) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 During the three months ended November 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 16.7 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of 21.4 million during the same period last year. The change in operating cash flow is primarily driven by favorable changes in inventory levels and a decrease in accounts receivable due to timing of invoicing and collections, partially offset by lower profitability adjusted for non-cash items and a decrease in accounts payable due to lower production levels. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to favorable changes in other investing activities and lower capital expenditures compared to the prior year. Other investing activities include cash proceeds from asset sales and certain strategic investments. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to lower share repurchases compared to the prior year.

Debt and Capital 
 We maintain a 350.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility ("ABL Credit Facility") with a maturity date of July 15, 2027, subject to certain factors which may accelerate the maturity date. As of November 30, 2024, we had no borrowings against the ABL Credit Facility. 
 
 As of November 30, 2024, we had 262.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and 350.0 million in unused ABL Credit Facility. Our cash and cash equivalent balances consist of high quality, short-term money market instruments. 
 
 On January 23, 2024, we issued 350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.25 unsecured convertible senior notes due 2030 (the "2030 Convertible Notes"). 
 
 On July 8, 2020, we closed our private offering (the Senior Secured Notes Offering of 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25 Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the Senior Secured Notes ). 
 
 On November 1, 2019, we issued 300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.50 unsecured Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Convertible Notes ). On January 18, 2024, we entered into privately negotiated transactions (the "2025 Convertible Note Repurchases") with certain holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes to repurchase 240.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes using proceeds received from the 2030 Convertible Notes. 
 
 As of November 30, 2024 , we had 59.2 million of net debt maturing in the next twelve months that is classified as current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 We believe cash flow from operations, existing lines of credit, and access to debt and capital markets will be sufficient to meet our current liquidity needs, and we have committed liquidity and cash reserves in excess of our anticipated funding requirements. We evaluate the financial stability of the counterparties for the 2030 Convertible Notes, the 2025 Convertible Notes, the Senior Secured Notes, and the ABL Credit Facility, and will continue to monitor counterparty risk on an on-going basis. 
 
 Working Capital 
 Working capital at November 30, 2024 and August 31, 2024 was 556.1 million and 584.0 million, respectively. We currently expect cash on hand, funds generated from operations, and the borrowing available under our ABL Credit Facility to be sufficient to cover both short-term and long-term operating requirements. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 We repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our Board of Directors. Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth, maintain a debt leverage ratio within our targeted zone, maintain reasonable liquidity, and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
 
 On August 17, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of 350.0 million with no time restriction on the authorization, which took effect immediately and replaced the prior program. In the three months ended November 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 533,000 shares of our own common stock at a cost of 30.0 million under this authorization, and approximately 62,000 shares at a cost of 3.6 million to satisfy tax obligations on employee equity awards vested. We continually evaluate if share repurchases reflect a prudent use of our capital and, subject to compliance with our ABL Credit Facility and Senior Secured Notes, we may purchase shares in the future. As of November 30, 2024, we have 200.0 million remaining on our Board approved repurchase authorization. 
 
 On December 18, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0.34 per share payable on January 29, 2025, to common stockholders of record at the close of business on January 15, 2025.
