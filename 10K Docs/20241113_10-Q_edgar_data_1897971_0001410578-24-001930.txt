The Public Shares subject to redemption are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 of the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem Public Shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against or abstain from voting on the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor and any of the Company s officers or directors that may hold Founder Shares (the Initial Shareholders have agreed (a) to vote their Founder Shares, Private Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of approving a Business Combination and (b) to waive their right to exercise redemptions rights with respect to any of their shares (including the Founder Shares) in connection with a shareholder vote to approve, or sell the shares to the Company in any tender offer in connection with, a proposed Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. The Initial Shareholders have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares, Private Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. The Company has until November 16, 2024 to consummate the initial Business Combination. In addition, if the Company is unable to consummate the initial Business Combination by November 16, 2024, the Sponsor (and/or its affiliates or designees) may, but is not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination twice by an additional each time (up to by May 16, 2025 to complete a Business Combination) (the Combination Period ), provided that, pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association and the trust agreement entered into between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company on November 13, 2023, the only way to extend the time available for the Company to consummate the initial business combination is for the Sponsor and/or it designee to deposit into the trust account per share), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. The Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association requires that such an amendment be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy at a general meeting. The public shareholders will not be afforded an opportunity to vote on the Company s extension of time to consummate an initial Business Combination beyond November 16, 2024, to February 16, 2025, up to May 16, 2025 as described above or redeem their shares in connection with such extensions.

 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then Public Shares issued and outstanding, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as public shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable laws. If the Company is forced to liquidate, the amount in the Trust Account (less the aggregate nominal par value of the shares of the Company s public shareholders) under the Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands (the Companies Act will be treated as share premium which is distributable under the Companies Act provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, the Company is able to pay the debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If the Company is forced to liquidate the Trust Account, the public shareholders would be distributed the amount in the Trust Account calculated as of the date that is prior to the distribution (including any accrued interest, net of taxes payable). The Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Private Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than per Public Share. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below per Public Share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a valid and enforceable agreement with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Going Concern Consideration As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of and working capital deficit of . Subsequent to the consummation of the IPO, the Company s liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to of such Working Capital Loans may be converted into units of the post Business Combination entity at a price of per unit (See Note 5).

 business days thereafter, redeem of the Company s outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (lesser tax payables and liquidation expenses up to ), and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, the Company may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of the Company s public shareholders. In the event of dissolution and liquidation, the Company s Rights will expire and will be worthless. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company s board of directors would proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company. There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate a Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period. As a result, management has determined that such additional condition also raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Risk and Uncertainties Additionally, as a result of the military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, the Company s ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. In October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and other terrorist organizations in parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks. The Company cannot currently predict the intensity or duration of Israel s war against Hamas, nor can predict how this war will ultimately affect the Company s ability to consummate a Business Combination. In addition, the Company s ability to consummate a Business Combination may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of these actions and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable. The unaudited condensed financial statement do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 in order to receive shares for all of the holders rights upon closing of a Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of a Business Combination. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly, the rights may expire worthless. The Company accounts for rights as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the right s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in FASB ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The assessment considers whether the rights are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the rights meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the rights are indexed to the Company s own ordinary shares and whether the right holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of right issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the rights are outstanding. For issued or modified rights that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the rights are required to be recorded as a component of equity at the time of issuance. For issued or modified rights that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the rights are required to be recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the rights are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. As the rights issued upon the IPO and private placements meet the criteria for equity classification under ASC 480, therefore, the rights are classified as equity.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, could, would, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, continue, or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings. References to the Company , us , our , or we refer to Global Lights Acquisition Corp. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and related notes herein. Overview We are a blank check company formed under the laws of Cayman Island on August 23, 2021, for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the initial public offering (the IPO ), our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt, in effecting an initial business combination. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location, while we intend to focus our search on a target that provides solutions promoting sustainable development and focuses on environmentally sound infrastructure and industrial applications that eliminate or mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and/or enhance resilience to climate change. We presently have no revenue, have had losses since inception from incurring formation and operating costs and have had no operations other than identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates. We have relied upon the working capital available to us following the consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) to fund our operations, as well as the funds loaned by the Sponsor (as defined below), our officers, directors or their affiliates. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. Initial Public Offering On August 23, 2021, our sponsor, Carbon Neutral Holdings Inc. (the Sponsor ), purchased 1,000,000 ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share of the Company (the Ordinary Shares for an aggregate purchase price of 100, or approximately 0.0001 per share.

On June 7, 2023, we repurchased and canceled 1,150,000 Ordinary Shares from the Sponsor at par value 0.0001 per share for an aggregate price of 115, and off-set the consideration receivable from the Sponsor, following which our Sponsor holds 1,725,000 Ordinary Shares (the Founder Shares ). On November 16, 2023, we consummated the IPO of 6,900,000 units (including 900,000 units issued upon the full exercise of the over-allotment option) (the Units ). Each Unit consists of one Ordinary Share, and one right (the Right ), with each one Right entitling the holder thereof to exchange for one-sixth (1/6) of one Ordinary Share upon the completion of the Company s initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 69,000,000. Substantially concurrently with the closing of the IPO, we completed the private sale (the Private Placement of 350,000 units (the Private Units to the Sponsor, at a purchase price of 10.00 per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 3,500,000. The proceeds of 69,345,000 (or 10.05 per Unit) from the proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement were placed in the trust account (the Trust Account established for the benefit of the Company s public shareholders and the underwriters of the IPO with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee.

Units not separated continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol GLACU. Recent Development On August 6, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of up to 300,000 to Mr. Zhizhuang Miao, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, (the Note A ). On August 6, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of up to 300,000 to Moore (Dalian) Technology Co., Ltd Moore ), whose 80 equity interest is owned by Mr. Zhizhuang Miao s spouse (the Note B and, together with the Note A, collectively, the Notes ). The proceeds of the Notes, which may be drawn down from time to time until the Company consummates its initial business combination, will be used for general working capital purposes, respectively. Each of the Notes bears no interest and is payable in full upon the earlier to occur of (i) the consummation of the Company s business combination or (ii) the date of expiry of the term of the Company (the Maturity Date ). The following shall constitute an event of default: (i) a failure to pay the principal within five business days of the Maturity Date; (ii) the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy action, (iii) the breach of the Company s obligations thereunder; (iv) any cross defaults; (v) an enforcement proceedings against the Company; and (vi) any unlawfulness and invalidity in connection with the performance of the obligations thereunder, in which case each Note may be accelerated.

Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 involved mainly searching for a target for an initial business combination. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. After the IPO, we incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for expenses associated with the search for target opportunities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 783,784, which comprised of income earned on investments held in Trust Account of 931,220, partially offset by operating costs of 147,436.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 16,575, which comprised of formation costs and operating costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 2,158,335, which comprised of income earned on investments held in Trust Account of 2,762,176, partially offset by operating costs of 603,841. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 68,446, which comprised of formation costs and operating costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 225,129. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1,191 available for working capital needs. As of September 30, 2024, none of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account was available to be withdrawn as described above. On November 16, 2023, we consummated IPO of 6,900,000 Units (including 900,000 Units issued upon the full exercise of the over-allotment option). Each Unit consists of one Ordinary Shares, and one Right, each one Right entitling the holder thereof to exchange for one-sixth of one Ordinary Share upon the completion of the Company s initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 69,000,000. On November 16, 2023, substantially concurrently with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the Private Placement of 350,000 Private Units to the Company s Sponsor, at a purchase price of 10.00 per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 3,500,000. The proceeds of 69,345,000 10.05 per unit) from the proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement were placed in the Trust Account. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the IPO, including the funds held in the Trust Account, to acquire a target business or businesses and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including deferred underwriting commissions of 2,415,00 payable to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, the representative of the underwriters of the IPO (the Deferred Underwriting Fees ). To the extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or finders fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our initial business combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. Over the next 12 months (assuming an initial business combination is not consummated prior thereto), we will be using the funds held outside of the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing business due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses, reviewing corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, selecting the target business to acquire and structuring, negotiating and consummating the initial business combination. The Company will have until November 16, 2024 (unless further extended) initially to consummate a business combination, which is less than one year from the date that the financial statement is issued as it expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and may needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. In addition, the Company s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements We had no obligations, assets or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.

Administrative Services Agreement We are obligated, commencing on November 14, 2023, to pay the Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, administrative and support services to such affiliate. Upon completion of a Business Combination or liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have recognized 90,000 and 0, respectively, of administrative service fee, which is included in formation and operating costs on the unaudited condensed statements of operations. Underwriting Agreement We are obligated to pay the underwriters a deferred underwriting fee equal to 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or 2,415,000, upon the closing of the Business Combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Financial Advisory Agreement On November 20, 2023, the Company entered into a financial advisory agreement with Macforth Industries (N) Ltd. to assist the Company in identifying potential investors by December 31,2024. The Company has prepaid 200,000 in cash on November 22, 2023, and incurred 30,770 in financial advisory fees in 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 46,155 and 138,465 in financial advisory fees, respectively, on the unaudited condensed statement of operations. Macforth Industries (N) Ltd. was entitled to a financial advisory fee equal to 2.0 of the financing proceeds upon the closing of a Business Combination, which was contingent on the closing of the Business Combination. On April 24, 2024, the Company and Macforth Industries (N) Ltd. entered into an amendment of the financial advisory agreement, pursuant to which, parties agree to cancel the 2.0 financial advisory fees as described above. Right of First Refusal We shall give the underwriters the right (but not the obligation) of first refusal to act as the sole provider, from the closing of the Business Combination through the eighteen (18) month anniversary thereof, of any arrangement or facility enabling the Company to raise capital through the sale or other distribution of its shares or any other equity-linked securities directly or indirectly (e.g., by sales of immediately registered shares) to the public markets. Registration Rights The Founder Shares, the Ordinary Shares included in the Private Units, and any Ordinary Shares that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any underlying securities) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration and shareholder rights agreement entered into in connection with the IPO. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our unaudited condensed financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical 

 26 

Table of Contents 
 experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We did not identify any critical accounting estimates. JOBS Act On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company , we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things: (1) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (3) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); and (4) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of the IPO or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvement to Income Tax Disclosure. This standard requires more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This standard also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public business entities, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. For entities other than public business entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025. Our management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on the financial statements and disclosures. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
