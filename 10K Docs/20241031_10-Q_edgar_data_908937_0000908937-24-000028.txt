 reporting units is performed as of the fourth quarter of each year, and an assessment is performed at other times if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , states that an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value. 
 In connection with the close of the Transactions our market capitalization sustained a decrease during the third quarter of 2024 and we concluded that, in accordance with ASC 350, a triggering event occurred indicating that potential impairment exists, which required us to conduct an interim test of the fair value of the goodwill for the Sirius XM and Pandora and Off-platform reporting units. In accordance with ASC 350, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, employing a discounted cash flow model, and a market approach, employing a guideline public company approach. The discounted cash flow model, which estimates fair value based on the present value of future cash flows, requires us to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of these cash flows, including growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for a projection period, plus the terminal value of the business at the end of the projection period. The terminal value is estimated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on expected trends and projections. A discount rate is determined for the reporting unit based on the risks of achieving the future cash flows, including risks applicable to the industry and market as a whole, as well as the capital structure of comparable entities. The results of our goodwill impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of the Pandora reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, whereas the carrying amount of the Sirius XM reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to write down the carrying amount of the Sirius XM goodwill in the Impairment, restructuring and other costs line item in our unaudited consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the cumulative balance of goodwill impairments recorded was , of which was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and is included in the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to our Sirius XM reporting unit and of which was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 and is included in the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to our Pandora and Off-platform reporting unit.

 Indefinite Life Intangible Assets 
 We have identified our Federal Communications Commission FCC licenses and XM and Pandora trademarks as indefinite life intangible assets after considering the expected use of the assets, the regulatory and economic environment within which they are used and the effects of obsolescence on their use. 
 We hold FCC licenses to operate our satellite digital audio radio service and provide ancillary services. Each of the FCC licenses authorizes us to use radio spectrum, a reusable resource that does not deplete or exhaust over time. 
 Our annual impairment assessment of our identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets is performed as of the fourth quarter of each year. An assessment is performed at other times if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible assets exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. As a result of the Sirius XM goodwill impairment discussed in Note 6, we evaluated our FCC licenses, Sirius XM trademark, and Pandora trademark for impairment using a quantitative assessment during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The results of the assessment indicated that the estimated fair values for these indefinite-lived assets exceeded their carrying values and impairment loss was recognized for intangible assets with indefinite lives during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Definite Life Intangible Assets 
 Amortization expense for all definite life intangible assets was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Sirius XM Canada 
 Sirius XM holds a equity interest and voting interest in Sirius XM Canada, a privately held corporation. We own shares of preferred stock of Sirius XM Canada, which has a liquidation preference of Canadian dollar per share. 
 Sirius XM Canada is accounted for as an equity method investment, and its results are not consolidated in our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

 On March 15, 2022, Sirius XM and Sirius XM Canada entered into an amended and restated services and distribution agreement. Pursuant to the amended and restated services and distribution agreement, the fee payable by Sirius XM Canada to Sirius XM was modified from a fixed percentage of revenue to a variable fee, based on a target operating profit for Sirius XM Canada. Such variable fee is expected to be evaluated annually based on comparable companies. In accordance with the amended and restated services and distribution agreement, the fee is payable on a monthly basis, in arrears, beginning January 1, 2022. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we evaluated our investment in Sirius XM Canada for impairment and determined that the carrying value of our equity method investment exceeded its fair value. We performed a quantitative impairment test and determined the fair value of our investment using a combination of an income approach, employing a discounted cash flow model, and a market approach, employing a guideline public company approach. The discounted cash flow model relies on making assumptions, such as expected growth in profitability and discount rate, which we believe are appropriate. As a result, we recorded an impairment of our equity method investment in Sirius XM Canada of . This loss from impairment was included in Impairment, restructuring and other costs within our unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 SplitCo Awards 
 Liberty Media granted, to certain of its directors and employees, restricted stock awards ("RSAs"), restricted stock units ("RSUs") and stock options to purchase shares of SplitCo common stock (collectively, "SplitCo Awards"). SplitCo measured the cost of employee services received in exchange for an equity classified SplitCo Award based on the grant-date fair value GDFV of the SplitCo Award and recognized that cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period of the SplitCo Award). SplitCo measured the cost of employee services received in exchange for a liability classified SplitCo Award based on the current fair value of the SplitCo Award and remeasures the fair value of the SplitCo Award at each reporting date. 
 At the time of the Split-Off, outstanding stock options to purchase shares of SplitCo common stock were accelerated and became fully vested and exchanged into stock options to purchase shares of our common stock adjusted based on the exchange ratio identified in the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Transitional Stock Adjustment Plan (the SplitCo Award Exchange Ratio ). The RSAs and RSUs with respect to shares of SplitCo common stock accelerated, became fully vested, and are treated as outstanding shares of our common stock and as such were exchanged into shares of our common stock based on the SplitCo Award Exchange Ratio. Following the Split-Off, a portion of the outstanding stock options to purchase shares of our common stock are to be settled in cash as the underlying shares were not registered, and therefore these awards were classified as liability awards and will be remeasured at each reporting date. As of September 30, 2024, we recognized a liability of related to these awards.

 Debt obligations. Debt obligations include principal payments on outstanding debt and finance lease obligations. 
 Cash interest payments. Cash interest payments include interest due on outstanding debt and finance lease payments through maturity. 
 Satellite and transmission. We have entered into agreements for the design, construction and launch of additional satellites, SXM-9, SXM-10, SXM-11 and SXM-12. We also have entered into agreements with third parties to operate and maintain satellite telemetry, tracking and control facilities and certain components of our terrestrial repeater networks. 
 Programming and content. We have entered into various programming and content agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, our obligations include fixed payments, advertising commitments and revenue sharing arrangements. In certain of these agreements, the future revenue sharing costs are dependent upon many factors and are difficult to estimate; therefore, they are not included in our minimum contractual cash commitments. 
 Sales and marketing. We have entered into various marketing, sponsorship and distribution agreements to promote our brands and are obligated to make payments to sponsors, retailers, automakers, radio manufacturers and other third parties under these agreements. Certain programming and content agreements also require us to purchase advertising on properties owned or controlled by the licensors. 
 Satellite incentive payments. Maxar Technologies (formerly Space Systems/Loral), the manufacturer of certain of our in-orbit satellites, may be entitled to future in-orbit performance payments upon XM-5, SIRIUS FM-5, SIRIUS FM-6, and SXM-8 meeting their design life, which we expect to occur. 
 Operating lease obligations. We have entered into both cancelable and non-cancelable operating leases for office space, terrestrial repeaters, data centers and equipment. These leases provide for minimum lease payments, additional operating expense charges, leasehold improvements and rent escalations that have initial terms ranging from one to , and certain leases have options to renew. 
 Royalties, Minimum Guarantees and Other. We have entered into music royalty arrangements that include fixed payments. In addition, certain of our podcast agreements also contain minimum guarantees. As of September 30, 2024, we had future fixed commitments related to music royalty and podcast agreements of , of which will be paid in 2024 and the remainder will be paid thereafter. On a quarterly basis, we record the greater of the cumulative actual content costs incurred or the cumulative minimum guarantee based on forecasts for the minimum guarantee period. The minimum guarantee period is the period of time that the minimum guarantee relates to, as specified in each agreement, which may be annual or a longer period. The cumulative minimum guarantee, based on forecasts, considers factors such as listening hours, downloads, revenue, subscribers and other terms of each agreement that impact our expected attainment or recoupment of the minimum guarantees based on the relative attribution method.

 as of September 30, 2024, of which is expected to be paid in 2024 and the remainder thereafter. 
 Several of our content agreements also include provisions related to the royalty payments and structures of those agreements relative to other content licensing arrangements, which, if triggered, cause our payments under those agreements to escalate. In addition, record labels, publishers and performing rights organizations with whom we have entered into direct license agreements have the right to audit our content payments, and such audits often result in disputes over whether we have paid the proper content costs. 
 We have also entered into various agreements with third parties for general operating purposes. 
 In addition to the minimum contractual cash commitments described above, we have entered into other variable cost arrangements. These future costs are dependent upon many factors and are difficult to anticipate; however, these costs may be substantial. We may enter into additional programming, distribution, marketing and other agreements that contain similar variable cost provisions. We do not have any other significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant or party to various claims and lawsuits, including those discussed below. 
 
 We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of a loss or potential loss. We may be unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss for a particular legal contingency for various reasons, including, among others, because: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the relative early stages; (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending proceedings (including motions and appeals); (iv) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of settlement and the outcome of any negotiations with respect thereto; (v) there remain significant factual issues to be determined or resolved; (vi) the relevant law is unsettled; or (vii) the proceedings involve novel or untested legal theories. In such instances, there may be considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of such matters, including the likelihood or magnitude of a possible eventual loss, if any. 
 
 New York State v. Sirius XM Radio Inc. On December 20, 2023, the People of the State of New York, by Letitia James, Attorney General of the State of New York (the NY AG ), filed a Petition in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Sirius XM. The Petition alleges various violations of New York law and the federal Restore Online Shoppers Confidence Act ROSCA arising out of Sirius XM's subscription cancellation practices. In general, the Petition alleges that Sirius XM requires consumers to devote an excessive amount of time to cancel subscriptions and have not implemented cancellation processes that are simple and efficient. 
 
 The Petition claims to be brought under certain provisions of New York law that authorize the NY AG to initiate special proceedings seeking injunctive and other equitable relief in cases of persistent business fraud or illegality. The Petition seeks: a permanent injunction against violating provisions of New York law and ROSCA arising out of the alleged deceptive practices associated with Sirius XM's subscription cancellation procedures; an accounting of each consumer who cancelled, or sought to cancel, a satellite radio subscription, including the duration of the cancel interaction and the funds collected from such consumers after that interaction; monetary restitution and damages to aggrieved consumers; disgorgement of all profits resulting from the alleged improper acts; civil penalties; and the NY AG s costs. 
 
 In March 2024, Sirius XM filed its Answer to the Petition which was supported by various factual declarations and asserts affirmative defenses to the allegations contained in the Petition. In connection with the Answer, Sirius XM cross moved for summary judgment with respect to various claims asserted in the Petition. In April 2024, the NY AG filed its responsive pleadings in support of the Petition and in opposition to Sirius XM s cross motion for summary judgment. In May 2024, Sirius

On July 3, 2024, those petitioners filed an amended petition seeking the same relief on behalf of a revised list of petitioners. The Court has not taken any action in connection with the amended petition. 
 On June 14, 2024, Kara Kirkpatrick, Gillian Maxfield, Anna Demarco and Cody Michael, individually and on behalf of all other Oregon persons similarly situated, filed a class action complaint against Sirius XM in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. 
 On June 21, 2024, Cindy Balmores, Justin Braswell, Deborah Garvin, and Thea Anderson, individually, as private attorneys general, and on behalf of all other Washington persons similarly situated, filed a class action complaint against Sirius XM in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.

 claimants. Several of the law firms have asserted additional causes of action under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. 
 
 Sirius XM believes it has substantial defenses to the claims asserted in these actions and arbitrations, and it intends to defend these actions vigorously. 
 
 Other Matters . In the ordinary course of business, Sirius XM Holdings, Sirius XM and its subsidiaries, such as Pandora, are defendants in various other lawsuits and arbitration proceedings, including derivative actions; actions filed by subscribers, both on behalf of themselves and on a class action basis; former employees; parties to contracts or leases; and owners of purported patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. None of these other matters, in our opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

 and , respectively, included in other current liabilities in our unaudited consolidated balance sheet. 
 In connection with the Transactions, we entered into a new Tax Sharing Agreement with Liberty Media. The Tax Sharing Agreement generally allocates taxes, tax benefits, tax items, and tax-related losses between Liberty Media and us in a manner consistent with the tax sharing policies of Liberty Media in effect prior to the Split-Off, with taxes, tax benefits and tax items attributable to the assets, liabilities and activities attributed to the Liberty Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group being allocated to Liberty Media, and taxes, tax benefits and tax items attributable to the assets, liabilities and activities attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group being allocated to us. In addition, the Tax Sharing Agreement includes additional provisions related to the manner in which any taxes or tax-related losses arising from the Split-Off will be allocated between the parties and provides restrictive covenants intended to preserve the generally tax-free treatment of the Transactions. The failure by a party to comply with its restrictive covenants may change the general allocation of taxes, tax benefits and tax items between the parties related to the Transactions. The parties must indemnify each other for taxes and losses allocated to them under the Tax Sharing Agreement and for taxes and losses arising from a breach by them of their respective covenants and obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement. The Tax Sharing Agreement also includes provisions addressing the filing of tax returns, control of tax audits, cooperation on tax matters, retention of tax records, indemnification, and other tax matters. 
 Income tax benefit (expense) was and ) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and ) and ) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and ) , respectively. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was ) and ) , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by the nondeductible Sirius XM goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by tax losses related to share-based compensation and an increase in valuation allowance and net operating loss expirations related to state net operating losses that are projected to expire unutilized. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily impacted by the release of valuation reserves against state net operating losses we now expect to realize and benefits related to certain tax credits. We estimate our effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2024 will be approximately . 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net tax benefits of and , respectively, related to our tax equity investments. These recognized net tax benefits were recorded to Income tax expense in our unaudited

 reportable segments: Sirius XM and Pandora and Off-platform. The financial results of these segments are utilized by the chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources.

For additional information on our segments refer to Note 1. 
 Segment results include the revenues and cost of services which are directly attributable to each segment. There are no indirect revenues or costs incurred that are allocated to the segments.

Sirius XM Revenue 
 Sirius XM Subscriber Revenue includes fees charged for self-pay and paid promotional subscriptions, U.S. Music Royalty Fees and other ancillary fees. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, subscriber revenue was 1,510 and 1,597, respectively, a decrease of 5 , or 87. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, subscriber revenue was 4,576 and 4,757, respectively, a decrease of 4 , or 181. The decreases were primarily driven by a reduction in self-pay revenue resulting from a decline in average subscribers as well as a lower ARPU driven by an increase in subscribers on self-pay promotional and streaming-only self-pay subscription plans and a reduction in paid promotional revenue. 
 We expect subscriber revenues to decrease due to a decline in average subscribers as well as the average price of our subscriptions. 
 Sirius XM Advertising Revenue includes the sale of advertising on Sirius XM s non-music channels. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, advertising revenue was 41 and 42, respectively, a decrease of 2 , or 1. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, advertising revenue was 124 and 126, respectively, a decrease of 2 , or 2. Lower revenue from entertainment channels was partially offset by higher revenue earned on news channels. 
 We expect our Sirius XM advertising revenue to increase as we continue to promote our brand and as a result of co-selling initiatives among our brands and platforms. 
 Sirius XM Equipment Revenue includes revenue and royalties from the sale of satellite radios, components and accessories. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, equipment revenue was 43 and 49, respectively, a decrease of 12 , or 6. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, equipment revenue was 140 and 142, respectively, a decrease of 1 , or 2. The decreases were driven by a transition to higher cost next generation chipsets. For the nine month period, the decrease was partially offset by increased chipset production. 
 We expect equipment revenue to remain flat as higher costs associated with the transition to our next generation chipset are anticipated to offset increased production. 
 Sirius XM Other Revenue includes service and advisory revenue from Sirius XM Canada, revenue from our connected vehicle services, and ancillary revenues. 
 For each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other revenue was 33. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other revenue was 93 and 99, respectively, a decrease of 6 , or 6. The decrease for the nine month period was driven by lower royalty revenue from Sirius XM Canada. 
 We expect other revenue to continue to decrease primarily due to lower revenue from our connected vehicle services. 
 Pandora and Off-platform Revenue 
 Pandora and Off-platform Subscriber Revenue includes fees charged for Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Pandora and Off-platform subscriber revenue was 135 and 132, respectively, an increase of 2 , or 3. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Pandora and Off-platform subscriber revenue was 407 and 389, respectively, an increase of 5 , or 18. The positive results were driven by rate increases on Pandora subscription plans, partially offset by a decline in the subscriber base. 
 We expect Pandora and Off-platform subscriber revenues to remain relatively flat as higher ARPU is anticipated to be offset by a lower subscriber base.

Table of Contents 

Pandora and Off-platform Advertising Revenue is generated primarily from audio, display and video advertising from on-platform and off-platform advertising. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Pandora and Off-platform advertising revenue was 409 and 418, respectively, a decrease of 2 , or 9. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Pandora and Off-platform advertising revenue was 1,171 and 1,152, respectively, an increase of 2 , or 19. The decrease for the three month period was driven by a number of factors, including lower streaming demand due to new supply entering the market. The increase for the nine month period was primarily driven by higher podcasting revenue and technology fees as well as higher sell-through on the Pandora ad-supported service, partially offset by the market factors described above. 
 We expect Pandora and Off-platform advertising revenue to increase due to growth in podcast and programmatic revenue. 
 Total Revenue 
 Total Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2,171 and 2,271, respectively, a decrease of 4 , or 100. Total Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 6,511 and 6,665, respectively, a decrease of 2 , or 154.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue share and royalties were 1,176 and 1,201, respectively, a decrease of 2 , or 25, but increased as a percentage of total Sirius XM revenue. The decreases were driven by lower subscription revenue, partially offset by higher web streaming royalty rates. 
 We expect our Sirius XM revenue share and royalty costs to remain flat as a percentage of revenue but to decrease overall due to lower eligible subscription revenue, partially offset by higher royalty rates under the statutory webcasting license resulting from increases in the Consumer Price Index. 
 Sirius XM Programming and Content includes costs to acquire, create, promote and produce content. We have entered into various agreements with third parties for music and non-music programming that require us to pay license fees and other amounts. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, programming and content expenses were 137 and 136, respectively, an increase of 1 , or 1, and increased as a percentage of total Sirius XM revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, programming and content expenses were 412 and 407, respectively, an increase of 1 , or 5, and increased as a percentage of total Sirius XM revenue.

 We expect our Sirius XM programming and content expenses to slightly increase due to higher license fees.

The decreases were primarily driven by lower call center costs, transaction and payment processing fees, bad debt expense, and personnel-related costs. 
 We expect our Sirius XM customer service and billing expenses to increase as a result of higher subscriber management system transitional costs, partially offset by lower call center and personnel-related costs. 
 Sirius XM Transmission consists of costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our terrestrial repeater networks; satellites; satellite telemetry, tracking and control systems; satellite uplink facilities; studios; and delivery of our Internet and 360L streaming and connected vehicle services. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, transmission expenses were 48 and 44, respectively, an increase of 9 , or 4, and increased as a percentage of total Sirius XM revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, transmission expenses were 147 and 126, respectively, an increase of 17 , or 21, and increased as a percentage of total Sirius XM revenue. The increases were primarily driven by higher hosting costs associated with our streaming platform as well as higher consulting costs. 
 We expect our Sirius XM transmission expenses to fluctuate as rising costs associated with consumers using our new platforms are offset by investments in internet streaming. 
 Sirius XM Cost of Equipment includes costs from the sale of satellite radios, components and accessories and provisions for inventory allowance attributable to products purchased for resale in our direct to consumer distribution channels. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of equipment was 2 and 3, respectively, a decrease of 33 , or 1, and decreased as a percentage of total Sirius XM revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of equipment was 7 and 10, respectively, a decrease of 30 , or 3, and decreased as a percentage of total Sirius XM revenue. The decreases were driven by fewer sales of satellite radios as well as related components and lower shipping costs. 
 We expect our Sirius XM cost of equipment to decrease as sales of our satellite radios decline. 
 Pandora and Off-platform Cost of Services 
 Pandora and Off-platform Cost of Services includes revenue share and royalties, programming and content, customer service and billing, and transmission expenses. 
 Pandora and Off-platform Revenue Share and Royalties includes licensing fees paid for streaming music or other content costs related to podcasts as well as revenue share paid to third party ad servers. We make payments to third party ad servers for the period the advertising impressions are delivered or click-through actions occur, and accordingly, we record this as a cost of service in the related period. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue share and royalties were 317 and 325, respectively, a decrease of 2 , or 8, and decreased as a percentage of total Pandora and Off-platform revenue.

The decrease for the three month period was primarily due to lower sound recording royalties. The decrease for the nine month period was primarily due to lower revenue share related to podcasts.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, subscriber acquisition costs were 90 and 87, respectively, an increase of 3 , or 3, and increased as a percentage of total revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, subscriber acquisition costs were 272 and 270, respectively, an increase of 1 , or 2, and increased as a percentage of total revenue. The increases were driven by contractual changes with certain automakers, partially offset by lower hardware subsidies driven by installations as well as lower commission and hardware subsidy rates. 
 We expect subscriber acquisition costs to increase driven by growth in penetration with certain automakers as well as higher subsidies and other incentives offered to induce automakers to include our latest technology in their vehicles. 
 Sales and Marketing includes costs for marketing, advertising, media and production, including promotional events and sponsorships; cooperative and artist marketing; and personnel related costs including salaries, commissions, and sales support.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 138 and 139, respectively, a decrease of 1 , or 1, but increased as a percentage of total revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 378 and 468, respectively, a decrease of 19 , or 90, and decreased as a percentage of total revenue. The decreases were primarily driven by lower legal costs resulting from litigation insurance recoveries and reduced legal reserves, including amounts associated with settlement of certain litigation matters of 24 during the three months ended June 30, 2023 as well as lower Former Parent operating costs. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses, excluding litigation insurance recoveries, to remain relatively flat as higher technology and consulting costs will be offset by lower personnel-related costs and the exclusion of Former Parent operating costs going forward. 
 Depreciation and Amortization represents the recognition in earnings of the cost of assets used in operations, including our satellite constellations, property, equipment and intangible assets, over their estimated service lives. 
 For each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation and amortization expense was 145. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation and amortization expense was 455 and 460, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the retirement of a satellite during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and certain assets that reached the end of their useful lives, partially offset by the write-down of certain property and equipment recorded in the Transactions and an increase in capitalized software and hardware. 
 Impairment, Restructuring and Other Costs represents impairment charges, associated with the carrying amount of an asset exceeding the asset's fair value, restructuring expenses associated with the abandonment of certain leased office spaces as well as employee severance charges associated with organizational changes, and costs associated with the Transaction. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, impairment, restructuring and other costs were 3,388 and 6, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, impairment, restructuring and other costs were 3,441 and 56, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded impairment charges of 3,353 related to impairment of Goodwill and non-controlling investments, costs associated with the Transactions of 32 and a charge of 3 associated with severance and other restructuring costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded impairment charges of 3,354 primarily related to impairment of Goodwill and non-controlling investments, costs associated with the Transactions of 68, and a charge of 19 associated with severance and other restructuring costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded restructuring costs of 5 and transaction costs of 1. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a charge of 31 primarily related to severance and other related costs, impairments primarily related to terminated software projects of 15, vacated office space impairments of 5, accrued expenses of 2 for

which we will not recognize any future benefits, a cost-method investment impairment of 2, and costs related to the Transactions of 1. 
 Other (Expense) Income 
 Interest Expense includes interest on outstanding debt. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense was 124 and 134, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense was 379 and 404, respectively. The decreases were driven by a lower average outstanding debt balance and higher capitalized interest. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), Net primarily includes realized and unrealized gains and losses from our debt measured at fair value, bond hedges, Deferred Compensation Plan and other investments, intergroup interests, interest and dividend income, our share of the income or loss from equity investments, and transaction costs related to non-operating investments. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income (expense), net was 28 and (51), respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income (expense) was 142 and (17), respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded unrealized gains on debt measured at fair value, earnings on unconsolidated entity investments, and trading gains associated with the investments held for our Deferred Compensation Plan. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded unrealized losses on debt measured at fair value and losses associated with bond hedges, partially offset by earnings on unconsolidated entity investments, and trading gains associated with the investments held for our Deferred Compensation Plan. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded losses associated with bond hedges, partially offset by unrealized gains on debt measured at fair value, gains associated with the fair value of intergroup interests, earnings on unconsolidated entity investments, and trading gains associated with the investments held for our Deferred Compensation Plan. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income Tax Expense includes the change in our deferred tax assets, current federal and state tax expenses, and foreign withholding taxes. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income tax benefit (expense) was 39 and (79), respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income tax expense was (103) and (199), respectively. 
 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.3 and (21.4) , respectively. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (4.6) and (20.8) , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by the nondeductible Sirius XM goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by tax losses related to share-based compensation and an increase in valuation allowance and net operating loss expirations related to state net operating losses that are projected to expire unutilized. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily impacted by the release of valuation reserves against state net operating losses we now expect to realize and benefits related to certain tax credits. We estimate our effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2024 will be approximately 21 .

Key Financial and Operating Performance Metrics 
 In this section, we present certain financial performance measures, some of which are presented as Non-GAAP items, which include free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. We also present certain operating performance measures. Our adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of share-based payment expense. Additionally, when applicable, our adjusted EBITDA metric excludes the effect of significant items that do not relate to the on-going performance of our business. We use these Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures to manage our business, to set operational goals and as a basis for determining performance-based compensation for our employees. See the accompanying Glossary for more details and for the reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure (where applicable). 
 We believe these Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures provide useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations. We believe these Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures may be useful to investors in evaluating our core trends because they provide a more direct view of our underlying costs. We believe investors may use our adjusted EBITDA to estimate our current enterprise value and to make investment decisions. We believe free cash flow provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our cash available for future subscriber acquisitions and capital expenditures, to repurchase or retire debt, to acquire other companies and our ability to return capital to stockholders. By providing these Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures, together with the reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure (where applicable), we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business and our results of operations. 
 Our Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for or superior to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures by other companies. Please refer to the Glossary for a further discussion of such Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure (where applicable). Subscribers and subscription related revenues and expenses associated with our connected vehicle services and Sirius XM Canada are not included in Sirius XM's subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics. Subscribers to the Cloud Cover music programming service are now included in Pandora's subscriber count.

Sirius XM 
 Subscribers. At September 30, 2024, Sirius XM had approximately 33,156 subscribers, a decrease of 813, from the approximately 33,969 subscribers as of September 30, 2023. Our self-pay subscriber base declined as a result of lower vehicle conversion rates, partially offset by lower non-pay and vehicle related churn. We also saw a decrease in paid promotional subscribers as certain automakers transitioned from paid promotional subscriptions to unpaid or to shorter term promotional plans. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net subscriber additions were (100) and (94), respectively, a decrease of 6. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net subscriber additions were (719) and (336), respectively, a decrease of 383. Paid promotional net additions decreased compared to the prior year periods as certain automakers transitioned from paid promotional subscriptions to unpaid. Self-pay net additions improved for the three and nine month periods compared to the prior year primarily due to lower churn. 
 Sirius XM Canada Subscribers. At September 30, 2024, Sirius XM Canada had approximately 2,559 subscribers, a decrease of 102, or 4 , from the approximately 2,661 Sirius XM Canada subscribers as of September 30, 2023. 
 Average Self-pay Monthly Churn is derived by dividing the monthly average of self-pay deactivations for the period by the average number of self-pay subscribers for the period. (See accompanying Glossary for more details.) 
 For each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our average self-pay monthly churn rate was 1.6 . For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our average self-pay monthly churn rate was 1.6 . 
 ARPU is derived from total earned Sirius XM subscriber revenue (excluding revenue derived from our connected vehicle services) and net advertising revenue, divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the daily weighted average number of subscribers for the period. (See the accompanying Glossary for more details.) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, ARPU was 15.16 and 15.69, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, ARPU was 15.25 and 15.54, respectively. The decreases were driven by an increase in self-pay subscribers on promotional and streaming-only self-pay subscription plans. 
 SAC, Per Installation, is derived from subscriber acquisition costs and margins from the sale of radios, components and accessories (excluding connected vehicle services), divided by the number of satellite radio installations in new vehicles and shipments of aftermarket radios for the period. (See the accompanying Glossary for more details.) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, SAC, per installation, was 14.67 and 12.46, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, SAC, per installation, was 13.65 and 13.53, respectively. The increases were driven by a transition to higher cost chipsets, partially offset by a change in the mix of automakers including satellite radios in their vehicles. 
 Pandora and Off-platform 
 Monthly Active Users. At September 30, 2024, Pandora had approximately 43,721 monthly active users, a decrease of 2,779 monthly active users, or 6 , from the 46,500 monthly active users as of September 30, 2023. The decrease in monthly active users was driven by churn and a decline in the number of new users. 
 Subscribers. At September 30, 2024, Pandora had approximately 5,875 subscribers, a decrease of 285, or 5 , from the approximately 6,160 subscribers as of September 30, 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net subscriber additions were (76) and (110), respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net subscriber additions were (178) and (92), respectively. The decrease in ending subscribers was driven by decreases in trial starts and lower retention due to certain price increases. 
 Ad supported listener hours are a key indicator of our Pandora business and the engagement of our Pandora listeners. We include ad supported listener hours related to Pandora's non-music content offerings in the definition of listener hours. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, ad supported listener hours were 2,466 and 2,638, respectively, a decrease of 7 , or 172. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, ad supported listener hours were 7,550 and 7,952, respectively, a decrease of 5 , or 402. The decreases in ad supported listener hours were primarily driven by the decline in monthly active users.

RPM is a key indicator of our ability to monetize advertising inventory created by listener hours on the Pandora services. Ad RPM is calculated by dividing advertising revenue by the number of thousands of listener hours of our Pandora advertising-based service. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, RPM was 104.50 and 104.33, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, RPM was 98.12 and 95.61, respectively. The increases were driven by growth in the demand for programmatic advertising. 
 Total Company 
 Adjusted EBITDA. A djusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of other expense (income), loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment, restructuring and other costs, Former Parent operating costs, other non-cash charges such as share-based payment expense, and legal settlements and reserves (if applicable). (See the accompanying Glossary for a reconciliation to GAAP and for more details.) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, adjusted EBITDA was 693 and 747, respectively, a decrease of 7 , or 54. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, adjusted EBITDA was 2,043 and 2,075, respectively, a decrease of 2 , or 32. The decreases were driven by declines in subscriber revenue, partially offset by lower costs of services, personnel-related costs, and general and administrative expenses. 
 Free Cash Flow includes cash provided by operations, net of additions to property and equipment, and restricted and other investment activity. (See the accompanying Glossary for a reconciliation to GAAP and for more details.) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, free cash flow was 93 and 258, respectively, a decrease of 64 , or 165. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, free cash flow was 499 and 780, respectively, a decrease of 36 , or 281. The decreases for the three and nine month periods were primarily driven by costs related to the Transactions, lower cash receipts, higher programming payments, and higher capital expenditures; partially offset by lower cash taxes paid. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 
 2024 2023 2024 vs 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,062 1,301 (239) Net cash used in investing activities (792) (565) (227) Net cash used in financing activities (450) (771) 321 Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (180) (35) (145) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 315 370 (55) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 135 335 (200) 
 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by 239 to 1,062 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,301 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our largest source of cash provided by operating activities is cash generated by subscription and subscription-related revenues. We also generate cash from the sale of advertising through the Pandora and Off-platform business, advertising on certain non-music channels on Sirius XM and the sale of satellite radios, components and accessories. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include revenue share and royalty payments to distributors, programming and content providers, and payments to radio manufacturers, distributors and automakers. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include payments to vendors to service, maintain and acquire listeners and subscribers, general corporate expenditures, and compensation and related costs.

Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
 Cash flows used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to spending for capitalized software and hardware, the construction of satellites and acquisitions of tax-effective investments for total cash consideration of 229. Cash flows used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to spending for capitalized software and hardware, the construction of satellites and acquisitions of tax-effective equity investments for total cash consideration of 44. We spent 305 and 212 on capitalized software and hardware as well as 229 and 261 to construct satellites during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities 
 Cash flows used in financing activities consists of the issuance and repayment of long-term debt, purchases of our common stock, the payment of cash dividends and taxes paid in lieu of shares issued for stock-based compensation. Proceeds from long-term debt have been used to fund our operations, construct and launch new satellites, fund acquisitions, invest in other infrastructure improvements and purchase shares of our common stock. 
 Cash flows used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to the repayment of 2,797 of debt, partially offset by proceeds from debt borrowings of 2,451. The remaining cash flows used in financing activities related to taxes paid from net share settlements for stock-based compensation and dividends paid. Long-term debt proceeds and repayments are reported gross within the statement of cash flows and primarily relate to the Margin Loan and the Credit Facility. 
 Cash flows used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to the repayment of 3,306 of debt and the purchase and retirement of shares of Sirius XM Holdings common stock under its repurchase program of 274, partially offset by proceeds from debt borrowings of 2,601, and settlement of intergroup interests of 273. Long-term debt proceeds and repayments are reported gross within the statement of cash flows and primarily relate to Liberty Media s 1.375 Cash Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, the Convertible Notes, the Exchangeable Notes, the Margin Loan, and the Credit Facility. 
 Future Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements 
 Based upon our current business plans, we expect to fund operating expenses, capital expenditures, including the construction of replacement satellites, working capital requirements, interest payments, taxes and scheduled maturities of our debt with existing cash, cash flow from operations and borrowings under the Credit Facility, including the Incremental Term Loan. As of September 30, 2024, 1,500 was available for future borrowing under the Credit Facility and 490 was available under the Incremental Term Loan. We believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents, as well as debt capacity, to cover our estimated short and long-term funding needs, including amounts to construct, launch and insure replacement satellites, as well as fund future stock repurchases and dividend payments and to pursue strategic opportunities. 
 Our ability to meet our debt and other obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors. 
 We regularly evaluate our business plans and strategy. These evaluations often result in changes to our business plans and strategy, some of which may be material and significantly change our cash requirements. These changes in our business plans or strategy may include: the acquisition of unique or compelling programming; the development and introduction of new features or services; significant new or enhanced distribution arrangements; investments in infrastructure, such as satellites, equipment or radio spectrum; and acquisitions and investments, including acquisitions and investments that are not directly related to our existing business. 
 We may from time to time purchase our outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Purchases or retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 In connection with the Transactions, holders of the Exchangeable Notes have the right to require us to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes at a purchase price equal to the adjusted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and any final period distribution. We expect to use the proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan to refinance the Exchangeable Notes. 
 W e have made, and expect to continue to make, certain tax-efficient equity investments in clean energy technologies, including industrial carbon capture and storage. These investments will produce tax credits and related tax losses. The payments on these equity investments will be classified as investing activities from a cash flow perspective, while the tax credits and losses will benefit our federal cash taxes in operating activities.

Stock Repurchase Program 
 As of September 30, 2024, our board of directors had approved for repurchase an aggregate of 1,166 of our common stock. The board of directors did not establish an end date for this stock repurchase program. Shares of common stock may be purchased from time to time on the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under theExchange Act, in privately negotiated transactions, including in accelerated stock repurchase transactions, or otherwise. We intend to fund any stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and future borrowings. The size and timing of any purchases will be based on a number of factors, including price and business and market conditions. 
 We did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Prior to the closing of the Transactions, the board of directors of Old Sirius had approved the repurchase of an aggregate of 18,000 of its common stock. As of the closing of the Transactions, Old Sirius' cumulative repurchases since December 2012 under that stock repurchase program totaled 373 shares for 16,834, and 1,166 remained available under that stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase program of Old Sirius was terminated on the closing date of the Transactions.

 Debt Covenants 
 The indentures governing Sirius XM's senior notes and the agreements governing the Sirius XM Credit Facility include restrictive covenants. The indentures governing the senior notes also contain covenants that, among other things, limit Sirius XM s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to create certain liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and merge or consolidate. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with such covenants. For a discussion of our Debt Covenants, refer to Note 11 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Glossary 
 Self-pay subscriber - A self-pay subscriber is a user that, as of the date of determination, was party to a customer agreement with SiriusXM or Pandora, and (i) has paid or agreed to pay a subscription fee, including at a promotional price, or (ii) the subscription fee has been paid by an automaker for a period of three years or greater. Lifetime subscribers to the SiriusXM service are counted as self-pay subscribers because they are party to a customer agreement with SiriusXM and have paid a subscription fee, although in almost all cases the revenue from such subscriptions have been fully recognized in prior periods. Certain users that are party to a customer agreement with Sirius XM or Pandora and have paid or agreed to pay a small promotional price for a trial subscription are not counted as self-pay subscribers because the promotional price is considered to be de minimis and, in management's view, the payment is not indicative of the user's intent to subscribe to the service in the near-term. 
 Paid promotional subscriber - A paid promotional subscriber is a user that, as of the date of determination, has their subscription fee paid for by a third party, for a fixed trial subscription period, which typically range from one to twelve months but is less than three years. We count prepaid shipped but not activated vehicles as paid promotional subscribers. 
 Monthly active users - the number of distinct registered users on the Pandora services, including subscribers, which have consumed content within the trailing 30 days to the end of the final calendar month of the period. The number of monthly active users on the Pandora services may overstate the number of unique individuals who actively use our Pandora service, as one individual may use multiple accounts. To become a registered user on the Pandora services, a person must sign-up using an email address or access our service using a device with a unique identifier, which we use to create an account for our service. 
 Average self-pay monthly churn - for satellite-enabled subscriptions, the Sirius XM monthly average of self-pay deactivations for the period divided by the average number of self-pay subscribers for the period. 
 Adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or adjusts for the impact of other expense (income), gain on extinguishment of debt, impairment, restructuring and other costs, Former Parent operating costs, other non-cash charges such as share-based payment expense, and legal settlements and reserves (if applicable). We believe adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the underlying trend of our operating performance, which provides useful information about our business apart from the costs associated with our capital structure and purchase price accounting. We believe investors find this Non-GAAP financial measure useful when analyzing our past operating performance with our current performance and comparing our operating performance to the performance of other communications, entertainment and media companies. We believe investors use adjusted EBITDA to estimate our current enterprise value and to make investment decisions. As a result of large capital investments in our satellite radio system, our results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation expense. We believe the exclusion of share-based payment expense is useful as it is not directly related to the operational conditions of our business. We also believe the exclusion of the legal settlements and reserves, impairment, restructuring and other costs, to the extent they occur during the period, is useful as they are significant expenses not incurred as part of our normal operations for the period.

Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income of certain expenses, including share-based payment expense. We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the Non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the Non-GAAP measure. Investors that wish to compare and evaluate our operating results after giving effect for these costs should refer to net income as disclosed in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Since adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial performance measure, our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be susceptible to varying calculations; may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies; and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net (loss) income to the adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows:

Free cash flow - is derived from cash flow provided by operating activities, net of additions to property and equipment and purchases of other investments. Free cash flow is a metric that our management and board of directors use to evaluate the cash generated by our operations, net of capital expenditures and other investment activity. In a capital intensive business, with significant investments in satellites, we look at our operating cash flow, net of these investing cash outflows, to determine cash available for future subscriber acquisition and capital expenditures, to repurchase or retire debt, to acquire other companies and to evaluate our ability to return capital to stockholders. We exclude from free cash flow certain items that do not relate to the on-going performance of our business, such as cash flows related to acquisitions, strategic and short-term investments, including tax efficient investments in clean energy as well as net loan activity with related parties and other equity investees. We believe free cash flow is an indicator of the long-term financial stability of our business. Free cash flow, which is reconciled to Net cash provided by operating activities, is a Non-GAAP financial measure. This measure can be calculated by deducting amounts under the captions Additions to property and equipment and deducting or adding Restricted and other investment activity from Net cash provided by operating activities from the consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial performance measures and may not be comparable to free cash flow measures presented by other companies. Free cash flow should be viewed as a supplemental measure rather than an alternative measure of cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow is limited and does not represent remaining cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt maturities. We believe free cash flow provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our current cash flow, along with other GAAP measures (such as cash flows from operating and investing activities), to determine our financial condition, and to compare our operating performance to other communications, entertainment and media companies. Free cash flow is calculated as follows: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cash Flow information Net cash provided by operating activities 309 444 1,062 1,301 Net cash used in investing activities (242) (188) (792) (565) Net cash used in financing activities (136) (240) (450) (771) Free Cash Flow Net cash provided by operating activities 309 444 1,062 1,301 Additions to property and equipment (216) (187) (563) (521) Sales (purchases) of other investments

 ARPU - Sirius XM ARPU is derived from total earned subscriber revenue (excluding revenue associated with our connected vehicle services) and advertising revenue, divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the daily weighted average number of subscribers for the period. 
 Subscriber acquisition cost, per installation - or SAC, per installation, is derived from subscriber acquisition costs less margins from the sale of radios and accessories (excluding connected vehicle services), divided by the number of satellite radio installations in new vehicles and shipments of aftermarket radios for the period. SAC, per installation, is calculated as follows:

Ad supported listener hours - is based on the total bytes served over our Pandora advertising supported platforms for each track that is requested and served from our Pandora servers, as measured by our internal analytics systems, whether or not a listener listens to the entire track. For non-music content such as podcasts, episodes are divided into approximately track-length parts, which are treated as tracks. To the extent that third-party measurements of advertising hours are not calculated using a similar server-based approach, the third-party measurements may differ from our measurements. 
 RPM - is calculated by dividing advertising revenue, excluding AdsWizz and other off-platform revenue, by the number of thousands of listener hours on our Pandora advertising-based service. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to our ongoing investing and financial activities and the conduct of operations. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in stock prices and interest rates. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investment activities, which include investments in fixed and floating rate debt instruments and borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other factors. We manage our exposure to interest rates by maintaining what we believe is an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We believe this best protects us from interest rate risk. We have achieved this mix by (i) issuing fixed rate debt that we believe has a low stated interest rate and significant term to maturity and (ii) issuing variable rate debt with appropriate maturities and interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had 860 million principal amount of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.4 and 9,910 million principal amount of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2 . 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer (the Executives ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Executives, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Various risk factors applicable to us and our business are described under the heading Risk Factors Factors Relating to Sirius XM Holdings in the prospectus filed with the SEC on July 23, 2024, which forms part of Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Inc. s Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-276758), which risk factors, other than the risk factor titled Sirius XM Holdings has a significant amount of indebtedness are incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business. 
 
 We may have a significant indemnity obligation to Liberty Media, which is not limited in amount or subject to any cap, if the transactions associated with the Split-Off are treated as a taxable transaction. 
 Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement that we entered into with Liberty Media in connection with the Split-Off, we are required to indemnify Liberty Media, its subsidiaries and certain related persons for taxes and losses (other than any taxes or tax-related losses that result from Section 355(e) of the Code applying to the Split-Off as a result of the Split-Off being part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of Liberty Media) resulting from the failure of the transactions associated with the Split-Off to qualify as a generally tax-free transaction under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Code to the extent that such taxes and losses (a) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by us (applicable to actions or failures to act by us and our subsidiaries following the completion of the Split-Off), (b) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the failure of certain representations made by us in support of the opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher Flom LLP regarding the generally tax-free status of the transactions associated with the Split-Off to be true and correct, or (c) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the Split-Off as a result of the treatment of the Split-Off as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50 or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in our stock (or any successor corporation), except, in the case of clauses (a) and (b), if such taxes and losses result from an action required to be taken pursuant to the agreements governing the Transactions. 
 Our indemnification obligations to Liberty Media, its subsidiaries and certain related persons are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. If we are required to indemnify Liberty Media, its subsidiaries or such related persons under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Sharing Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial position. 
 
 We may determine to forgo certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in order to avoid the risk of incurring significant tax-related liabilities. 
 Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we agreed not to take certain actions, or fail to take any action, following the Split-Off, which action or failure to act would be inconsistent with the transactions associated with the Split-Off qualifying under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Code. In particular, for the two-year period following the distribution, we are subject to specific restrictions that are intended to preserve the generally tax-free status of the Split-Off, including restrictions on our ability to discontinue the conduct of certain businesses, to merge, consolidate, liquidate, or dissolve Sirius XM Holdings or Sirius XM Inc., to redeem or repurchase our common stock, or to enter into certain other corporate transactions that may cause us to undergo either a 45 or greater change in the ownership of our voting stock or a 45 or greater change in the ownership (measured by value) of all classes of our stock, taking into account the Merger. Further, the Tax Sharing Agreement requires us to indemnify Liberty Media for any taxes or losses (subject to certain exceptions) incurred by Liberty Media (or its subsidiaries) to the extent that such taxes and losses (a) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by us (applicable to actions or failures to act by us and our subsidiaries following the completion of the Split-Off), (b) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the failure of certain representations made by us in support of the opinion of Skadden Arps regarding the generally tax-free status of the transactions associated with the Split-Off to be true and correct, or (c) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the Split-Off as a result of the treatment of the Split-Off as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50 or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in our stock (or any successor corporation). 
 Under Section 355(e) of the Code, an acquisition of our stock would generally be presumed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) with the Split-Off if such acquisition occurs within two years before or after the Split-Off (or if such stock is received in the Split-Off in exchange for Liberty SiriusXM common stock that was acquired within the two years before the Split-Off). This presumption, however, may be rebutted based upon an analysis of the facts and circumstances related to the Split-Off and the particular acquisition in question, including a weighing of certain plan and non-plan factors set forth in U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 355(e) of the Code. Further, these U.S. Treasury Regulations 
 60 

Table of Contents 

provide certain safe harbors under which an acquisition will be deemed not to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) with the Split-Off for purposes of Section 355(e) of the Code. 
 In light of the Tax Sharing Agreement and the requirements under Section 355 of the Code, including the factors and safe harbors described above, we may determine to forgo certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. In particular, we may determine to continue to operate certain of our business operations for the foreseeable future even if a sale of such business operations might otherwise be advantageous. Moreover, we might determine to forgo certain transactions, including share repurchases, stock issuances, certain asset dispositions and other strategic transactions, for some period of time following the Split-Off. In addition, our indemnity obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement might discourage, delay or prevent us entering into a change of control transaction for some period of time following the Split-Off. 
 
 We may not realize the potential benefits from the Transactions in the near term or at all. 
 We anticipate the realization of strategic and financial benefits to our stockholders as a result of our separation from Liberty Media. In determining to approve the Transactions, the Special Committee believed that the Transactions would benefit us and our businesses and result in the creation of stockholder value because, among other things, we would have a single class of one share, one vote common stock following the Transactions, we would no longer have a controlling stockholder, and the Transactions would result in more trading liquidity for our common stock and the potential for future eligibility for inclusion in stock market indexes. However, no assurance can be given as to whether or the extent to which these benefits will be actually realized. 
 
 We have assumed and are responsible for all of the liabilities attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group as a result of the completion of the Transactions, and acquired the assets of SplitCo s on an as is, where is basis. 
 Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, we acquired all of SplitCo s assets and assumed, performed, discharged and fulfilled all of the liabilities of SplitCo, as applicable, regardless of when or where such liabilities arose or arise. The Reorganization Agreement provided that the assets of SplitCo were conveyed to us on an as is, where is basis, and while Liberty Media is subject to certain indemnification obligations in favor of us under the Reorganization Agreement, these are generally limited to indemnification for certain indemnifiable losses to the extent arising out of, relating to or in connection with the businesses, assets and liabilities retained by Liberty Media (or any third party claims related thereto) or any breach or failure to perform or comply with any covenant, undertaking or obligation of Liberty Media or its subsidiaries (other than us or our subsidiaries) under the Reorganization Agreement or any agreements and instruments to which Liberty Media or SplitCo was a party required to complete the restructuring transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement. 
 Furthermore, there are no remedies available to the parties with respect to any breach of representations of the parties to the Merger Agreement, except for certain rights the party may have under applicable law to bring a claim for fraud or willful breach of the Merger Agreement. 
 As a result, we bear full responsibility for any and all assets and liabilities of SplitCo. To the extent any of the liabilities of SplitCo are larger than anticipated, or an issue with any asset of SplitCo prohibits our businesses from performing as planned, they could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We may be a target of securities class action and derivative lawsuits in connection with the Transactions. 
 Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into agreements for significant transactions such as the Transactions in an effort to seek monetary relief. We may be a defendant in one or more lawsuits relating to the Transactions, including the Merger, and, even if any such future lawsuits are without merit or resolved in our favor, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources from other potentially beneficial business opportunities. We cannot predict whether such lawsuits will be brought against us or the outcome of such lawsuits or others, nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve any such litigation. 
 
 It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders. 
 Certain provisions of our amended and restated charter and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. 
 These provisions include the following: 
 establishing a classified board of directors, with staggered terms until the third annual meeting after the effective time of the Merger, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors; 
 61 

Table of Contents 

allowing the authorized number of directors on the board of directors to be changed only by resolution of the board of directors; 
 permitting only the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board; 
 limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders; 
 prohibiting stockholder action by written consent (subject to certain exceptions), thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; 
 requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 66-2 3 in voting power of all then-outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, with respect to an amendment to our amended and restated bylaws and with respect to an amendment to particular articles of our amended and restated charter; 
 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; 
 no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect candidates to serve as a director on the board; 
 an exclusive forum provision providing that (a) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings and (b) the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for causes of action arising under federal securities law, in each case unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum; and 
 the existence of authorized and unissued stock, including blank check preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to persons friendly to our then current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us. 
 Moreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware and are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL ), pursuant to our amended and restated charter, an interested stockholder (as such term is defined in the DGCL) is prohibited from merging or combining with us, or engaging in other business combinations, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15 of the outstanding voting stock, except in certain circumstances. These provisions in our amended and restated charter and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. 
 
 We have overlapping directors with Liberty Media, which may lead to conflicting interests. 
 Mr. Maffei, President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of Liberty Media, also serves as the Chairman of our board of directors. Dr. Evan Malone, a director of Liberty Media, also serves as a member of our board of directors. The members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Liberty Media have fiduciary duties to its stockholders. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting their respective companies. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest if any conflict arises under the Tax Sharing Agreement or when we or Liberty Media looks at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Moreover, our Chairman of the board of directors and certain other directors continue to own Liberty Media common stock, restricted stock units and options to purchase Liberty Media common stock. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us or Liberty Media. Any potential conflict that could qualify as a related party transaction (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K) will be subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable company s board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Any other potential conflicts that arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each company. From time to time, Liberty Media or its respective affiliates may enter into transactions with us and/or our subsidiaries or other affiliates. Although the terms of any such transactions or agreements will be established based upon negotiations between employees of the companies involved, there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us, or our subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where the parties are completely at arms length. 
 
 Our directors and officers are protected from liability for a broad range of actions. 
 Delaware law permits limiting or eliminating the monetary liability of a director and, subject to certain limitations set forth in the DGCL, certain officers, to a corporation or its stockholders, except with regard to breaches of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, in the case of 
 62 

Table of Contents 

directors, unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock purchase or redemption, any transaction from which a director or officer derived an improper personal benefit, or, in the case of officers, any action by or in the right of the corporation. Our amended and restated charter eliminates the liability of its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. 
 
 Our holding company structure could restrict access to funds of our subsidiaries that may be needed to pay third party obligations. 
 Sirius XM Holdings is a holding company, and its assets consist primarily of its investments in its subsidiaries, including Sirius XM Inc. and Sirius XM Radio. As a holding company, our ability to meet our financial obligations (including assumed liabilities in connection with the Transactions, such as, currently, the 3.75 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028) to third parties is dependent upon our available cash balances, distributions from subsidiaries (including Sirius XM Inc. and Sirius XM Radio) and other investments and proceeds from any asset sales. Further, our ability to receive dividends or payments or advances from our subsidiaries businesses (including Sirius XM Inc. and Sirius XM Radio) depends on their individual operating results, any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they are or may become subject and the terms of their indebtedness (including the restrictive covenants contained in Sirius XM Radio s credit agreement and indentures) and any additional debt they may incur in the future. Accordingly, our ability to make payments to third parties and to otherwise meet our financial obligations at the holding company level may be constricted. 
 
 On a standalone basis and on a consolidated basis, we have significant indebtedness, and our subsidiaries debt contains certain covenants that restrict its operations. 
 On a standalone basis and on a consolidated basis, we have significant indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of approximately 10.8 billion of indebtedness outstanding. 
 Our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries: 
 increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 requires us and our subsidiaries to dedicate a portion of our and/or their cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, marketing and other general corporate activities; 
 limits our and our subsidiaries abilities to borrow additional funds; and 
 may limit our and our subsidiaries flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the audio entertainment industry. 
 In addition, Sirius XM Radio s borrowings under its Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility carry a variable interest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). Sirius XM Radio may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as swaps, caps, options, forwards, futures or other similar products. These instruments may be used to selectively manage risks, but there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against material interest rate fluctuations. 
 
 Our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund our operations could be limited, which could negatively impact its operations. 
 If additional debt financing is not available to us in the future or we are unable to access funds of our subsidiaries, we may obtain liquidity through the issuance and sale of its equity securities. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. If we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the future, we may be unable to continue to develop our business, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
