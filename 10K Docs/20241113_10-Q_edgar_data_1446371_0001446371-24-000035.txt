 of the limited partnership interests in the OP. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 10,752,966 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and 204,323 of convertible common units issued and outstanding. 
 On May 12, 2023, the board of directors unanimously approved the sale of all of the Company s assets and the dissolution of the Company pursuant to the terms of a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution of the Company (the Plan of Liquidation ). The principal purpose of the Plan of Liquidation is to maximize stockholder value by selling the Company s assets, paying its debts and distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to the Company s stockholders. On August 23, 2023 the Company s stockholders approved the Plan of Liquidation. 
 The Company expects any future liquidity to its stockholders will be provided in the form of liquidating distributions. The Company expects to distribute all of the net proceeds from liquidation to its stockholders within 24 months from August 23, 2023. The Company can give no assurance regarding the timing of final asset dispositions in connection with the implementation of the Plan of Liquidation, the sale prices it will receive for its remaining assets, and the amount or timing of any liquidating distributions to be received by its stockholders. 
 On September 12, 2024, the Company consummated the disposition of the 400 Grove Street, 8 Octavia Street, Fulton Shops, 450 Hayes, and 388 Fulton properties located in San Francisco, California for approximately 10.9 million in cash, before customary closing and transaction costs. The disposition resulted in net cash proceeds after customary closing and transaction costs of 9.8 million which was used to partially pay down the SRT Loan (as defined in Note 7). 
 As of September 30, 2024 the Company managed a portfolio of one wholly-owned income-producing retail property located in Los Angeles, California and one improved land parcel,located in Hospira, California. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s retail property had approximately rentable square feet of retail space and the rentable space at the property was leased.

 Change in net assets in liquidation Change in liquidation value of investments in real estate ) Change in estimated cash flow during liquidation Other changes, net Changes in net assets in liquidation ) 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the estimated net realizable value of real estate decreased by 2.6 million. The primary reason for the decrease in net assets in liquidation was due to a net decrease in the sale price of the properties in San Francisco which was adjusted to the actual sales price pursuant to the disposition of the properties consummated on September 12, 2024 and a decrease in the net realizable value of the remaining properties located in Los Angeles, California and Hospira, California. 
 The net assets in liquidation as of September 30, 2024 would result in the payment of estimated liquidating distributions of approximately per share of common stock to the Company s stockholders of record as of September 30, 2024. This estimate of liquidating distributions includes projections of costs and expenses to be incurred during the estimated period required to complete the Plan of Liquidation. There is inherent uncertainty with these estimates and projections, and they could change materially based on the timing of the disposition or transfer of the Company s remaining real estate properties, the performance of the Company s remaining assets and any changes in the underlying assumptions of the projected cash flows from such properties. See Note 2, Plan of Liquidation.

 As a result of adopting the liquidation basis of accounting in July 2023, as of September 30, 2024, real estate properties were recorded at their estimated liquidation value, which represents the estimated gross amount of cash or other consideration the Company expects to realize through the disposition or transfer of its real estate properties owned as of September 30, 2024 as it carries out its Plan of Liquidation.

 Disposition of San Francisco Properties 
 The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, owned five operating properties in San Francisco, California, referred to as 400 Grove Street, 8 Octavia Street, Fulton Shops, 450 Hayes, and 388 Fulton Street (collectively, the San Francisco Assets ). On August 12, 2024, the due diligence period expired under the five related purchase and sale agreements and escrow instructions for the sale of each of the San Francisco Assets. The agreements provided that the disposition of each of the San Francisco Assets was conditioned on the disposition of each other San Francisco Asset and the properties are considered related properties. 
 On September 12, 2024, the Company consummated the disposition of the San Francisco Assets for approximately 10.9 million in cash, before customary closing and transaction costs. The Purchaser was unaffiliated with the Company or its advisor. The disposition resulted in net cash proceeds after customary closing and transaction costs of 9.8 million which was used to partially repay the the SRT Loan (as defined in Note 7) and the San Francisco assets were released as security from the deed of trust. 
 
 million. The SRT Loan is a floating Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR rate loan which bears interest at (with a floor of plus . The default rate is equal to above the rate that otherwise would be in effect. Monthly payments are interest-only with the entire principal balance and all outstanding interest due at maturity. As of September 30, 2024, interest expense payable was million and default interest payable was million. Effective January 9, 2023, the Company entered into a derivative transaction with a financial institution with a notional amount of , representing an interest rate cap. The Company received a payment from the counterparty if the rate on SOFR exceeded 3.5 . The instrument is measured at fair value which was determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets and is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company paid thousand for the derivative and it matured on January 9, 2024. 
 On September 12, 2024, the Company consummated the disposition of the San Francisco Assets for approximately 10.9 million in cash, before customary closing and transaction costs. The disposition resulted in net cash proceeds after customary closing and transaction costs of 9.8 million which was used to repay the SRT Loan and the San Francisco assets were released as security from the deed of trust. The outstanding balance on the SRT Loan after the sale of the San Francisco Assets is approximately 8.2M and is secured by a deed of trust at the Silverlake Collection. 
 Pursuant to the SRT Loan, the Company must comply with certain matters contained in the loan documents including but not limited to, (i) requirements to deliver audited and unaudited financial statements, SEC filings, tax returns, pro forma budgets, and quarterly compliance certificates, and (ii) minimum limits on the Company s liquidity and tangible net worth. The SRT Loan contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, covenants with respect to maintenance of properties and insurance, compliance with laws and environmental matters, covenants limiting or prohibiting the creation of liens, and transactions with affiliates. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was not in compliance with the loan requirements and was in maturity default as discussed above. 
 In connection with the SRT Loan, the Company executed customary non-recourse carveout and environmental guaranties, together with limited additional assurances with regard to the condominium structures of the San Francisco assets.

 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning our ability to implement the Plan of Liquidation, other plans and objectives of management for future operations, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto, including with respect to a Plan of Liquidation are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These statements are only predictions. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees. Actual events or our investments and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as may, should, expect, could, intend, plan, anticipate, estimate, believe, continue, predict, potential or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. 
 The forward-looking statements included herein are based upon our current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs, which involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all of the risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
 Although our board of directors and stockholders have approved the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution (the Plan of Liquidation ), we can give no assurance whether we will be able to successfully implement the Plan of Liquidation and sell our remaining assets, pay our debts and distribute the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders in the amount or on the timeline as we expect. 
 The combination of the continued economic slowdown, higher interest rates and persistent inflation as well as a lack of lending activity in the debt markets have contributed to considerable weakness in the commercial real estate markets. These ongoing challenges continue to be one of the most significant risks and uncertainties we face in connection with the implementation of the Plan of Liquidation. 
 We can give no assurance regarding the timing of final asset dispositions and the sale prices we will receive for assets and the amount and timing of liquidating distributions to be received by our stockholders. If the sales price of our assets is less than estimated or if we underestimated our existing obligations and liabilities or if unanticipated or contingent liabilities arise, including with respect to debt service or interest expense related to the SRT Loan, the amount of liquidating distributions ultimately paid to our stockholders could be less than estimated. 
 We are currently in maturity default for failure to pay the amount of the debt outstanding and due to the lender on the January 9, 2024 maturity date for the SRT Loan that is secured by our remaining operating asset, the Silverlake Collection. Although we are in discussions with the lender to modify the loan to bring it back in good standing while we complete our liquidation activities, no assurances can be provided that we will successfully execute an agreement with the lender to extend the loan. Further, we expect that any extension of the SRT Loan would be on terms and conditions less favorable to us than previously negotiated. As a result of the default, the lender could foreclose on the Silverlake Collection which secures the loan in satisfaction of the debt. A sale of the asset by the lender may not result in maximum proceeds to us and would adversely impact the amount of our liquidating distributions as the lender is only motivated to receive a purchase price sufficient to satisfy the amount of the debt outstanding, and we believe the value of the collateral to be in excess of the amount of the debt. In addition, as a result of the default, we are required to pay an increased debt service payment due to the default interest rate in effect of 5 above the rate that would otherwise be in effect (30-day SOFR, plus 2.8 and we will be required to pay various fees to the lender in connection with securing an extension on our debt obligation. The maturity default and the related adverse impacts to us could have an adverse effect on our implementation of the Plan of Liquidation and the amount of and timing of liquidating distributions to be received by our stockholders. 
 We depend on tenants for our revenue and, accordingly, our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants. Revenues from our properties could decrease due to a reduction in tenants (caused by factors including, but not limited to, tenant defaults, tenant insolvency, early termination of tenant leases and non-renewal of existing tenant leases) and/or lower rental rates, making it more difficult for us to meet our financial obligations, including debt service and adversely affect liquidating distributions to our stockholders. Specifically, as a result of a 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 significant tenant s failure to pay rent due to us, we were unable to meet the financial covenants required to extend the term of our outstanding debt obligation and are in maturity default on the SRT Loan as described above. 
 All our assets are concentrated in California, and in particular Los Angeles, and in urban retail properties, any adverse economic, real estate or business conditions in this geographic area or in the urban retail market, including with respect to the continued economic slowdown, the higher interest rate environment and persistent inflation could adversely affect our operating results and the amount of any liquidating distributions to our stockholders. 
 Our executive officers and certain other key real estate professionals are also officers, directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor. As a result, they face conflicts of interest, including conflicts created by our advisor s compensation arrangements with us and conflicts in allocating time among us and other programs and business activities. 
 Our outstanding debt obligation has a variable interest rate with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of SOFR. Increases in SOFR would increase the amount of our debt payments. 
 All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified herein. Any of the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements included herein could be inaccurate, and undue reliance should not be placed upon on any forward-looking statements included herein. All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the risk that actual results will differ materially from the expectations expressed herein will increase with the passage of time. Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the inclusion of such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the objectives and plans set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will be achieved. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a Maryland corporation that was formed on September 18, 2008, to invest in and manage a portfolio of income-producing retail properties, located in the United States. As of September 30, 2024 our portfolio included one wholly-owned income-producing retail property, located in Los Angeles, California and one improved land parcel, located in Hospira, California. As of September 30, 2024, our retail property had approximately 11,000 rentable square feet of retail space and the rentable space at the property was 100 leased. 
 We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009, and we have operated and intend to continue to operate in such a manner. We own substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations through our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We also own a majority of the outstanding limited partner interests in the operating partnership. 
 Since our inception, our business has been managed by an external advisor. We do not have direct employees and all management and administrative personnel responsible for conducting our business are employed by our advisor. Currently we are externally managed and advised by SRT Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Advisor pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Advisor (the Advisory Agreement initially executed on August 10, 2013, and subsequently renewed every year through 2024. The current term of the Advisory Agreement terminates on August 9, 2025. As of April 2021, the Advisor is an affiliate of L3 Capital, LLC, a real estate investment firm focused on institutional quality, value-add, prime urban retail and mixed-use investment within first tier U.S. metropolitan markets. 
 Our sole purpose is to wind up our affairs and the liquidation of our assets with no objective to continue or to engage in the conduct of a trade or business, except as necessary for the orderly liquidation of our assets. 
 Plan of Liquidation 
 On May 12, 2023, our board of directors unanimously approved the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Liquidation. The principal purpose of the Plan of Liquidation is to maximize stockholder value by selling our assets, paying our debts and distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders. On August 23, 2023 our stockholders approved the Plan of Liquidation. 
 In accordance with the Plan of Liquidation, our objectives are to pursue an orderly liquidation of our company by selling all of our assets, paying our debts and our known liabilities, providing for the payment of unknown or contingent liabilities, distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders and winding up our operations and dissolving our company. For more information, see the Plan of Liquidation, which is included as an exhibit to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents 

 Our expectations about the implementation of the Plan of Liquidation and the amount of any liquidating distributions that we pay to our stockholders and when we will pay them are subject to risks and uncertainties and are based on certain estimates and assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, the actual amount of any liquidating distributions that we pay to our stockholders may be more or less than our estimate and the liquidating distributions may be paid later than we predict. There are many factors that may affect the amount of liquidating distributions we will ultimately pay to our stockholders. If we underestimated our existing obligations and liabilities or the amount of taxes, transaction fees and expenses relating to the liquidation and dissolution, or if unanticipated or contingent liabilities arise, including with respect to debt service or interest expense related to the SRT Loan, the amount of liquidating distributions ultimately paid to our stockholders could be less than estimated. Moreover, the liquidation value will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in our portfolio and the management of those assets, in response to the real estate and finance markets, based on the amount of net proceeds received from the disposition of our remaining assets and due to other factors. Accordingly, it is not possible to precisely predict the timing of any liquidating distributions we pay to our stockholders or the aggregate amount of liquidating distributions that we will ultimately pay to our stockholders. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for additional discussion of the risks associated with our implementation of the Plan of Liquidation. 
 As a result of the approval of the Plan of Liquidation by our stockholders in August 2023, we adopted the liquidation basis of accounting as of July 1, 2023, as described further in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation. 

Results of Operations 
 In light of the adoption of liquidation basis accounting as of July 1, 2023 and our liquidation pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, the results of operations for the current year period are not comparable to the prior year period. The sale of assets under the Plan of Liquidation will have a significant impact on our operations. See Overview Plan of Liquidation . 
 
 Changes in Net Assets in Liquidation 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Net assets in liquidation decreased by approximately 1.0 million from approximately 5.2 million on December 31, 2023 to approximately 4.2 million on September 30, 2024. The primary reason for the decrease in net assets in liquidation was due to a net decrease in the sale price of the properties in San Francisco and Los Angeles. There is inherent uncertainty with these estimates and projections, and they could change materially based on the timing of the sales of our remaining real estate properties, the performance of our remaining assets and any changes in the underlying assumptions of the projected cash flows from such properties. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As described above under Overview Plan of Liquidation, our board of directors and our stockholders have approved the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Liquidation. We expect to sell all of our assets, pay all of our known liabilities, provide for unknown liabilities and distribute the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders. We expect our principal demands for funds during the short and long-term are and will be for the payment of operating expenses, interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, general and administrative expenses, including expenses in connection with the Plan of Liquidation, and payments of distributions to stockholders pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation. We expect to use our cash on hand and net sales proceeds from the sale of our assets as our primary source of liquidity. To the extent available, we also intend to use cash flow generated by our real estate investments; however, tenant lease terminations and asset sales will further reduce cash flow from these sources. 
 Our investments in real estate generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues and tenant reimbursements, which are reduced by operating expenditures, capital expenditures, debt service payments, the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations from real estate investments is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates on our leases, the collectability of rent and operating recoveries from our tenants and how well we manage our expenditures, all of which may be adversely affected by the general market conditions impacting commercial real estate and our tenants as discussed above. In particular, a significant tenant to the portfolio stopped paying rent under its lease, which has adversely affected our cash flow from operations. While we intend to pursue all remedies available to us with respect to collecting amounts outstanding and owed to us under the lease, we can provide no assurances that we will be successful in recovering amounts owed or securing a new tenant. If we are unable to address the reduced rental revenue caused by these events, our access to capital and ability to fund our liquidity needs will be adversely affected due to our decreased cash from operations and potential inability to satisfy financial covenants established by lenders.

 Due to our decreased cash flow from operations, caused in significant part by our significant tenant s failure to pay rent owed to us, we did not satisfy the financial covenants necessary to exercise our one-year extension option for the SRT Loan on its January 9, 2024 maturity date, and we are in maturity default with respect to the loan for failure to pay the amount outstanding and due. As a result of the default the lender initiated a cash sweep, and as a result, all rental payments are being directed to the sweep account and the lender controls disbursements to cover certain operating expenditures at the properties. In addition, we are incurring increased debt service due to the default interest rate in effect of 5 above the rate that would otherwise be in effect (30-day SOFR, plus 2.8 ). Both of these events are adversely impacting our ability to fund our short-term liquidity needs. We are actively marketing our assets for sale to satisfy the outstanding debt; however, we can provide no assurances we will be successful. 
 In addition, the SRT Loan is secured by our retail property in Los Angeles and as a result of the default, the lender could foreclose on our operating property which secure the loan in satisfaction of the debt. Should the lender foreclose on the property, a sale of our asset by the lender may not result in maximum proceeds to us and would adversely impact the amount of our liquidating distributions as the lender is only motivated to receive a purchase price sufficient to satisfy the amount of the debt outstanding, and we believe the value of the collateral to be in excess of the amount of the debt. The maturity default and the related adverse impacts to us could have an adverse effect on our liquidity as well s the implementation of the Plan of Liquidation and the amount of and timing of liquidating distributions to be received by our stockholders. 
 On September 12, 2024, we consummated the disposition of the 400 Grove Street, 8 Octavia Street, Fulton Shops, 450 Hayes, and 388 Fulton properties located in San Francisco, California for approximately 10.9 million in cash, before customary closing and transaction costs. The disposition resulted in net cash proceeds after customary closing and transaction costs of 9.8 million which was used to partially pay down the SRT Loan. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately 0.3 million and we had 1.8 million of restricted cash (funds held by the lenders for property taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, capital expenditures, rollover reserves and other financing needs). 
 We have limited cash on hand due to the cash sweep initiated by the lender of the SRT Loan. In addition, our debt service costs have increased due to the default interest rate associated with the maturity default. As a result, our ability to fund our working capital needs through the completion of the Plan of Liquidation is severely limited. Further, our ability to make a loan paydown and continue funding our liquidity needs is contingent on the sale of our remaining real estate asset. The property securing the SRT Loan is being marketed for sale in connection with the implementation of the Plan of Liquidation and any net sales proceeds would be due to the lender until the debt is satisfied with the balance being available to fund certain of our expenses. As discussed, the lender on the SRT Loan could take control of our property pursuant to foreclosure proceedings as a result of the maturity default on the SRT Loan. Such an event would materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs. 
 In addition, the fixed costs associated with managing a public REIT, including the significant cost of corporate compliance with all federal, state and local regulatory requirements applicable to us with respect to our business activities, are substantial. Such costs include, without limitation, the cost of preparing or causing to be prepared all financial statements required under applicable regulations and contractual undertakings and all reports, documents and filings required under the Exchange Act, or other federal or state laws for the general maintenance of our status as a REIT, under the applicable provisions of the Code, or otherwise. Given the size of our portfolio of properties, these costs constitute a significant percentage of our gross income, reducing our cash flow. Moreover, if we are unsuccessful in implementing the Plan of Liquidation and disposing of our assets, we will have to address a liquidity deficiency as our cash flow is not sufficient to cover our current operating expenses over the long term. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of uncertainties, including with respect to the current economic environment and there can be no guarantee that we will be successful with our plan. 
 
 Recent Financing Transactions 
 Multi-Property Secured Financing 
 On December 24, 2019, we entered into a loan agreement (the SRT Loan Agreement with PFP Holding Company, LLC (the SRT Lender for a non-recourse secured loan (the SRT Loan ). 
 The SRT Loan is secured by a first deed of trust on our Silverlake Collection asset located in Los Angeles. Prior to its disposition on September 12, 2024, our five San Francisco assets (Fulton Shops, 8 Octavia, 400 Grove, 450 Hayes, and 388 Fulton Street) also secured the SRT Loan. The SRT Loan matured on January 9, 2024, without extension pursuant to its terms as a result of the Company s failure to satisfy the necessary financial covenants for a one-year extension.. 
 We are currently in maturity default for failure to pay the amount of the debt outstanding and due to the SRT Lender on the January 9, 2024 maturity date. Although we are in discussions with the SRT Lender to extend the term of the SRT Loan while 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 we complete our liquidation activities, no assurances can be provided that we will successfully extend the term of the SRT Loan. As a result of the default, the lender is sweeping the cash from the property securing the loan and we are required to pay an increased debt service payment due to the default interest rate in effect of 5 above the rate that would otherwise be in effect (30-day SOFR, plus 2.8 and will be required to pay various fees to the lender in connection with securing an extension on our debt obligation. In addition, the SRT Lender could foreclose on the Silverlake Collection asset that secures the loan in satisfaction of the debt. Such an event could have an adverse effect on our implementation of the Plan of Liquidation and the amount of and timing of liquidating distributions to be received by our stockholders. 
 The Silverlake Collection is being marketed for sale in connection with the implementation of the Plan of Liquidation and any net sales proceeds would be due to the lender until the debt is satisfied. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the SRT Loan had a principal balance of approximately 8.2 million. The SRT Loan is a floating Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR rate loan which bears interest at 30-day SOFR (with a floor of 1.50 plus 2.80 . Monthly payments were interest-only with the entire principal balance and all outstanding interest due at maturity. As of September 30, 2024, interest expense payable was 1.1 million and default interest payable was 0.7 million. 
 On September 12, 2024, the Company consummated the disposition of five San Francisco assets for approximately 10.9 million in cash, before customary closing and transaction costs. The disposition resulted in net cash proceeds after customary closing and transaction costs of 9.8 million which was used to partially repay the SRT Loan and the San Francisco assets were released as security from the deed of trust. The outstanding balance on the SRT Loan after the sale of the San Francisco Assets is approximately 8.1M and is secured by a deed of trust at the Silverlake Collection. 
 Pursuant to the SRT Loan, we were required to comply with certain matters contained in the loan documents including but not limited to, (i) requirements to deliver audited and unaudited financial statements, SEC filings, tax returns, pro forma budgets, and quarterly compliance certificates, and (ii) minimum limits on our liquidity and tangible net worth. The SRT Loan contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, covenants with respect to maintenance of properties and insurance, compliance with laws and environmental matters, covenants limiting or prohibiting the creation of liens, and transactions with affiliates. As of September 30, 2024, we were not in compliance with the loan requirements and were in maturity default as discussed above. 
 In connection with the SRT Loan, we executed customary non-recourse carveout and environmental guaranties, together with limited additional assurances with regard to the condominium structures of the San Francisco assets. 
 
 Guidelines on Total Operating Expenses 
 We reimburse our Advisor for some expenses paid or incurred by our Advisor in connection with the services provided to us, except that we will not reimburse our Advisor for any amount by which our total operating expenses at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceed the greater of (1) 2 of our average invested assets, as defined in our charter; and (2) 25 of our net income, as defined in our charter, or the 2 /25 Guidelines unless a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. 
 
 Inflation 
 The majority of our leases contain inflation protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for common area maintenance charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per square foot allowance. We expect to include similar provisions in our future tenant leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases, as well as rents received from acquired leases, may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market rates. 
 
 REIT Compliance 
 To qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to annually distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which our REIT qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 
 Quarterly Distributions 
 In accordance with the Plan of Liquidation, our objectives are to pursue an orderly liquidation of our company by selling or otherwise disposing of our remaining assets, paying or otherwise settling our debts and our known liabilities, providing for the 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 payment of unknown or contingent liabilities, distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders and winding up our operations and dissolving our company. We may pay multiple, or a single, liquidating distribution(s) to our stockholders during the liquidation process. We will pay the final liquidating distribution after we sell all of our assets, pay or provide for all of our known liabilities and provide for unknown liabilities. We expect to complete these activities within 24 months of August 23, 2023, the day we received stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation. A final liquidating distribution to our stockholders may not be paid until all of our liabilities have been satisfied. 
 Our expectations about the amount of liquidating distributions that we will pay and when we will pay them are based on many estimates and assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, the actual amount of liquidating distributions we pay to our stockholders may be more or less than we estimate and the liquidating distributions may be paid later than we predict. We do not expect to pay regular monthly distributions during the liquidation process. We intend to maintain adequate cash reserves for liquidity, debt repayments and other future capital needs. 
 
 Related Party Transactions and Agreements 
 We are currently party to the Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which the Advisor manages our business in exchange for specified fees paid for services related to the investment of funds in real estate and real estate-related investments, management of our investments and for other services. Refer to Note 11. Related Party Transactions to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Advisory Agreement and other related party transactions, agreements and fees. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management believes are or will be critical during our liquidation. We consider these policies critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. 
 Subsequent to the adoption of the liquidation basis of accounting, we are required to estimate all costs and income we expect to incur and earn through the end of liquidation including the estimated amount of cash we expect to collect through the disposal of our assets and the estimated costs to dispose of our assets. 
 Pursuant to our stockholders approval of the Plan of Liquidation, we adopted the liquidation basis of accounting as of and for the periods subsequent to July 1, 2023 (as approval of the Plan of Liquidation became imminent during the month of July 2023 based on the results of our solicitation of proxies from our stockholders for their approval of the Plan of Liquidation). Accordingly, on July 1, 2023, assets were adjusted to their estimated net realizable value, or liquidation value, which represents the estimated amount of cash or other consideration that we expect to receive through the disposal of our assets as we carry out our Plan of Liquidation. The liquidation values of our remaining real estate properties are presented on a net realizable value basis. Liabilities are carried at their contractual amounts due or estimated settlement amounts. 
 We accrue costs and income that we expect to incur and earn through the completion of our liquidation, including the estimated amount of cash or other consideration that we expect to receive through the disposal of our assets and the estimated costs to dispose of our assets, to the extent we have a reasonable basis for estimation. These amounts are classified as a liability for estimated costs in excess of estimated receipts during liquidation on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Net Assets. Actual costs and income may differ from amounts reflected in the financial statements because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future events. These differences may be material. See Note 2, Plan of Liquidation and Note 4, Liabilities for Estimated Costs in Excess of Estimated Receipts During Liquidation for further discussion. Actual costs incurred but unpaid as of September 30, 2024, are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses, due to affiliate and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Net Assets. 
 Real Estate - Liquidation Basis of Accounting 
 As of July 1, 2023, our investments in real estate were adjusted to their estimated net realizable value, or liquidation value, to reflect the change to the liquidation basis of accounting. The liquidation value represents the estimated amount of cash or other consideration we expect to realize through the disposal our assets, including any residual value attributable to lease intangibles, as we carries out the Plan of Liquidation. The liquidation value of investments in real estate for the operating properties was based on offers we received for the sale of the properties, which we are marketing for sale. The liquidation values of our investments in real estate are presented on an undiscounted basis and investments in real estate are no longer depreciated. Subsequent to July 1, 2023, all changes in the estimated liquidation value of the investments in real estate are reflected as a change to our net assets in liquidation. 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 Below is a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates. While management determined these to be not critical, they are still considered to be significant and relevant for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. 
 Rents and Other Receivables 
 In accordance with the liquidation basis of accounting, as of July 1, 2023, rents and other receivables were adjusted to their net realizable value. We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants. Any changes in the collectibility of the receivables are reflected as a change to our net assets in liquidation. 
 Revenue Recognition - Liquidation Basis of Accounting 
 Under the liquidation basis of accounting, we accrued all income that we expect to earn through the completion of our liquidation to the extent we have a reasonable basis for estimation. Revenue from tenants is estimated based on the contractual in-place leases and projected leases through the anticipated disposition date of the property. These amounts are presented net of estimated expenses and other liquidation costs and are classified in liabilities for estimated costs in excess of estimated receipts during liquidation on the Consolidated Statement of Net Assets. 
 We own certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant s sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets. Contingent rental income is not contemplated under liquidation accounting unless there is a reasonable basis to estimate future receipts. 
 Accrued Liquidation Costs 
 In accordance with the liquidation basis of accounting, we accrue for certain estimated liquidation costs to the extent we have a reasonable basis for estimation. These consist of legal fees, dissolution costs, final audit/tax costs, insurance, and transfer agent related costs. 
 
 Subsequent Events 
 On November 13, 2024, the Company consummated the disposition of Topaz for 220 thousand in cash, before customary closing and transaction costs of 42 thousand, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately 178 thousand.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon, and as of the date of, the evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 During the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we did not issue any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 Share Redemption Program 
 Our board of directors adopted a share redemption program that could enable our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock to us in limited circumstances (the SRP ), subject to the significant restrictions and limitations of the program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not redeem shares. As a result of the approval by our board of directors and our stockholders of the Plan of Liquidation, we do not expect to redeem any shares under the SRP going forward and expect that any future liquidity provided to stockholders will be in the form of liquidating distributions. We can provide no assurances as to the timing, amount, or successful implementation of the Plan of Liquidation. 
 
 ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES

 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 On November 7, 2024, our board of directors approved an updated estimated liquidation value per share of our common stock of 0.38, which is equal to our net assets in liquidation, divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2024, and as disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the November 2024 Estimated Liquidation Value Per Share ). 
 We adopted the liquidation basis of accounting as of and for the periods subsequent to July 1, 2023. Net assets in liquidation represents the remaining estimated liquidation value available to stockholders upon liquidation. For a description of our accounting policies and the methodologies, limitations and assumptions used in the determination of the November 2024 Estimated Liquidation Value Per Share, see the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We are providing the November 2024 Estimated Liquidation Value Per Share to assist broker-dealers that participated in our now-terminated initial public offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Rule 2231. 
 The November 2024 Estimated Liquidation Value Per Share will first appear on the December 2024 stockholder account statements. 
 Limitations of the November 2024 Estimated Liquidation Value Per Share 
 As with any valuation methodology, the methodologies used are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated liquidation value per share, and this difference could be significant. The November 2024 Estimated Liquidation Value Per Share does not represent the fair value of our assets less the fair value of our liabilities according to GAAP. Moreover, we did not obtain appraisals in connection with the determination of the November 2024 Estimated Liquidation Value Per Share, and the determination was based solely on the net assets in liquidation as reported in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our expectations about the implementation of the Plan of Liquidation and the amount of any liquidating distributions that we pay to our stockholders and when we will pay them are subject to risks and uncertainties and are based on certain estimates and assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, the actual amount of any liquidating distributions that we pay to our stockholders may be more or less than our estimate and the liquidating distributions may be paid later than we predict. There are many factors that may affect the amount of liquidating distributions we will ultimately pay to our stockholders. If we underestimated our existing obligations and liabilities or the amount of taxes, transaction fees and expenses 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 relating to the liquidation and dissolution, or if unanticipated or contingent liabilities arise, including with respect to debt service or interest expense related to the SRT Loan, the amount of liquidating distributions ultimately paid to our stockholders could be less than estimated. Moreover, the liquidation value will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in our portfolio and the management of those assets, in response to the real estate and finance markets, based on the amount of net proceeds received from the disposition of our remaining assets and due to other factors. Accordingly, it is not possible to precisely predict the timing of any liquidating distributions we pay to our stockholders or the aggregate amount of liquidating distributions that we will ultimately pay to our stockholders. 
 No assurance can be given that any liquidating distributions we pay to our stockholders will equal or exceed the November 2024 Estimated Liquidation Value Per Share. Accordingly, with respect to the November 2024 Estimated Liquidation Value Per Share, we can give no assurance: 
 of the amount or timing of liquidating distributions we will ultimately be able to pay our stockholders; 
 that a stockholder would be able to resell his or her shares at the November 2024 Estimated Liquidation Value Per Share; 
 that an independent third-party appraiser or third-party valuation firm would agree with the November 2024 Estimated Liquidation Value Per Share; or 
 that the methodology used to determine the November 2024 Estimated Liquidation Value Per Share would be acceptable to FINRA or for compliance with ERISA reporting requirements.

Dear Doug: This letter is written with respect to the proposed acquisition of the Property by SM1848, LLC, a California limited liability company Buyer ), from SRT SF RETAIL I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Seller ). Toward that end, Seller and Buyer contemplate that each Condo may be conveyed pursuant to a separate and distinct Agreement of Purchase and Sale and Joint Escrow Instructions (each a PSA and, collectively, the PSAs ). All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meaning ascribed to such term in the PSAs. However, such separate and distinct PSAs shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this letter, which, if mutually executed and delivered by Buyer and Seller, shall constitute an agreement (if applicable, this Letter Agreement ). Such Letter Agreement constitutes a material consideration to Seller for entering into separate and distinct PSAs with respect to the Property. To the extent of any conflict between the PSAs and the Letter Agreement, the Letter Agreement shall control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Letter Agreement or the PSAs, Buyer shall be obligated to perform under all of the PSAs and shall have no right to acquire some but not all of the Condos. Seller s performance under each PSA is expressly conditioned and contingent upon Buyer performing its obligations under each and every other PSA. Further, (i) if Buyer is entitled to and does so elect to terminate any PSA (including, without limitation, for default or failure of contingency or otherwise), such election shall be deemed Buyer s election to terminate all of the PSAs, and (ii) if Seller is entitled to and does so elect to terminate any PSA, such election shall be deemed Seller s election to terminate all of the PSAs (including, without limitation, for default or failure of contingency or otherwise).

Such credit amount shall be indicated as a reimbursement of transaction costs or similar on the settlement statement(s) at the Close of Escrow. Seller and Buyer will keep confidential the terms of this Letter Agreement; provided, however, Seller and Buyer may disclose the terms of this Letter Agreement to (a) those employed by them (subject to the disclosing party informing such employees of the terms of this paragraph); (b) those who are actively and directly participating in the evaluation of the Property and the negotiation and execution of the PSAs or financing of the purchase of the Property (subject to the disclosing party informing such recipients of the terms of this paragraph); (c) third parties as required under applicable law; and (d) Buyer's potential financial partners and lenders (subject to the disclosing party informing such parties of the terms of this paragraph). If these terms meet with your approval, please indicate Buyer s agreement in the appropriate place below. This Letter Agreement shall not be deemed to require Seller or Buyer to enter into the PSAs or any PSA; if PSAs are not executed and delivered by Seller and Buyer with respect to the entirety of the Property within five (5) business days of the mutual execution and delivery of this Letter Agreement, this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect whatsoever.
