Devon has an interest in Catalyst, which is a joint venture with an affiliate of Howard Energy Partners, LLC HEP and certain other investors, to develop oil gathering and natural gas processing infrastructure in the Stateline area of the Delaware Basin. Under the terms of the arrangement, Devon and a holding company owned by the other joint venture investors each have a voting interest in the joint venture legal entity, and HEP serves as the operator. Through 2038, Devon s production from net acres in the Stateline area of the Delaware Basin has been dedicated to Catalyst subject to fixed-fee oil gathering and natural gas processing agreements. Devon accounts for the investment in Catalyst as an equity method investment. Devon's investment in Catalyst is shown within investments on the consolidated balance sheets and Devon's share of Catalyst earnings are reflected as a component of other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings. In the second quarter of 2023, Devon made an investment in the Water JV, a joint venture entity formed with an affiliate of WaterBridge NDB LLC WaterBridge ), for the purpose of providing increased capacity and flexibility in disposing of produced water in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford. Under terms of the arrangement, Devon contributed water infrastructure assets and committed to a water gathering and disposal dedication to the Water JV through 2038, in exchange for a voting interest in the joint venture legal entity. WaterBridge contributed water infrastructure assets to the Water JV, in exchange for a voting interest in the joint venture legal entity and will serve as the operator. In the second quarter of 2023, Devon recognized a million gain in asset dispositions in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings, which represented the excess of the estimated fair value of Devon's interest in the Water JV over the carrying value of the water infrastructure assets Devon contributed to the Water JV.

Contingent Earnout Payments Devon is entitled to contingent earnout payments associated with the sale of its Barnett Shale assets in 2020 with upside participation beginning at a Henry Hub natural gas price or a WTI oil price. Devon received million in contingent earnout payments related to this transaction in the first quarter of 2024 and million in the first quarter of 2023. Devon could also receive up to an additional million in contingent earnout payments for the remaining performance period depending on future commodity prices.

Credit Lines In 2023, Devon amended and restated its 2018 Senior Credit Facility to provide for a new billion revolving 2023 Senior Credit Facility. Devon has the option to extend the March 24, 2029 maturity date by two additional one-year periods subject to lender consent. As of September 30, 2024, Devon had outstanding borrowings under the 2023 Senior Credit Facility and had issued million in outstanding letters of credit under this facility. The 2023 Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires Devon's ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, to be no greater than . Under the terms of the credit agreement, total capitalization is adjusted to add back non-cash financial write-downs such as impairments. As of September 30, 2024, Devon was in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of Term Loan Credit Agreement On August 12, 2024, Devon entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the Term Loan Credit Agreement ), providing for delayed draw term loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed billion, including a 364-day tranche of million and a two-year tranche of billion. On September 27, 2024, Devon borrowed billion on the two-year tranche (the Term Loan to partially fund the closing of the Grayson Mill acquisition. In connection with the borrowing of the Term Loan, the undrawn commitments under the Term Loan Credit Agreement automatically terminated. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate based on term SOFR plus a spread adjustment that varies based on Devon's credit ratings. The interest rate on the Term Loan was as of September 30, 2024. The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains substantially the same financial covenant as the 2023 Senior Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, Devon was in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of . Issuance of Senior Notes On August 28, 2024, Devon issued billion of senior notes due 2034 and billion of senior notes due 2054. Devon used the net proceeds to partially fund the Grayson Mill acquisition. For additional information, see Note 2 .

Contingent earnout payments 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values in the table above. Level 1 Fair Value Measurements Cash equivalents Amounts consist primarily of money market investments and the fair value approximates the carrying value. Level 2 Fair Value Measurements Commodity derivatives The fair value of commodity derivatives is estimated using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward curves and data obtained from independent third parties for contracts with similar terms or data obtained from counterparties to the agreements. Debt Devon s debt instruments do not consistently trade actively in an established market. The fair values of its debt are estimated based on rates available for debt with similar terms and maturity when active trading is not available. Our variable rate debt is non-public and consists of our Term Loan. The fair value of our variable rate debt approximates the carrying value as the underlying SOFR resets every month based on the prevailing market rate. Level 3 Fair Value Measurements Contingent Earnout Payments Devon has the right to receive contingent consideration related to the Barnett asset divestiture based on future oil and gas prices. These values were derived using a Monte Carlo valuation model and qualify as a level 3 fair value measurement. For additional information, see Note 2 .

Item 2 . Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis addresses material changes in our results of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to previous periods, and in our financial condition and liquidity since December 31, 2023. For information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Executive Over view 
 
 We are a leading independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company whose operations are focused onshore in the United States. Our operations are currently focused in five core areas: the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Anadarko Basin, Williston Basin and Powder River Basin. Our asset base is underpinned by premium acreage in the economic core of the Delaware Basin and our diverse, top-tier resource plays, providing a deep inventory of opportunities for years to come. 
 
 On September 27, 2024, we acquired the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill for total consideration of approximately 5.0 billion, consisting of 3.5 billion of cash and approximately 37.3 million shares of Devon common stock, including purchase price adjustments. The transaction is expected to increase our volumes in 2025 by approximately 100 MBoe/d. The acquisition will allow us to efficiently expand our oil production and operating scale, creating immediate and long-term, sustainable value to shareholders over time. 
 
 As evidenced by this acquisition, we remain focused on building economic value by executing on our strategic priorities of moderating production growth, emphasizing capital and operational efficiencies, optimizing reinvestment rates to maximize free cash flow, maintaining low leverage, delivering cash returns to our shareholders and pursuing ESG excellence. Our recent performance highlights for these priorities include the following items for the third quarter of 2024: 
 
 Oil production totaled 335 MBbls/d, exceeding our plan by 4 . 

As of September 30, 2024, completed approximately 60 of our authorized 5.0 billion share repurchase program with approximately 61.3 million of our common shares purchased for approximately 3.0 billion, or 49.62 per share since inception of the plan. 

Exited with 3.7 billion of liquidity, including 0.7 billion of cash. 

Generated 1.7 billion of operating cash flow and 6.7 billion for the past twelve trailing months. 

Including variable dividends, paid dividends of 272 million and have declared approximately 144 million of dividends to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Earnings attributable to Devon were 812 million, or 1.30 per diluted share. 

Core earnings (Non-GAAP) were 683 million, or 1.10 per diluted share. 

We remain committed to capital discipline and delivering the objectives that underpin our current plan. Those objectives prioritize value creation through moderated capital investment and production growth, particularly with a view of the volatility in commodity prices, supply chain constraints and the economic uncertainty arising from inflation and geopolitical events. Our cash-return objectives remain focused on opportunistic share repurchases, funding our dividends, repaying debt at upcoming maturities and building cash balances.

From the second quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2024, the change in volumes contributed to a 51 million increase in earnings. The increase in volumes was primarily due to new well activity in the Delaware Basin, which was partially offset by natural well declines in the Eagle Ford and Anadarko Basin. We expect volumes to increase approximately 110 MBoe/d in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to the Grayson Mill acquisition.

From the second quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2024, realized prices contributed to a 182 million decrease in earnings. Unhedged oil and NGL prices decreased primarily due to lower WTI and Mont Belvieu index prices, respectively. Unhedged gas prices decreased primarily due to the expanded regional gas price differential in the Delaware Basin driven by infrastructure constraints. The decrease in unhedged prices was partially offset by hedge cash settlements across all commodities. 
 
 We currently have approximately 35 and 20 of our remaining anticipated 2024 oil and gas production hedged, respectively. For 2025, we currently have hedged approximately 10 and 20 of our anticipated oil and gas production, respectively.

From the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in volumes contributed to a 367 million increase in earnings. Volumes increased primarily due to new well activity in the Delaware Basin, Williston Basin and Eagle Ford, which was partially offset by natural well declines in the Anadarko Basin. We expect volumes to increase approximately 110 MBoe/d in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to the Grayson Mill acquisition.

From the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, realized prices contributed to a 331 million decrease in earnings. This decrease was due to lower unhedged realized gas and NGL prices which decreased primarily due to lower Henry Hub and Mont Belvieu index prices. Additionally, gas prices were impacted by expanded regional gas price differentials in the Delaware Basin driven by infrastructure constraints. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in unhedged realized oil prices which was primarily due to slightly higher WTI index prices. Realized prices were strengthened by hedge cash settlements across all commodities.

Capital expenditures consist primarily of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations, midstream operations and other corporate activities. Our capital investment program is driven by a disciplined allocation process focused on moderating our production growth and maximizing our returns. As such, our capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2024 represented approximately 55 of our operating cash flow. 
 Acquisitions of Property and Equipment 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we acquired the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill. The transaction consisted of 3.5 billion of cash and approximately 37.3 million shares of Devon common stock. For additional information, please see Note 2 in Part I. Financial Information Item 1. Financial Statements in this report. 
 Divestitures of Property and Equipment 
 During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we received contingent earnout payments related to assets previously sold. For additional information, please see Note 2 in Part I. Financial Information Item 1. Financial Statements in this report. 
 Investment Activity 
 During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, Devon received distributions from our investments of 35 million and 24 million, respectively. Devon contributed 78 million and 52 million to our investments during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Debt Activity 
 In the third quarter of 2024, Devon issued 1.25 billion of 5.20 senior notes due 2034 and 1.0 billion of 5.75 senior notes due 2054. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2024, Devon borrowed 1.0 billion on the Term Loan. These debt issuances helped fund the Grayson Mill acquisition. In the third quarter of 2024, Devon retired 472 million of debt. For additional information, see Note 11 in "Part I. Financial Information - Item 1. Financial Statements" in this report. 
 Shareholder Distributions and Stock Activity 
 We repurchased approximately 16.3 million shares of common stock for 744 million and approximately 13.9 million shares of common stock for 745 million under the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. For additional information, see Note 14 in Part I. Financial Information Item 1. Financial Statements in this report. 
 The following table summarizes our common stock dividends during the third quarter and total for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. Devon has raised its fixed dividend multiple times over the past two calendar years and most recently raised it by 10 from 0.20 to 0.22 per share in the first quarter of 2024. In addition to the fixed quarterly dividend, we paid a variable dividend in the first, second and third quarters of 2024 and 2023.

Noncontrolling Interest Activity, net 
 During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we distributed 36 million and 33 million, respectively, to our noncontrolling interests in CDM. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we received 44 million and 18 million, respectively, in contributions from our noncontrolling interests. 
 Liquidity 
 The business of exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive. Because oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are a depleting resource, we, like all upstream operators, must continually make capital investments to grow and even sustain production. Generally, our capital investments are focused on drilling and completing new wells and maintaining production from existing wells. At opportunistic times, we also acquire operations and properties from other operators or landowners to enhance our existing portfolio of assets. 
 On September 27, 2024, Devon acquired the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill. This acquisition adds a high-margin production mix that enhances our position and efficiently expands our operating scale and production. The acquisition delivers sustainable accretion to earnings and free cash flow further supporting our cash-return business model, which moderates growth, emphasizes capital efficiencies and prioritizes cash returns to shareholders. 
 Historically, our primary sources of capital funding and liquidity have been our operating cash flow, cash on hand and asset divestiture proceeds. Additionally, we maintain a commercial paper program, supported by our revolving line of credit, which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances. If needed, we can also issue debt and equity securities, including through transactions under our shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. We estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our planned capital requirements as discussed in this section as well as return cash to shareholders. 
 Operating Cash Flow 
 Key inputs into determining our planned capital investment are the amount of cash we hold and operating cash flow we expect to generate over the next one to three or more years. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, we held approximately 700 million of cash. Our operating cash flow forecasts are sensitive to many variables and include a measure of uncertainty as actual results may differ from our expectations. 
 Commodity Prices The most uncertain and volatile variables for our operating cash flow are the prices of the oil, gas and NGLs we produce and sell. Prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other highly variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors, which are difficult to predict, create volatility in prices and are beyond our control. 
 To mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk. The key terms to our oil, gas and NGL derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 are presented in Note 3 in Part I. Financial Information Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 
 Further, when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position, we expect to achieve our capital investment priorities. Additionally, we remain committed to capital discipline and focused on delivering the objectives that underpin our capital plan for 2024. The currently elevated level of cost inflation has eroded, and could continue to erode, our cost efficiencies gained over previous years and pressure our margins for the foreseeable future. Despite this, we expect to continue generating material amounts of free cash flow at current commodity price levels due to our strategy of spending within cash flow. 
 Operating Expenses Commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses. Significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities. As a result, the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and materials may also decrease, causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline. However, the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices. We expect to mitigate the impact of cost inflation through efficiencies gained from the scale of our operations as well as by leveraging our long-standing relationships with our suppliers. 
 Credit Losses Our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways. This includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil, gas and NGL production, the collection of receivables from our joint interest owners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts. We utilize a 
 36 

Table of Contents 

variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers, joint interest owners and counterparties. Such mechanisms include, under certain conditions, requiring letters of credit, prepayments or cash collateral postings. 
 Credit Availability 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 3.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under our 2023 Senior Credit Facility. This credit facility supports our 3.0 billion of short-term credit under our commercial paper program. At September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program, and we were in compliance with the Senior Credit Facility s financial covenant. 
 Debt Ratings 
 We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the U.S. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales and the size and scale of our production. Our credit rating from Standard and Poor s Financial Services is BBB with a stable outlook. Our credit rating from Fitch is BBB+ with a stable outlook. Our credit rating from Moody s Investor Service is Baa2 with a stable outlook. Any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements. 
 There are no rating triggers in any of our contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level. However, a downgrade could adversely impact our interest rate on our Term Loan or any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future. 
 Cash Returns to Shareholders 
 
 We are committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our Board of Directors will consider a number of factors when setting the quarterly dividend, if any, including a general target of paying out approximately 10 of operating cash flow through the fixed dividend. In addition to the fixed quarterly dividend, we may pay a variable dividend or complete share repurchases. Each quarter s free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed as operating cash flow (a GAAP measure) before balance sheet changes less capital expenditures. The declaration and payment of any future dividend, whether fixed or variable, will remain at the full discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. 
 
 In November 2024, Devon announced a fixed cash dividend in the amount of 0.22 per share for approximately 144 million payable in the fourth quarter of 2024. Devon has elected not to declare a variable dividend to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Our Board of Directors has authorized a 5.0 billion share repurchase program that expires June 30, 2026. Through October 2024, we had executed 3.1 billion of the authorized program. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Our capital expenditures budget for the remainder of 2024 is expected to be approximately 950 million, including 150 million of incremental capital expenditures related to the Grayson Mill acquisition. 
 
 Critical Accounting Est imates 
 Purchase Accounting 
 Periodically we acquire assets and assume liabilities in transactions accounted for as business combinations, such as the acquisition of the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill. In connection with the acquisition, we allocated the 5.0 billion of purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The preliminary purchase price assessment remains an ongoing process and is subject to change for up to one year subsequent to the closing date of the acquisition. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

We made a number of assumptions in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values of proved and unproved oil and gas properties. Since sufficient market data was not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, we prepared estimates and engaged third-party valuation experts. Significant judgments and assumptions are inherent in these estimates and include, among other things, estimates of reserve quantities, estimates of future commodity prices, drilling plans, expected development costs, lease operating costs, reserve risk adjustment factors and an estimate of an applicable market participant discount rate that reflects the risk of the underlying cash flow estimates. 
 Estimated fair values ascribed to assets acquired can have a significant impact on future results of operations presented in Devon s financial statements. A higher fair value ascribed to a property results in higher DD A expense, which results in lower net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserve quantities, development costs and operating costs. In the event that future commodity prices or reserve quantities are lower than those used as inputs to determine estimates of acquisition date fair values, the likelihood increases that certain costs may be determined to not be recoverable. 
 For additional information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 
 
 Non-GA AP Measures 
 We utilize core earnings attributable to Devon and core earnings per share attributable to Devon that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not alternatives to GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under GAAP. Core earnings attributable to Devon, as well as the per share amount, represent net earnings excluding certain non-cash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results. Our non-GAAP measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure. Amounts excluded relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments (including unproved asset impairments), deferred tax asset valuation allowance, fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and restructuring and transaction costs. 
 We believe these non-GAAP measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts. We also believe these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers. 
 
 Below are reconciliations of core earnings and core earnings per share attributable to Devon to comparable GAAP measures.

EBITDAX and Field-Level Cash Margin 
 To assess the performance of our assets, we use EBITDAX and Field-Level Cash Margin. We compute EBITDAX as net earnings before income tax expense; financing costs, net; exploration expenses; DD asset impairments; asset disposition gains and losses; non-cash share-based compensation; non-cash valuation changes for derivatives and financial instruments; restructuring and transaction costs; accretion on discounted liabilities; and other items not related to our normal operations. Field-Level Cash Margin is computed as oil, gas and NGL sales less production expenses. Production expenses consist of lease operating, gathering, processing and transportation expenses, as well as production and property taxes. 
 We exclude financing costs from EBITDAX to assess our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. Exploration expenses and asset disposition gains and losses are excluded from EBITDAX because they generally are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. DD A and impairments are excluded from EBITDAX because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. We exclude share-based compensation, valuation changes, restructuring and transaction costs, accretion on discounted liabilities and other items from EBITDAX because they are not considered a measure of asset operating performance. 
 We believe EBITDAX and Field-Level Cash Margin provide information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods. EBITDAX and Field-Level Cash Margin as defined by Devon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net earnings from operations. 
 Below are reconciliations of net earnings to EBITDAX and a further reconciliation to Field-Level Cash Margin.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have commodity derivatives that pertain to a portion of our estimated production for the last three months of 2024, as well as for 2025 and 2026. The key terms to our open oil, gas and NGL derivative financial instruments are presented in Note 3 in Part I. Financial Information Item 1. Financial Statements in this report. 
 The fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by the forward curves of the relevant price indices. At September 30, 2024, a 10 change in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net positions by approximately 195 million. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 At September 30, 2024, we had total debt of 8.9 billion. 7.9 billion of this debt was comprised of debentures and notes that have fixed interest rates which average 5.7 . We also have a 1.0 billion Term Loan which has a variable interest rate that is adjusted monthly. The interest rate on the Term Loan was 6.33 at September 30, 2024.

(b) By Devon . Devon agrees to indemnify and reimburse, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Selling Holder, and each of its employees, advisors, agents, representatives, partners, officers, and directors and each Person who controls such Selling Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) (collectively, the Seller Affiliates (i) against any and all Losses based upon, arising out of, related to or resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact necessary to be stated therein to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (ii) against any and all Losses to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon, arising out of, related to or resulting from any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, and (iii) against any and all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of counsel) as may be reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon, arising out of, related to or resulting from any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, or such violation of the Securities Act or Exchange Act, to the extent that any such reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expense or cost is not paid under clause (i) or (ii) above; except insofar as any such statements are made in reliance upon information furnished to Devon in writing by such Selling Holder or any Seller Affiliate expressly for use therein. 

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification provided that the failure to give such notice shall not limit the rights of 

7 

such Person) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided , however , that any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ one separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person unless (A) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses or (B) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such person. If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party as permitted hereunder, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its prior written consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If such defense is assumed by the indemnifying party pursuant to the provisions hereof, such indemnifying party shall not settle or otherwise compromise the applicable claim unless (i) such settlement or compromise contains a full and unconditional release of the indemnified party or (ii) the indemnified party otherwise consents in writing (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party, a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such additional counsel or counsels. 

(d) Contribution . If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.05 is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to any indemnified party or is insufficient to hold them harmless in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of such indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided , however , that in no event shall such Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the dollar amount of net proceeds received by such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification, except in cases of fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact has been made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to include any 

8 

legal and other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any Loss which is the subject of this paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
