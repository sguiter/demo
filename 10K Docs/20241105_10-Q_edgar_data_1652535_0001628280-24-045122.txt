 Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 differs from the statutory rate primarily due to taxes on foreign income that differs from the U.S. tax rate, including a tax holiday in Singapore from which we will benefit through 2026, and a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. 
 Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 differs from the statutory rate primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as taxes on foreign income that differ from the U.S. tax rate, including a tax holiday in Singapore from which we will benefit through 2026. We recorded an million valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2023 based on an assessment of available positive and negative evidence, including an estimate of being in a cumulative loss position in the U.S. by the end of 2023, projections of future taxable income, and other quantitative and qualitative information. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the valuation allowance. 
 The ending balance for the unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions was approximately million as of September 27, 2024, of which million relates to estimated interest and penalties. The uncertain tax positions that are reasonably possible to decrease in the next twelve months are insignificant.

Overview 
 
 We are a leader in the design, engineering, and manufacturing of critical fluid delivery subsystems and components for semiconductor capital equipment. Our product offerings include gas and chemical delivery systems and subsystems, collectively known as fluid delivery systems and subsystems, which are key elements of the process tools used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices. Our gas delivery subsystems deliver, monitor, and control precise quantities of the specialized gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes such as etch and deposition. Our chemical delivery systems and subsystems precisely blend and dispense the reactive liquid chemistries used in semiconductor manufacturing processes such as chemical-mechanical planarization, electroplating, and cleaning. We also provide precision-machined components, weldments, e beam and laser-welded components, precision vacuum and hydrogen brazing, surface treatment technologies, and other proprietary products. This vertically integrated portion of our business is primarily focused on metal and plastic parts that are used in gas and chemical systems, respectively. 
 Fluid delivery subsystems ensure accurate measurement and uniform delivery of specialty gases and chemicals at critical steps in the semiconductor manufacturing processes. Any malfunction or material degradation in fluid delivery reduces yields and increases the likelihood of manufacturing defects in these processes. Most OEMs outsource all or a portion of the design, engineering, and manufacturing of their gas delivery subsystems to a few specialized suppliers, including us. Additionally, many OEMs are outsourcing the design, engineering, and manufacturing of their chemical delivery subsystems due to the increased fluid expertise required to manufacture these subsystems. Outsourcing these subsystems has allowed OEMs to leverage suppliers highly specialized engineering, design, and production skills while focusing their internal resources on their own value-added processes. 
 We have a global footprint with production facilities in California, Minnesota, Oregon, Texas, Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Korea, and Mexico. 
 The following table summarizes key financial information for the periods indicated. Amounts are presented in accordance with GAAP unless explicitly identified as being a non-GAAP metric. For a description of our non-GAAP metrics and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP metrics, please refer below to the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Results within this report.

Macroeconomic Conditions and Business Update 
 
 The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature. The industry entered a cyclical downturn in the fourth quarter of 2022 for the primary markets we serve, leading to reductions in spending on semiconductor capital equipment, which resulted in weakened customer demand. In particular, industry overcapacity and a number of macroeconomic factors may have contributed to this reduced spending environment, which combined with increased export controls for advanced semiconductor-related goods and services shipped to China and delayed business investment in electronic memory capacity had varying levels of unfavorable consequences to our business. Although the total market for semiconductor capital equipment has experienced year-over-year stability and growth, inventory digestion at our customers and the relative spending levels within our primary served markets, in particular lower spending levels for deposition and etch equipment, has resulted in demand from our customers persisting at lower levels over the past two years relative to the total semiconductor capital equipment market. To help mitigate these impacts and to better align our resources and cost structure with current and expected future levels of business, we initiated labor cost reduction initiatives starting in the fourth quarter of 2022, which continued through the second quarter of 2024. We did not initiate further, or continue, labor cost reduction initiatives in the third quarter of 2024. 
 While challenging macroeconomic conditions have impacted and will continue to impact our business and customers in the near term, we believe demand for semiconductors, semiconductor capital equipment, and our products will return to growth, fueled by the long-term growing need for more semiconductor productive capacity and enhanced process technologies.

Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 
 
 Net sales 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount (dollars in thousands) Net sales 211,139 196,761 14,378 7.3 615,749 607,639 8,110 1.3 
 The increase in net sales from the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to increased customer demand as a result of a stronger semiconductor capital equipment spending environment. Further detail is provided above under the section entitled Macroeconomic Conditions and Business Update .

Gross margin 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount (dollars in thousands) Cost of sales 183,348 172,692 10,656 539,407 524,588 14,819 Gross profit 27,791 24,069 3,722 76,342 83,051 (6,709) Gross margin 13.2 12.2 +100 bps 12.4 13.7 -130 bps 
 The increase in gross margin from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory expense (+120bps), lower severance costs associated with our global reduction-in-force programs (+40bps), partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and higher fixed factory overhead costs (-20bps). 
 The decrease in gross margin from the nine months ended September 29, 2023 to the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix, increased fixed factory overhead costs (-40bps), and increased excess and obsolete inventory expense (-10bps), partially offset by lower severance costs associated with our global reduction-in-force programs (+20bps). 
 Research and development 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount (dollars in thousands) Research and development 5,872 5,188 684 13.2 17,168 14,689 2,479 16.9 
 The increase in research and development expenses from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to increased material and service costs from our new product development programs of 0.5 million and increased employee-related expenses of 0.2 million, inclusive of share-based compensation expense. 
 The increase from the nine months ended September 29, 2023 to the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to increased material and service costs from our new product development programs of 1.7 million and increased employee-related expenses of 0.8 million, inclusive of share-based compensation expense. 
 Selling, general, and administrative 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount (dollars in thousands) Selling, general, and administrative 20,227 20,066 161 0.8 59,253 59,733 (480) (0.8) 
 Overall, our selling, general, and administrative expenses remained approximately unchanged from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. 
 The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense from the nine months ended September 29, 2023 to the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to reduced share-based compensation expense of 2.0 million, partially offset by 0.8 million in transaction-related costs from our acquisitions pipeline and 0.5 million in costs from exiting and consolidating one of our U.S.-based manufacturing facilities incurred during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 only.

Amortization of intangible assets 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount (dollars in thousands) Amortization of intangible assets 2,077 3,639 (1,562) (42.9) 6,309 11,565 (5,256) (45.4) 
 The decrease in amortization expense from the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 was due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the second half of 2023. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount (dollars in thousands) Interest expense, net 1,638 5,136 (3,498) (68.1) 7,592 14,716 (7,124) (48.4) Weighted average borrowings outstanding 131,250 292,630 (161,380) (55.1) 169,430 298,553 (129,123) (43.2) Weighted average borrowing rate 7.23 7.06 +17 bps 7.43 6.60 +83 bps 
 The decrease in interest expense, net from the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to decreases in the weighted average amounts borrowed, partially offset by an increase in our weighted average borrowing rate. 
 Other expense, net 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount (dollars in thousands) Other expense, net 587 29 558 1924.1 876 913 (37) (4.1) 
 The change in other expense, net from the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to currency exchange rate fluctuations during the periods related to our local currency payables of our foreign operations. 
 19 

Income tax expense 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Amount (dollars in thousands) Income tax expense 166 436 (270) (61.9) 2,021 12,521 (10,500) (83.9) Loss before income taxes (2,610) (9,989) 7,379 (73.9) (14,856) (18,565) 3,709 (20.0) Effective income tax rate -6.4 -4.4 -200 bps -13.6 -67.4 +5,380 bps 
 The decrease in income tax expense from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to decreased foreign taxable income. 
 The decrease in income tax expense from the nine months ended September 29, 2023 to the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to recording a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2023, resulting in an 11.1 million charge to income tax expense. Because we have a valuation allowance recorded against our U.S. state and federal deferred income taxes, we did not record tax benefits from our U.S. taxable losses during the nine months ended September 27, 2024. 
 
 Non GAAP Financial Results 
 
 Management uses certain non-GAAP metrics to evaluate our operating and financial results. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors ability to view our results from management s perspective. All non-GAAP adjustments are presented on a gross basis. Non-GAAP gross profit, operating income, and net income (loss) are defined as: gross profit, operating income (loss), or net income (loss), respectively, excluding (1) amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, and discrete or infrequent charges and gains that are outside of normal business operations, including transaction-related costs, contract and legal settlement gains and losses, facility shutdown costs, and severance costs associated with reduction-in-force programs, to the extent they are present in gross profit, operating income (loss), and net income (loss), respectively; and (2) with respect to non-GAAP net income (loss), the tax impacts associated with these non-GAAP adjustments, as well as non-recurring discrete tax items, including deferred tax asset valuation allowance charges. All non-GAAP adjustments are presented on a gross basis; the related income tax effects, including current and deferred income tax expense, are included in the adjustment line under the heading "Tax adjustments related to non-GAAP adjustments". Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share ("EPS") is defined as non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average diluted ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin are defined as non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating income, respectively, divided by net sales. 
 Non-GAAP results have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP results differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, both of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP results as a tool for comparison. 
 Because of these limitations, you should consider non-GAAP results alongside other financial performance measures and results presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, in evaluating non-GAAP results, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses such as those that are the subject of adjustments in deriving non-GAAP results and you should not infer from our presentation of non-GAAP results that our future results will not be affected by these expenses or other discrete or infrequent charges and gains that are outside of normal business operations.

The following table presents our unaudited non GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP diluted EPS and a reconciliation from GAAP net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated. All non-GAAP adjustments are presented on a gross basis; the related income tax effects, including current and deferred income tax expense, are included in the adjustment line under the heading "Tax adjustments related to non-GAAP adjustments". 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) U.S. GAAP net loss (2,776) (10,425) (16,877) (31,086) Non-GAAP adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets 2,077 3,639 6,309 11,565 Share-based compensation 4,672 4,752 10,985 12,666 Transaction-related costs (1) 785 Other (2) 793 1,600 2,117 Tax adjustments related to non-GAAP adjustments (3) 47 3,338 325 7,576 Tax expense from valuation allowance (4) 11,094 Non-GAAP net income (loss) 4,020 2,097 3,127 13,932 U.S. GAAP diluted EPS (0.08) (0.36) (0.52) (1.07) Non-GAAP diluted EPS 0.12 0.07 0.10 0.47 Shares used to compute non-GAAP diluted EPS 33,986,269 29,733,904 32,851,091 29,507,060

 (2) Represents severance costs associated with our global reduction-in-force programs. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, this amount includes 0.5 million of costs incurred in connection with exiting and consolidating one of our U.S.-based manufacturing facilities. 
 (3) Adjusts GAAP income tax expense for the impact of our non-GAAP adjustments, which are presented on a gross basis. During the second quarter of 2023, we recorded a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets on a GAAP basis. In the first quarter of 2024, we determined that the valuation allowance should be recognized against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets on a non-GAAP basis as we were not in a three-year cumulative U.S. income position on a non-GAAP basis. Accordingly, from the first quarter of 2024 and forward, tax expense on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis reflects a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. 
 (4) During the second quarter of 2023, we recorded a valuation allowance of 11.1 million against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded based on an assessment of available positive and negative evidence, including an estimate of being in a three-year cumulative loss position in the U.S. by the end of 2023, projections of future taxable income, and other quantitative and qualitative information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The following section discusses our liquidity and capital resources, including our primary sources of liquidity and our material cash requirements. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid and accessible accounts with no significant restrictions. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our primary liquidity requirements arise from: (i) working capital requirements, including procurement of raw materials inventory for use in our factories and employee-related costs, (ii) business acquisitions, (iii) interest and principal payments under our credit facilities, (iv) research and development investments, (v) capital expenditures, and (vi) payment of income taxes. We have no significant long-term purchase commitments related to procuring raw materials inventory. Our ability to fund these material cash requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance, and our continued access to the capital markets and are therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, the amounts available under our credit facilities, and our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our business and our current obligations for at least the next 12 months and beyond. 
 Sources and Conditions of Liquidity 
 Our ongoing sources of liquidity to fund our material cash requirements are primarily derived from: (i) sales to our customers and the related changes in our net operating assets and liabilities and (ii) proceeds from our credit facilities and equity offerings, when applicable. Our credit facilities are comprised of a 150.0 million term loan facility and a 250.0 million revolving credit facility, of which 250.0 million remained available to draw on as of September 27, 2024. 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 We ended the third quarter of 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of 116.4 million, an increase of 36.5 million from the prior year ended December 29, 2023. The increase was primarily due to net proceeds of 136.7 million from our issuance of 3.8 million ordinary shares in March 2024 in connection with an underwritten public offering and net cash provided by operating activities of 30.4 million, partially offset by net payments on credit facilities of 118.8 million and capital expenditures of 13.2 million. 
 The following table sets forth a summary of operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 (in thousands) Cash provided by operating activities 30,368 20,058 Cash used in investing activities (13,238) (13,239) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 19,362 (17,356) Net increase (decrease) in cash 36,492 (10,537) 
 Our cash provided by operating activities of 30.4 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 consisted of net non-cash charges of 33.9 million, consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization of 22.8 million and share-based compensation expense of 11.0 million, and a decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities of 13.4 million, partially offset by net loss of 16.9 million. 
 The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities of 13.4 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable of 22.7 million and a decrease in inventories of 6.5 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 17.4 million. 
 23 

Compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023, higher cash provided by operating activities of 10.3 million in the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to 10.7 million in favorable changes in the balances of our working capital accounts. 
 Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 consisted of capital expenditures. 
 Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 consisted of net proceeds of 136.7 million from our issuance of 3.8 million ordinary shares in March 2024 in connection with an underwritten public offering and net proceeds from share-based compensation activity of 1.4 million, partially offset by net payment on our credit facilities of 118.8 million. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 consisted of net payments on our credit facilities of 20.6 million, partially offset by net proceeds from share-based compensation activity of 3.3 million. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. 
 The critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are identified and described in our annual consolidated financial statements and the notes included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Substantially all of our sales arrangement with customers, and the significant majority of our arrangements with third-party suppliers, provide for pricing and payment in U.S. dollars and, therefore, are not subject to material exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, we do not expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to have a material effect on our results of operations. However, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive relative to competing products priced in such other currencies, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could result in our foreign suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. 
 
 We have certain operating expenses that are denominated in currencies of the countries in which our operations are located and may be subject to fluctuations due to foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Singapore dollar, Malaysian ringgit, British pound, euro, Korean won, and Mexican peso. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to our financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We had total indebtedness of 131.3 million as of September 27, 2024, exclusive of 1.0 million in debt issuance costs, of which 7.5 million was due within 12 months. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. We have not been, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. As of September 27, 2024, the interest rate on our outstanding debt is based on BSBY, plus an applicable rate depending on our leverage ratio. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate on our outstanding debt would have resulted in a 0.3 million change to interest expense during the quarter, or 1.3 million on an annualized basis. 
 24 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the "certifying officers"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based on this evaluation, our certifying officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 27, 2024. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we cannot provide reliable financial information, our business, operating results, and share price could be negatively impacted. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are currently not a party to any material pending or threatened litigation. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 This quarterly report should be read in conjunction with the risk factors included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10 K. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.
