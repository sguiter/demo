FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains information that may constitute forward-looking statements. Generally, the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, project, will, should, could, may, plan and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future including statements relating to volume growth, share of sales and earnings per share growth, and statements expressing general views about future operating results are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, and those described from time to time in reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 The forward-looking statements contained in this report involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including statements concerning: 
 
 our, or our portfolio companies , future operating results; 
 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 
 the return or impact of current or future investments that we expect to make; 
 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 
 the impact of global events outside of our control, including, the consequences of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, on our and our portfolio companies business and the global economy; 
 uncertainty surrounding inflation and the financial stability of the United States, Europe, and China; 
 the financial condition of, and ability of our current and prospective portfolio companies to, achieve their objectives; 
 difficulty in obtaining financing or raising capital, especially in the current credit and equity environment, and the impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our and our portfolio companies business; 
 the level, duration and volatility of prevailing interest rates and credit spreads, magnified by the current turmoil in the credit markets; 
 the impact of alternative reference rates on our business and certain of our investments; 
 adverse developments in the availability of desirable loan and investment opportunities whether they are due to competition, regulation or otherwise; 
 a compression of the yield on our investments and the cost of our liabilities, as well as the level of leverage available to us; 
 the impact of changes in laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our portfolio companies; 
 our regulatory structure and tax treatment, including our ability to operate as a business development company and a regulated investment company; 
 the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; 
 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; 
 the ability of our investment adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 
 the timing, form and amount of any dividend distributions; 
 authoritative generally accepted accounting principles or policy changes from such standard-setting bodies as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Internal Revenue Service, the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the New York Stock Exchange LLC, and other authorities that we are subject to, as well as their counterparts in any foreign jurisdictions where we might do business; and

and of our total assets at fair value are in non-accrual status, respectively. 
 Some of our loans and other investments may have contractual PIK interest or dividends. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, we capitalize the accrued interest (reflecting such amounts in the basis as additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point that we believe PIK is not fully expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income, respectively. We do not reverse previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status if we believe that PIK is expected to be realized. 

Realized gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method. Refer to Investment Transactions above.

 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, management and the independent valuation firm look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. These investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 The fair value of debt investments specifically classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy are generally valued by an independent pricing agent or more than one principal market maker, if available, otherwise a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. We generally value over-the-counter securities by using the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers during the relevant period end, which were provided by an independent pricing agent and screened for validity by such service. 
 In determining the range of values for debt instruments where market quotations are not readily available, and are therefore classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except CLOs and debt investments in controlling portfolio companies, management and the independent valuation firm estimated corporate and security credit ratings and identified corresponding yields to maturity for each loan from relevant market data. A discounted cash flow technique was then applied using the appropriate yield to maturity as the discount rate, to determine a range of values. In determining the range of values for debt investments of controlled companies and equity investments, the enterprise value was determined by applying a market approach such as using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA multiples, net income and/or book value multiples for similar guideline public companies and/or similar recent investment transactions and/or an income approach, such as the discounted cash flow technique. The enterprise value technique may also be used to value debt investments which are credit impaired. For stressed debt and equity investments, asset recovery analysis was used.

Series M Clawback , if applicable, means an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all dividends, whether paid or accrued, on such share of Series M Stock in the three full months prior to the Holder Conversion Exercise Date. Subject to certain limited exceptions, we will not pay any portion of the Settlement Amount in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the anniversary of the date on which a share of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock has been issued. Beginning on the anniversary of the date on which a share of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock is issued, we may elect to settle all or a portion of any Holder Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. The right of holders to convert a share of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock will terminate upon the listing of such share on a national securities exchange. Shares of the Floating Rate Preferred Stock do not have a Holder Optional Conversion feature. 
 Subject to certain limited exceptions allowing earlier redemption, beginning on the earlier of the anniversary of the date on which a share of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock has been issued, or the anniversary of the date on which a share of Floating Rate Preferred Stock has been issued or, for listed shares of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock, from the earliest date on which any series that has been listed was first issued and for listed shares of Floating Rate Preferred Stock, from the earliest date on which any series that has been listed was first issued (the earlier of such dates as applicable to a series of Preferred Stock, the Redemption Eligibility Date ), such share of Preferred Stock may be redeemed at any time or from time to time at our option (the Issuer Optional Redemption ), at a redemption price of of the Stated Value of the shares to be redeemed plus unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. 
 Shares of the Floating Rate Preferred Stock are redeemable, at the option of the holder of such Floating Rate Preferred Stock, on a monthly basis (the Holder Optional Redemption ). For all shares of Floating Rate Preferred Stock duly submitted for redemption on or before a monthly Holder Redemption Deadline (defined in the prospectus supplement dated December 29, 2023), the HOR Settlement Amount (as defined below) is determined on any business day after such Holder Redemption Deadline but before the Holder Redemption Deadline occurring two months thereafter (such date, the Holder Redemption Exercise Date ). Within such period, we may select the Holder Redemption Exercise Date in our sole discretion. We will settle

of the outstanding Floating Rate Preferred Stock, in aggregate, as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter will be redeemed per calendar month; (ii) no more than of the outstanding Floating Rate Preferred Stock, in aggregate, as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter will be redeemed per fiscal quarter and (iii) no more than of the outstanding Floating Rate Preferred Stock, in aggregate, as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter will be redeemed per Annual Redemption Period. An Annual Redemption Period means our then current fiscal quarter and the three fiscal quarters immediately preceding our then current fiscal quarter. A share of Series A4 Preferred Stock is subject to an early redemption fee if it is redeemed by its holder within of issuance. Redemption capacity of the Floating Rate Preferred Stock will be allocated on a pro rata basis based on the number of shares of Floating Rate Preferred Stock, as applicable, submitted in the event that a monthly redemption is oversubscribed, based on any of the foregoing redemption limits. We may waive the foregoing redemption limits in our sole discretion at any time. 
 For the Series A4 Preferred Stock, HOR Settlement Amount means (A) the stated value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Redemption Exercise Date, minus (C) the Series A4 Preferred Stock Holder Optional Redemption fee applicable on the respective Holder Redemption Deadline. 
 For the Series M4 Preferred Stock, HOR Settlement Amount means (A) the stated value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Redemption Exercise Date, but if a holder of Series M4 Preferred Stock exercises a Holder Optional Redemption within the first twenty-four months of issuance of such Series M4 Preferred Stock, the HOR Settlement Amount payable to such holder will be reduced by (i) during the first twelve months of issuance of such Series M4 Preferred Stock, the aggregate amount of all dividends, whether paid or accrued, on such Series M4 Preferred Stock in the six-month period prior to the Holder Redemption Exercise Date, and (ii) during the second twelve months of issuance of such Series M4 Preferred Stock, the aggregate amount of all dividends, whether paid or accrued, on such Series M4 Preferred Stock in the three-month period prior to the Holder Redemption Exercise Date (such amount, the Series M4 Shares Clawback ). We are permitted to waive the Series M4 Shares Clawback through public announcement of the terms and duration of such waiver. Any such waiver would apply to any holder of Preferred Stock qualifying for the waiver and exercising a Holder Optional Redemption during the pendency of the term of such waiver. Although we have retained the right to waive the Series M4 Shares Clawback in the manner described above, we are not required to establish any such waivers and we may never establish any such waivers. 
 Subject to certain limitations, each share of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock may be converted at our option (the Issuer Optional Conversion ). We will settle any Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the VWAP, subject to our ability to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value if the VWAP represents a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock. For the Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock, IOC Settlement Amount means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for conversion. In connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value. If we do not have or obtain any required stockholder approval under the 1940 Act to sell our common stock below net asset value and the VWAP is at a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock, we will settle any conversions in connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the NAV per share of common stock at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of conversion. We will not pay any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount from an Issuer Optional Conversion in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the Redemption Eligibility Date. Beginning on the Redemption Eligibility Date, we may elect to settle any Issuer Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. In the event that we exercise an Issuer Optional Conversion with respect to any shares of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock, the holder of such Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock may instead elect a Holder Optional Conversion with respect to such Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock provided that the date of conversion for such Holder Optional Conversion would occur prior to the date of conversion for an Issuer Optional Conversion. Shares of the Floating Rate Preferred Stock do not have an Issuer Optional Conversion feature. The Company actively manages its offerings of preferred stock and, although it may or may not be presently offering a particular series of its preferred stock, the Company may determine to issue any of its authorized series of preferred stock (and, in connection therewith, to relaunch the offering of any particular series, if previously terminated) based on its assessment of market conditions, demand, and appropriate cost of capital in light of the foregoing and the overall construction of its portfolio and capital structure.

shares, or in aggregate liquidation preference, of our Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value per share (the Series A Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock ), at a public offering price of per share. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we also granted the underwriters a option to purchase up to an additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock solely to cover over-allotments. The offer settled on July 19, 2021, and no additional shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were issued pursuant to the option. In connection with such offering, on July 15, 2021, we filed Articles Supplementary with SDAT, reclassifying and designating shares of the Company s authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock into shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 
 Each series of Preferred Stock, Preferred Stock, Floating Rate Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock ranks (with respect to the payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) (a) senior to our common stock, (b) on parity with each other series of our preferred stock, and (c) junior to our existing and future secured and unsecured indebtedness . See Note 8, Fair Value and Maturity of Debt Outstanding for further discussion on our senior securities. 
 We may from time to time seek to cancel or purchase our outstanding preferred stock through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The amounts involved may be material. Any such purchases or exchanges of preferred stock would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. On June 16, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares our Series A Preferred Stock and further on October 11, 2023, authorized any and all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock to be repurchased. The manner, price, volume and timing of preferred share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased shares of Series A Preferred Stock for a total cost of approximately , including fees and commissions paid to the broker, representing an average repurchase price of per share. The difference in the consideration transferred and the net carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock repurchased, which was , resulted in a gain applicable to common stock holders of approximately during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The repurchased shares reverted to authorized but unissued shares of Series A Preferred Stock and thus the Company holds no treasury stock. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we exchanged an aggregate of Series M1 Preferred Stock for an aggregate of and newly-issued Series M3 Preferred Stock and Series M4 Preferred Stock, respectively, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we exchanged an aggregate of Series M3 Preferred Stock for an aggregate of newly-issued Series M4 Preferred Stock pursuant to the Securities Act. 
 The Series M3 Preferred Stock and Series M4 Preferred Stock issued in the exchanges were issued in each case to an existing security holder of the Company exclusively in exchange for such holder s securities. No commission or other remuneration was paid or given for soliciting the exchange. Stockholders who exchange Series M1 Preferred Stock for Series M3 Preferred Stock or Series M4 Preferred Stock or Series M3 Preferred Stock for Series M4 Preferred Stock will receive unpaid dividends on their Series M1 Preferred Stock or Series M3 Preferred Stock accrued to, but not including, the Exchange Exercise Date, plus any fractional amount of a Series M1 Preferred Stock or Series M3 Preferred Stock exchanged multiplied by in cash. Upon settlement, the carrying amount (including any premiums or discounts and a proportional amount of any issuance costs) of the Series M1 Preferred Stock or Series M3 Preferred Stock are reclassified to Series M3 Preferred Stock or Series M4 Preferred stock , respectively, with no gain or loss recognized . 
 Subject to certain limited exceptions allowing earlier redemption, at any time after the close of business on July 19, 2026 (any such date, an Optional Redemption Date ), at our sole option, we may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in whole or, from time to time, in part, out of funds legally available for such redemption, at a price per share equal to the liquidation preference of per share, plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends on such shares (whether or not earned or declared, but excluding interest thereon) accumulated up to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption. We may also redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or, from time to time, in part, including prior to the Optional Redemption Date, pro rata, based on liquidation preference, with all other series of our then outstanding preferred stock, in the event that our Board of Directors determines to redeem any series of our preferred stock, in whole or, from time to time, in part, because such redemption is deemed necessary by our Board of Directors to comply with the asset coverage requirements of the 1940 Act or for us to maintain RIC status.

To the extent that we exercise our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right relating to the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will not be permitted to exercise the conversion right described below in respect of their shares called for redemption. 
 Except to the extent that we have elected to exercise our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right by providing notice of redemption prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined below), upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to convert some or all of the Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of our shares of common stock per Series A Preferred Stock to be converted equal to the lesser of: 
 the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of the Liquidation Preference per share plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not earned or declared, but excluding interest thereon) accumulated up to, but excluding, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Record Date for a Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment and prior to the corresponding Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in this sum) by (ii) the Common Stock Price (as defined below); and 
 , subject to certain adjustments, 
 subject, in each case, to provisions for the receipt of alternative consideration upon conversion as described in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
 If we have provided or provide a redemption notice with respect to some or all of the Series A Preferred Stock, holders of any Series A Preferred Stock that we have called for redemption will not be permitted to exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right in respect of any of their Series A Preferred Stock that have been called for redemption, and any Series A Preferred Stock subsequently called for redemption that have been tendered for conversion will be redeemed on the applicable date of redemption instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. 
 For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a redemption upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, the following definitions are applicable: 
 Change of Control Triggering Event means the occurrence of any of the following: 
 the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation and other than an Excluded Transaction) in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Controlled Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any person or group (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than to any Permitted Holders); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, a pledge of assets pursuant to any of our secured debt instruments or the secured debt instruments of our Controlled Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be any such sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or disposition; or 
 the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation and other than an Excluded Transaction) the result of which is that any person or group (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than any Permitted Holders) becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50 of our outstanding Voting Stock, measured by voting power rather than number of shares. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the consummation of any of the transactions referred to in the bullet points above will not be deemed a Change of Control Triggering Event if we or the acquiring or surviving consolidated entity has or continues to have a class of common securities (or ADRs representing such securities) listed on the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ, or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ, or is otherwise listed or quoted on a national securities exchange. 
 The Change of Control Conversion Date is the date the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be converted, which will be a business day selected by us that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which we provide the notice described above to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock.

 on our total assets. For services currently rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. The total gross base management fee incurred to the favor of the Investment Adviser was and , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The incentive fee has parts. The first part, the income incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees and other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement described below, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of per quarter annualized). 
 The net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of the gross assets used to calculate the base management fee. We pay the Investment Adviser an income incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 No incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; 
 of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than of the quarterly hurdle rate in any calendar quarter annualized assuming a annualized hurdle rate); and 
 of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds of the quarterly hurdle rate in any calendar quarter annualized assuming a annualized hurdle rate). 
 These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter.

of our realized capital gains for the calendar year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation at the end of such year. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Investment Adviser, we calculate the aggregate realized capital gains, aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, as applicable, with respect to each investment that has been in our portfolio. For the purpose of this calculation, an investment is defined as the total of all rights and claims which may be asserted against a portfolio company arising from our participation in the debt, equity, and other financial instruments issued by that company. Aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equal the sum of the differences between the aggregate net sales price of each investment and the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate realized capital losses equal the sum of the amounts by which the aggregate net sales price of each investment is less than the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the differences, if negative, between the aggregate valuation of each investment and the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment as of the applicable calendar year-end. At the end of the applicable calendar year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains incentive fee involves netting aggregate realized capital gains against aggregate realized capital losses on a since-inception basis and then reducing this amount by the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation. If this number is positive, then the capital gains incentive fee payable is equal to of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid since inception. 
 The total income incentive fee incurred was and , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. capital gains incentive fee was incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 Administration Agreement 
 We have also entered into an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with Prospect Administration under which Prospect Administration, among other things, provides (or arranges for the provision of) administrative services and facilities for us. For providing these services, we reimburse Prospect Administration for our allocable portion of overhead incurred by Prospect Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and her staff, including the internal legal staff. Under this agreement, Prospect Administration furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities. Prospect Administration also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, Prospect Administration assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Under the Administration Agreement, Prospect Administration also provides on our behalf managerial assistance to certain portfolio companies (see Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies section below). The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon days written notice to the other party. Prospect Administration is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Investment Adviser. 
 The Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, Prospect Administration and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Prospect Administration s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as administrator for us. Our payments to Prospect Administration are reviewed quarterly by our Board of Directors. 
 The allocation of net overhead expense from Prospect Administration was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Prospect Administration received estimated payments of and directly from our portfolio companies and certain funds managed by the Investment Adviser for legal, tax, and other administrative services during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. We were given a credit for these payments as a reduction of the administrative services cost payable by us to Prospect Administration. Had Prospect Administration not received these payments, Prospect Administration s charges for its administrative services would have increased by this amount.

 Co-Investments 
 On January 13, 2020 (amended on August 2, 2022), we received an exemptive order from the SEC (the Order ), which superseded a prior co-investment exemptive order granted on February 10, 2014, that gave us the ability to negotiate terms other than price and quantity of co-investment transactions with other funds managed by the Investment Adviser or certain affiliates, including Priority Income Fund, Inc. and Prospect Floating Rate and Alternative Income Fund, Inc., where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions included therein. 
 Under the terms of the relief permitting us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Investment Adviser or its affiliates, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. In certain situations where a co-investment with one or more funds managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates is not covered by the Order, such as when there is an opportunity to invest in different securities of the same issuer, the personnel of the Investment Adviser or its affiliates will need to decide which fund will proceed with the investment. Such personnel will make these determinations based on policies and procedures, which are designed to reasonably ensure that investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among affiliated funds over time and in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Moreover, except in certain circumstances, when relying on the Order, we will be unable to invest in any issuer in which one or more funds managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates has previously invested.

Investment Valuation 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, management and the independent valuation firm look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. These investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 The fair value of debt investments specifically classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy are generally valued by an independent pricing agent or more than one principal market maker, if available, otherwise a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. We generally value over-the-counter securities by using the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers during the relevant period end, which were provided by an independent pricing agent and screened for validity by such service. 
 In determining the range of values for debt instruments where market quotations are not readily available, and are therefore classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except CLOs and debt investments in controlling portfolio companies, management and the independent valuation firm estimated corporate and security credit ratings and identified corresponding yields to maturity for each loan from relevant market data. A discounted cash flow technique was then applied using the appropriate yield to maturity as the discount rate, to determine a range of values. In determining the range of values for debt investments of controlled companies and equity investments, the enterprise value was determined by applying a market approach such as using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA multiples, net income and/or book value multiples for similar guideline public companies and/or similar recent investment transactions and/or an income approach, such as the discounted cash flow technique. The enterprise value technique may also be used to value debt investments which are credit impaired. For stressed debt and equity investments, asset recovery analysis was used. 
 In determining the range of values for our investments in CLOs, the independent valuation firm uses a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The valuations were accomplished through the analysis of the CLO deal structures to identify the risk exposures from the modeling point of view as well as to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations, which are simulations used to model the probability of different outcomes, to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows for the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market and certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the corresponding multi-path cash flow model. 
 With respect to our online consumer and SME lending initiative, we invest primarily in marketplace loans through marketplace lending platforms. We do not conduct loan origination activities ourselves. Therefore, our ability to purchase consumer and SME loans, and our ability to grow our portfolio of consumer and SME loans, are directly influenced by the business performance and competitiveness of the marketplace loan origination business of the marketplace lending platforms from which we purchase consumer and SME loans. In addition, our ability to analyze the risk-return profile of consumer and SME loans is significantly dependent on the marketplace platforms ability to effectively evaluate a borrower s credit profile and likelihood of default. If we are unable to effectively evaluate borrowers credit profiles or the credit decisioning and scoring models implemented by each platform, we may incur unanticipated losses which could adversely impact our operating results. 
 The Board of Directors looked at several factors in determining where within the range to valu e the asset including: recent operating and financial trends for the asset, independent ratings obtained from third parties, comparable multiples for recent sales of companies within the industry and discounted cash flow models for ou r investments in CLOs. The composite of all these various valuation techniques, applied to each investment, was a total valuatio n of 7,476,641. 
 Our portfolio companies are generally lower middle-market companies, outside of the financial sector, with less than 100,000 of annual EBITDA. We believe our investment portfolio has experienced less volatility than others because we believe there are more buy and hold investors who own these less liquid investments.

Control Company Investments 
 Control investments offer increased risk and reward over straight debt investments. Operating results and changes in market multiples can result in dramatic changes in values from quarter to quarter. Significant downturns in operations can further result in our looking to recoveries on sales of assets rather than the enterprise value of the investment. Equity positions in our portfolio are susceptible to potentially significant changes in value, both increases as well as decreases, due to changes in operating results and market multiples. Our controlled companies discussed below experienced such changes and we recorded corresponding fluctuations in valuations during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 InterDent, Inc. 
 Prospect owns 100 of the equity of InterDent, Inc. InterDent is a dental support organization DSO ).

 The fair value of our investment in InterDent was 403,727 as of September 30, 2024, a premium of 35,409 to its amortized cost basis compared to a fair value of 463,883 as of June 30, 2024, a premium of 102,337 to its amortized cost. The decrease in premium to amortized cost was driven by a decline in financial performance and increased debt in the capital structure.

 The fair value of our investment in Valley Electric was 305,384 as of September 30, 2024, a premium of 209,472 to its amortized cost, compared to a fair value of 316,419 as of June 30, 2024, representing a 220,508 premium to its amortized cost. The decrease in premium to amortized cost resulted from modest changes to timing of ongoing and future projects. 
 
 Our controlled investments, including those discussed above, are valued at 417,912 above their amortized cost as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Affiliate and Non-Control Company Investments 
 We ho ld two affiliate investments at September 30, 2024 (Nixon, Inc. and RGIS Services, LLC, RGIS )) with a total fair value of 21,658, a premium of 9,923 from their combined amortized cost, compared to a fair value as 18,069 of June 30, 2024, representing a 6,475 premium to its amortized cost. The increase in premium to amortized cost was driven by an improvement in RGIS s financial performance. 
 With the non-control/non-affiliate investments, generally, there is less volatility related to our total investments because our equity positions tend to be smaller than with our control/affiliate investments, and debt investments are generally not as susceptible to large swings in value as equity investments. For debt investments, the fair value is generally limited on the high side to each loan s par value, plus any prepayment premium that could be imposed. Note that three of our non-control/non-affiliate investments, Credit.com Holdings, LLC, Town Country Holdings, Inc. Town Country ), and our CLO investment portfolio, have larger equity positions and are therefore more susceptible to changes in value than the rest of our non-control/non-affiliate investments. As of September 30, 2024 , our non-control/non-affiliate portfolio is valued at a discount to amortized cost primarily due to our CLO investment portfolio, which is valued at a 69,429 discount to amortized cost.

 We may from time to time seek to cancel or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The amounts involved may be material. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including secured debt, unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such purchases or exchanges of outstanding debt would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. 
 
 Historically, we have funded a portion of our cash needs through borrowings from banks, issuances of senior securities, including secured, unsecured and convertible debt securities, or issuances of common equity. For flexibility, we maintain a universal shelf registration statement that allows for the public offering and sale of our debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, subscription rights, and warrants and units to purchase such securities up to an indeterminate amount. We may from time to time issue securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement or otherwise pursuant to private offerings. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful.

 On May 15, 2007, we formed our wholly owned subsidiary, PCF, a Delaware limited liability company and a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which holds certain of our portfolio loan investments that are used as collateral for the revolving credit facility at PCF.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the change in NAV was primarily due to net realized and unrealized losses of 227,789 , or 0.53 per basic weighted average share, and 0.08 of dilution per common share related to issuances of common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan and through conversion of Preferred Stock, as applicable. Additionally, distributions to common and preferred stockholders of 104,515 , or 0.24 per basic weighted average common share, exceeded net investment income of 89,877 , or 0.21 per basic weighted average common share, resulting in a net decrease of 0.03 per basic weighted average common share. The following table shows the calculation of net asset value per common share as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:

Results of Operations 
 Operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Investment income 196,308 236,245 Operating expenses 106,431 110,633 Net investment income 89,877 125,612 Net realized gains (losses) from investments (100,370) (207,489) Net change in unrealized gains (losses) from investments (123,767) 198,629 Net realized gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt 248 (91) Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations (134,012) 116,661 Preferred stock dividend (27,157) (23,151) Net gain (loss) on redemptions of preferred stock 2,304 501 Gain (loss) on Accretion to Redemption Value of Preferred Stock (6,204) Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations applicable to Common Stockholders (165,069) 94,011 
 While we seek to maximize gains and minimize losses, our investments in portfolio companies can expose our capital to risks greater than those we may anticipate. These companies typically do not issue securities rated investment grade, and have limited resources, limited operating history, and concentrated product lines or customers. These are generally private companies with limited operating information available and are likely to depend on a small core of management talents. Changes in any of these factors can have a significant impact on the value of the portfolio company. These changes, along with those discussed in Investment Valuation above, can cause significant fluctuations in our net change in unrealized gains (losses) from investments, and therefore our net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations applicable to common stockholders, quarter over quarter. 

Investment Income 
 We generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we own, dividend income on any common or preferred stock that we own, and fees generated from the structuring of new deals. Our investments, if in the form of debt securities, will typically have a term of one to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. To the extent achievable, we will seek to collateralize our investments by obtaining security interests in our portfolio companies assets. We also may acquire minority or majority equity interests in our portfolio companies, which may pay cash or in-kind dividends on a recurring or otherwise negotiated basis. In addition, we may generate revenue in other forms including prepayment penalties and possibly consulting fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments are recognized as earned. 
 Investment income consists of interest income, including accretion of loan origination fees and prepayment penalty fees, dividend income and other income, including settlement of net profits interests, overriding royalty interests and structuring fees.

The following table describes the various components of investment income and the related levels of debt investments: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Interest income 184,615 202,447 Dividend income 2,410 3,059 Other income 9,283 30,739 Total investment income 196,308 236,245 Average debt principal of performing interest bearing investments (1)

 9.45 10.22 
 (1) Excludes equity investments and non-accrual loans. 
 (2) Excludes equity investments. 
 
 The average interest earned on interest bearing performing assets decreased to 10.04 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 11.04 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average interest rate earned on our performing interest bearing investments decreased by 1.00 due to a decrease in income from our structured credit investments to 4,179 from 16,687, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, in addition to a decrease in interest income due to repayments and originations at lower rates than our average existing portfolio yield of 177,989 from 184,255, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The average interest earned on all interest bearing assets decreased to 9.45 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.22 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average interest rate earned on all interest bearing investments decreased by 0.77 primarily due to a decrease in income from our structured credit investments of 4,179 from 16,687 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Investment income is also generated from dividends and other income which is less predictable than interest income. The following table describes dividend income earned for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Dividend income RGIS Services, LLC 141 1,307 NMMB, Inc. 147 Other 2,269 1,605 Total dividend income 2,410 3,059 
 
 127 

Other income is comprised of structuring fees, advisory fees, amendment fees, royalty interests, receipts for residual net profit and revenue interests, administrative agent fees and other miscellaneous and sundry cash receipts. The following table describes other income earned for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Structuring and amendment fees Druid City Infusion, LLC 1,379 National Property REIT Corp. 15,476 Julie Lindsey, Inc. 550 Other, net 865 365 Total structuring and amendment fees 2,244 16,391 Royalty, net profit and revenue interests National Property REIT Corp. 6,665 13,996 Other, net 174 171 Total royalty and net revenue interests 6,839 14,167 Administrative agent fees Other, net 200 181 Total administrative agent fees 200 181 Total other income 9,283 30,739 
 
 Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 21,456 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 14,147 decrease structuring and amendment fees and a 7,328 decrease in royalty and net revenue interests. 
 Income recognized from dividend income, prepayment premium from early repayments, structuring fees and amendment fees related to specific loan positions is considered to be non-recurring income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 4,654 and 19,604 of non-recurring income, respectively. The 14,950 decrease in nonrecurring income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the 14,147 decrease in structuring and amendment fees, a decrease of 649 in dividend income and a decrease of 154 in prepayment premium income. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses consist of investment advisory fees (base management and income incentive fees), borrowing costs, legal and professional fees, overhead-related expenses and other operating expenses. These expenses include our allocable portion of overhead under the Administration Agreement with Prospect Administration under which Prospect Administration provides administrative services and facilities for us. Our investment advisory fees compensate the Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions. 
 128 

The following table describes the various components of our operating expenses: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Base management fee 38,606 39,289 Income incentive fee 15,680 25,617 Interest and credit facility expenses 39,760 40,593 Allocation of overhead from Prospect Administration 5,708 2,113 Audit, compliance and tax related fees 1,720 1,017 Directors fees 150 135 Other general and administrative expenses 4,807 1,869 Total operating expenses 106,431 110,633 
 
 Total gross and net base management fee w as 38,606 and 39,289 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in total gross base management fee is directly related to an decrease in average total assets. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred 15,680 and 25,617 of income incentive fees, respectively. This decrease was driven by a corresponding decrease in pre-incentive fee net investment income (net of preferred stock dividends) to 78,400 from 128,078 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. No capital gains incentive fee has yet been incurred pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incur red 39,760 a nd 40,593, respectively, of interest and credit facility expenses related to our Revolving Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes (collectively, our Notes ). These expenses are related directly to the leveraging capacity put into place for each of those periods and the levels of indebtedness actually undertaken in those periods. 
 The table below describes the various expenses of our Notes and the related indicators of lev eraging capacity and indebtedness during these years: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Interest on borrowings 34,494 36,815 Amortization of deferred financing costs 2,248 1,843 Accretion of discount on unsecured debt 735 716 Facility commitment fees 2,283 1,219 Total interest and credit facility expenses 39,760 40,593 Average principal debt outstanding 2,558,175 2,697,175 Annualized weighted average stated interest rate on borrowings (1) 
 5.39 5.46 Annualized weighted average interest rate on borrowings (2) 
 6.22 6.02 
 (1) Includes only the stated interest expense. 
 (2) Includes the stated interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, accretion of discount on Convertible and Public Notes and commitment fees on the undrawn portion of our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 129 

Interest expen se was 34,494 and 36,815 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The weighted average stated interest rate on borrowings (excluding amortization, accretion and undrawn facility fees) was 5.39 and 5.46 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the average Revolving Credit Facility outstanding, offset by an increase in stated interest rates for Prospect Capital InterNotes . The weighted average interest rate on all borrowings was 6.22 and 6.02 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is primari ly due to an increase in the weighted average rate of the outstanding Prospect Capital InterNotes , partially offset by the maturity of the 2024 Notes and decreased average Revolving Credit Facility outstanding, resulting in 0.20 increase to the weighted average interest rate on borrowings. 
 The allocation of net overhead expense from Prospect Administration was 5,708 and 2,113 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Prospect Administration rec eived estimated payme nts of 186 and 3,468 directly from our portfolio companies, and certain funds managed by the Investment Adviser for legal and tax services during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We were given a cred it for these payments as a reduction of the administrative services cost payable by us to Prospect Administration. Had Prospect Administration not received these payments, Prospect Administration s charges for its administrative services would have increased by this amount. The increase in the allocated net overhead expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period is primarily due to a decrease in reimbursements from portfolio companies. 
 Total operating expenses, excluding investment advisory fees, interest and credit facility expenses, and allocation of overhead from Prospect Administration Other Operating Expenses ), net of any expense reimbursements, were 6,677 and 3,021 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in audit, compliance and tax related fees, legal fees, as well as other general and administrative expenses.

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, our operating activities provided 173,726 and provided 95,084 of cash, respectively. The 78,642 increase is primarily driven by a 195,747 increase in repayments, and a 3,128 increase in net reductions to Subordinated Structured Notes and related costs, offset by a 155,842 increase in originations, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. There were no investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Financing activities used 202,576 and used 121,823 of cash during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, which included dividend payments and distributions to common and preferred stockholders of 93,197 and 92,802, respectively. The 80,753 decrease is primarily driven by a 18,852 decrease in issuance of preferred stock and a 61,308 decrease in net debt issuances, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our primary uses of funds have been to continue to invest in portfolio companies, through both debt and equity investments, to repay outstanding borrowings and to make cash distributions to our stockholders. 
 
 Our primary sources of funds have historically been issuances of debt and common equity, and beginning with our year ended June 30, 2021, issuances of preferred equity. We have and may continue to fund a portion of our cash needs through repayments and opportunistic sales of our existing investment portfolio. We may also securitize a portion of our investments in unsecured or senior secured loans or other assets. Our objective is to put in place such borrowings in order to enable us to expand our portfolio. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed 355,000 and we made repayments totaling 602,565 under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was 547,231. As of September 30, 2024, we had, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, 155,759 outstanding on the Convertible Notes, 976,504 outstanding on the Public Notes and 594,222 outstanding on the Prospect Capital InterNotes (See Capitalization above). 
 Undrawn committed revolvers and delayed draw term loans to our portfolio companies incur commitment and unused fees ranging from 0.00 to 5.75 . As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we had 47,914 and 34,771, respectively, of undrawn revolver and delayed draw term loan commitments to our portfolio companies. The fair value of our undrawn committed revolvers and delayed draw term loans was zero as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, as they were all floating rate instruments that repriced frequently. 
 On February 10, 2023, we filed a registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-269714) that was effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act, and which replaced our previously effective registration statement on Form N-2 that had been filed on February 13, 2020 and which was also effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act. The registration statement permits us to issue, through one or more transactions, an indeterminate amount of securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, subscription rights to purchase our securities, warrants representing rights to purchase our securities or separately tradable units combining two or more of our securities.

Preferred Stock 
 On August 3, 2020, we entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with Preferred Capital Securities, LLC PCS ), as amended on June 9, 2022, October 7, 2022, February 10, 2023, and December 29, 2023, pursuant to which PCS has agreed to serve as the Company s agent, principal distributor and dealer manager for the Company s offering of up to 80,000,000 shares, par value 0.001 per share, of preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share. Such convertible preferred stock may be issued in multiple series, including the 5.50 Series A1 Preferred Stock Series A1 Preferred Stock ), the 5.50 Series M1 Preferred Stock Series M1 Preferred Stock ), the 5.50 Series M2 Preferred Stock Series M2 Preferred Stock ), the 6.50 Series A3 Preferred Stock Series A3 Preferred Stock ), and the 6.50 Series M3 Preferred Stock Series M3 Preferred Stock however as disclosed in the Supplement No. 1 dated September 6, 2024 to the Prospectus Supplement dated December 29, 2023, the Company is no longer offering the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series M1 Preferred Stock, the Series M2 Preferred Stock, the Series A3 Preferred Stock and the Series M3 Preferred Stock and, as a result, any additional preferred stock offered under this offering will be only in any combination of our Floating Rate Series A4 Preferred Stock Series A4 Preferred Stock and the Floating Rate Series M4 Preferred Stock Series M4 Preferred Stock , and together with the Series A4 Preferred Stock, the Floating Rate Preferred Stock ), which are not convertible. In connection with such offering, on August 3, 2020, June 9, 2022, October 11, 2022, February 10, 2023 and December 28, 2023 (two filings) we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland SDAT ), reclassifying and designating 120,000,000, 60,000,000, 120,000,000, 60,000,000, 160,000,000, and 40,000,000 shares, respectively, of the Company s authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock. 
 On October 30, 2020, and as amended on February 18, 2022, October 7, 2022, and February 10, 2023, we entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with InspereX LLC, pursuant to which InspereX LLC has agreed to serve as the Company s agent and dealer manager for the Company s offering of up to 10,000,000 shares, par value 0.001 per share, of preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share. Such preferred stock will initially be issued in multiple series, including the 5.50 Series AA1 Preferred Stock (the Series AA1 Preferred Stock ), the 5.50 Series MM1 Preferred Stock (the Series MM1 Preferred Stock ), the 6.50 Series AA2 Preferred Stock (the Series AA2 Preferred Stock ), and the 6.50 Series MM2 Preferred Stock (the Series MM2 Preferred Stock and together with the Series M1 Preferred Stock, the Series M2 Preferred Stock, the Series M3 Preferred Stock, and the Series MM1 Preferred Stock, the Series M Preferred Stock and the Series MM2 Preferred Stock, together with the Series AA2 Preferred Stock, the Series A3 Preferred Stock and the Series M3 Preferred Stock, the 6.50 Preferred Stock however as disclosed in the Supplement No. 2 dated September 6, 2024 to the Prospectus Supplement dated February 10, 2023, the Company is no longer offering the Series AA1 Preferred Stock, the Series MM1 Preferred Stock, the Series AA2 Preferred Stock and the Series MM2 Preferred Stock. On October 30, 2020, February 17, 2022, and October 11, 2022, we filed Articles Supplementary with the SDAT, reclassifying and designating an additional 80,000,000 shares of the Company s authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock. On May 19, 2021, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement with UBS Securities LLC, relating to the offer and sale of 187,000 shares, par value 0.001 per share, of 5.50 Series A2 Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share (the Series A2 Preferred Stock , and together with the Series A1 Preferred Stock, Series M1 Preferred Stock, Series M2 Preferred Stock, Series AA1 Preferred Stock, and Series MM1 Preferred Stock, the 5.50 Preferred Stock ). The issuance of the Series A2 Preferred Stock settled on May 26, 2021. In connection with such offering, on May 19, 2021, we filed Articles Supplementary with the SDAT, reclassifying and designating an additional 1,000,000 shares of the Company s authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock. 
 In connection with the offerings of the 5.50 Preferred Stock, the 6.50 Preferred Stock, and the Floating Rate Preferred Stock, we adopted and amended, respectively, a preferred stock dividend reinvestment plan (the Preferred Stock Plan or the Preferred Stock DRIP ), pursuant to which (i) holders of the Floating Rate Preferred Stock will have dividends on their Floating Rate Preferred Stock reinvested in additional shares of Floating Rate Preferred Stock at a price per share of 25.00, and (ii) holders of the 5.50 Preferred Stock and the 6.50 Preferred Stock will have dividends on their 5.50 Preferred Stock and 6.50 Preferred Stock automatically reinvested in additional shares of such 5.50 Preferred Stock and 6.50 Preferred Stock, at a price per share of 23.75 (95 of the stated value of 25.00 per share), if they elect. 
 
 At any time prior to the listing of the 5.50 Preferred Stock and the 6.50 Preferred Stock on a national securities exchange, shares of the 5.50 Preferred Stock and the 6.50 Preferred Stock are convertible, at the option of the holder of the 5.50 Preferred Stock and the 6.50 Preferred Stock (the Holder Optional Conversion ). We will settle any Holder Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price of shares of our common stock over each of the five consecutive trading days ending on the Holder Conversion Exercise Date (such arithmetic average, the 5-day VWAP ). For the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series A3 Preferred Stock, the Series AA1 Preferred Stock, the Series AA2 Preferred Stock and the Series A2 Preferred Stock, Settlement Amount means (A) 25.00 per share (the Stated Value ), plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, 
 133 

the Holder Conversion Exercise Date, minus (C) the applicable Holder Optional Conversion Fee for the respective Holder Conversion Deadline. For the Series M Preferred Stock, Settlement Amount means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Conversion Exercise Date, minus (C) the applicable Series M Clawback, if any. Series M Clawback , if applicable, means an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all dividends, whether paid or accrued, on such share of Series M Stock in the three full months prior to the Holder Conversion Exercise Date. Subject to certain limited exceptions, we will not pay any portion of the Settlement Amount in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50 Preferred Stock or 6.50 Preferred Stock has been issued. Beginning on the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50 Preferred Stock or 6.50 Preferred Stock is issued, we may elect to settle all or a portion of any Holder Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. The right of holders to convert a share of 5.50 Preferred Stock or 6.50 Preferred Stock will terminate upon the listing of such share on a national securities exchange. Shares of the Floating Rate Preferred Stock do not have a Holder Optional Conversion Feature. 
 Subject to certain limited exceptions allowing earlier redemption, beginning on the earlier of the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50 Preferred Stock or 6.50 Preferred Stock has been issued, or the two year anniversary of the date on which a share of Floating Rate Preferred Stock has been issued or, for listed shares of 5.50 Preferred Stock or 6.50 Preferred Stock, five years from the earliest date on which any series that has been listed was first issued and, for listed shares of Floating Rate Preferred Stock, two years from the earliest date on which any series that has been listed was first issued (the earlier of such dates as applicable to a series of Preferred Stock, the Redemption Eligibility Date ), such share of Preferred Stock may be redeemed at any time or from time to time at our option (the Issuer Optional Redemption ), at a redemption price of 100 of the Stated Value of the shares to be redeemed plus unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. 
 Shares of the Floating Rate Preferred Stock are redeemable, at the option of the holder of such Floating Rate Preferred Stock, on a monthly basis (the Holder Optional Redemption ). For all shares of Floating Rate Preferred Stock duly submitted for redemption on or before a monthly Holder Redemption Deadline (defined in the prospectus supplement dated December 29, 2023), the HOR Settlement Amount (as defined below) is determined on any business day after such Holder Redemption Deadline but before the Holder Redemption Deadline occurring two months thereafter (such date, the Holder Redemption Exercise Date ). Within such period, we may select the Holder Redemption Exercise Date in our sole discretion. We will settle any Holder Optional Redemption by paying the HOR Settlement Amount in cash. In addition, the aggregate amount of Holder Optional Redemptions by the holder of Floating Rate Preferred Stock is subject to the following redemption limits: (i) no more than 2 of the outstanding Floating Rate Preferred Stock, in aggregate, as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter will be redeemed per calendar month; (ii) no more than 5 of the outstanding Floating Rate Preferred Stock, in aggregate, as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter will be redeemed per fiscal quarter and (iii) no more than 20 of the outstanding Floating Rate Preferred Stock, in aggregate, as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter will be redeemed per Annual Redemption Period. An Annual Redemption Period means our then current fiscal quarter and the three fiscal quarters immediately preceding our then current fiscal quarter. A share of Series A4 Preferred Stock is subject to an early redemption fee if it is redeemed by its holder within five years of issuance. Redemption capacity of the Floating Rate Preferred Stock will be allocated on a pro rata basis based on the number of shares of Floating Rate Preferred Stock, as applicable, submitted in the event that a monthly redemption is oversubscribed, based on any of the foregoing redemption limits. We may waive the foregoing redemption limits in our sole discretion at any time. 
 For the Series A4 Preferred Stock, HOR Settlement Amount means (A) the stated value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Redemption Exercise Date, minus (C) the Series A4 Preferred Stock Holder Optional Redemption fee applicable on the respective Holder Redemption Deadline. 
 For the Series M4 Preferred Stock, HOR Settlement Amount means (A) the stated value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Redemption Exercise Date, but if a holder of Series M4 Preferred Stock exercises a Holder Optional Redemption within the first twenty-four months of issuance of such Series M4 Preferred Stock, the HOR Settlement Amount payable to such holder will be reduced by (i) during the first twelve months of issuance of such Series M4 Preferred Stock, the aggregate amount of all dividends, whether paid or accrued, on such Series M4 Preferred Stock in the six-month period prior to the Holder Redemption Exercise Date, and (ii) during the second twelve months of issuance of such Series M4 Preferred Stock, the aggregate amount of all dividends, whether paid or accrued, on such Series M4 Preferred Stock in the three-month period prior to the Holder Redemption Exercise Date (such amount, the Series M4 Shares Clawback ). We are permitted to waive the Series M4 Shares Clawback through public announcement of the terms and duration of such waiver. Any such waiver would apply to any holder of Preferred Stock qualifying for the waiver and exercising a Holder Optional Redemption during the pendency of the term of such waiver. Although we have retained the right to waive the Series M4 Shares Clawback in the manner described above, we are not required to establish any such waivers and we may never establish any such waivers. 
 134 

Subject to certain limitations, each share of 5.50 Preferred Stock or 6.50 Preferred Stock may be converted at our option (the Issuer Optional Conversion ). We will settle any Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the 5-day VWAP, subject to our ability to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value if the 5-day VWAP represents a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock. For the 5.50 Preferred Stock and 6.50 Preferred Stock, IOC Settlement Amount means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for conversion. In connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value. If we do not have or obtain any required stockholder approval under the 1940 Act to sell our common stock below net asset value and the 5-day VWAP is at a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock, we will settle any conversions in connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the NAV per share of common stock at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of conversion. We will not pay any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount from an Issuer Optional Conversion in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the Redemption Eligibility Date. Beginning on the Redemption Eligibility Date, we may elect to settle any Issuer Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. In the event that we exercise an Issuer Optional Conversion with respect to any shares of 5.50 Preferred Stock or 6.50 Preferred Stock, the holder of such 5.50 Preferred Stock or 6.50 Preferred Stock may instead elect a Holder Optional Conversion with respect to such 5.50 Preferred Stock or 6.50 Preferred Stock provided that the date of conversion for such Holder Optional Conversion would occur prior to the date of conversion for an Issuer Optional Conversion. Shares of the Floating Rate Preferred Stock do not have an Issuer Optional Conversion feature. The Company actively manages its offerings of preferred stock and, although it may or may not be presently offering a particular series of its preferred stock, the Company may determine to issue any of its authorized series of preferred stock (and, in connection therewith, to relaunch the offering of any particular series, if previously terminated) based on its assessment of market conditions, demand, and appropriate cost of capital in light of the foregoing and the overall construction of its portfolio and capital structure. 
 On July 12, 2021, we entered into an underwriting agreement by and among us, Prospect Capital Management L.P., Prospect Administration LLC, and Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the underwriters, relating to the offer and sale of 6,000,000 shares, or 150,000 in aggregate liquidation preference, of our 5.35 Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value 0.001 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock or 5.35 Preferred Stock ), at a public offering price of 25.00 per share. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock solely to cover over-allotments. The offer settled on July 19, 2021, and no additional shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were issued pursuant to the option. In connection with such offering, on July 15, 2021, we filed Articles Supplementary with SDAT, reclassifying and designating 6,900,000 shares of the Company s authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock into shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 
 Each series of 5.50 Preferred Stock, 6.50 Preferred Stock, Floating Rate Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock ranks (with respect to the payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) (a) senior to our common stock, (b) on parity with each other series of our preferred stock, and (c) junior to our existing and future secured and unsecured indebtedness . See Note 8, Fair Value and Maturity of Debt Outstanding for further discussion on our senior securities. 
 We may from time to time seek to cancel or purchase our outstanding preferred stock through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The amounts involved may be material. Any such purchases or exchanges of preferred stock would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. On June 16, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1.5 million shares our Series A Preferred Stock and further on October 11, 2023, authorized any and all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock to be repurchased. The manner, price, volume and timing of preferred share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 62,309 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for a total cost of approximately 1,001, including fees and commissions paid to the broker, representing an average repurchase price of 15.88 per share. The difference in the consideration transferred and the net carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock repurchased, which was 1,469, resulted in a gain applicable to common stock holders of approximately 501 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The repurchased shares reverted to authorized but unissued shares of Series A Preferred Stock and thus the Company holds no treasury stock. 
 135 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we exchanged an aggregate of 87,433 Series M1 Preferred Stock for an aggregate of 5,842 and 81,589 newly-issued Series M3 Preferred Stock and Series M4 Preferred Stock, respectively, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we exchanged an aggregate of 131,917 Series M3 Preferred Stock for an aggregate of 131,914 newly-issued Series M4 Preferred Stock pursuant to the Securities Act. 
 The Series M3 Preferred Stock and Series M4 Preferred Stock issued in the exchanges were issued in each case to an existing security holder of the Company exclusively in exchange for such holder s securities. No commission or other remuneration was paid or given for soliciting the exchange. Stockholders who exchange Series M1 Preferred Stock for Series M3 Preferred Stock or Series M4 Preferred Stock or Series M3 Preferred Stock for Series M4 Preferred Stock will receive unpaid dividends on their Series M1 Preferred Stock or Series M3 Preferred Stock accrued to, but not including, the Exchange Exercise Date, plus any fractional amount of a Series M1 Preferred Stock or Series M3 Preferred Stock exchanged multiplied by 25.00 in cash. Upon settlement, the carrying amount (including any premiums or discounts and a proportional amount of any issuance costs) of the Series M1 Preferred Stock or Series M3 Preferred Stock are reclassified to Series M3 Preferred Stock or Series M4 Preferred stock , respectively, with no gain or loss recognized . 
 Subject to certain limited exceptions allowing earlier redemption, at any time after the close of business on July 19, 2026 (any such date, an Optional Redemption Date ), at our sole option, we may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in whole or, from time to time, in part, out of funds legally available for such redemption, at a price per share equal to the liquidation preference of 25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends on such shares (whether or not earned or declared, but excluding interest thereon) accumulated up to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption. We may also redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or, from time to time, in part, including prior to the Optional Redemption Date, pro rata, based on liquidation preference, with all other series of our then outstanding preferred stock, in the event that our Board of Directors determines to redeem any series of our preferred stock, in whole or, from time to time, in part, because such redemption is deemed necessary by our Board of Directors to comply with the asset coverage requirements of the 1940 Act or for us to maintain RIC status. 
 In the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below), we may, at our option, exercise our special optional redemption right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred by paying the liquidation preference, plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends on such shares (whether or not earned or declared, but excluding interest thereon) accumulated up to, but excluding, the date fixed for such redemption. To the extent that we exercise our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right relating to the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will not be permitted to exercise the conversion right described below in respect of their shares called for redemption. 
 Except to the extent that we have elected to exercise our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right by providing notice of redemption prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined below), upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to convert some or all of the Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of our shares of common stock per Series A Preferred Stock to be converted equal to the lesser of: 
 the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of the Liquidation Preference per share plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not earned or declared, but excluding interest thereon) accumulated up to, but excluding, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Record Date for a Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment and prior to the corresponding Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in this sum) by (ii) the Common Stock Price (as defined below); and 
 6.03865, subject to certain adjustments, 
 subject, in each case, to provisions for the receipt of alternative consideration upon conversion as described in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
 If we have provided or provide a redemption notice with respect to some or all of the Series A Preferred Stock, holders of any Series A Preferred Stock that we have called for redemption will not be permitted to exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right in respect of any of their Series A Preferred Stock that have been called for redemption, and any Series A Preferred Stock subsequently called for redemption that have been tendered for conversion will be redeemed on the applicable date of redemption instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. 
 For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a redemption upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, the following definitions are applicable: 
 Change of Control Triggering Event means the occurrence of any of the following: 
 136 

the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation and other than an Excluded Transaction) in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Controlled Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any person or group (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than to any Permitted Holders); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, a pledge of assets pursuant to any of our secured debt instruments or the secured debt instruments of our Controlled Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be any such sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or disposition; or 
 the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation and other than an Excluded Transaction) the result of which is that any person or group (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than any Permitted Holders) becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50 of our outstanding Voting Stock, measured by voting power rather than number of shares. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the consummation of any of the transactions referred to in the bullet points above will not be deemed a Change of Control Triggering Event if we or the acquiring or surviving consolidated entity has or continues to have a class of common securities (or ADRs representing such securities) listed on the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ, or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ, or is otherwise listed or quoted on a national securities exchange. 
 The Change of Control Conversion Date is the date the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be converted, which will be a business day selected by us that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which we provide the notice described above to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock. 
 The Common Stock Price will be (i) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control Triggering Event by the holders of our common stock is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of our common stock or (ii) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control Triggering Event by holders of our common stock is other than solely cash (x) the average of the closing sale prices per share of our common stock (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the closing bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask prices) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Change of Control Triggering Event as reported on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which our common stock is then traded, or (y) the average of the last quoted bid prices for our common stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by OTC Markets Group Inc. or similar organization for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Change of Control Triggering Event, if our common stock is not then listed for trading on a U.S. securities exchange. 
 Controlled Subsidiary means any of our subsidiaries, 50 or more of the outstanding equity interests of which are owned by us and our direct or indirect subsidiaries and of which we possess, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies, whether through the ownership of voting equity interests, by agreement or otherwise. 
 Excluded Transaction means (i) any transaction that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of all or substantially all of the outstanding shares of our Voting Stock; (ii) any changes resulting from a subdivision or combination or a change solely in par value; (iii) any transaction where the shares of our Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving person (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) or any direct or indirect parent company of the surviving person (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) immediately after giving effect to such transaction; (iv) any transaction if (A) we become a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (B)(1) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of our Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (2) immediately following that transaction no person (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 of the Voting Stock of such holding company; or (v) any transaction primarily for the purpose of changing our jurisdiction of incorporation or form of organization. 
 Permitted Holders means (i) us, (ii) one or more of our Controlled Subsidiaries and (iii) Prospect Capital Management or any affiliate of Prospect Capital Management that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction located in the United States of America and in the business of managing or advising clients.

 137 

Except as provided above in connection with a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or property. 
 For so long as the Series A Preferred Stock and the Floating Rate Preferred Stock are outstanding, we will not exercise any option we have to convert any other series of our outstanding preferred stock to common stock, including the Issuer Optional Conversion, or any other security ranking junior to such preferred stock. As a result, if dividends on the Preferred Stock have accumulated and been unpaid for a period of two years, a possibility of redemption outside of the Company s control exists and, in accordance with ASC 480, we have presented our 5.50 Preferred Stock, 6.50 Preferred Stock, and Series A Preferred Stock within temporary equity on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 
 The Floating Rate Preferred Stock is redeemable at the election of the Holder at any time; therefore, is probable of redemption outside of the Company s control. As a result, the Floating Rate Preferred Stock is classified within temporary equity on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and is accreted to redemption value upon issuance. Accretion to redemption value is treated as an adjustment to net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations applicable to common stockholders on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 We determined the estimated value as of September 30, 2024 of our 5.50 Preferred Stock, 6.50 Preferred Stock and Floating Rate Preferred Stock with a 25.00 stated value per share. We engaged a third-party valuation service to assist in our determination based on the calculation resulting from the total equity on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the Form 10-Q ), which was prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, adjusted for the fair value of our investments (i.e. from our Consolidated Schedule of Investments and total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of our Preferred Stock outstanding. Based on this methodology and because the result from the calculation above is greater than the 25.00 per share stated value of our 5.50 Preferred Stock, 6.50 Preferred Stock and Floating Rate Preferred Stock, the estimated value of our 5.50 Preferred Stock, 6.50 Preferred Stock and Floating Rate Preferred Stock as of September 30, 2024 is 25.00 per share. 
 Common Stock 
 Our common stockholders equity accounts as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 reflect cumulative shares issued, net of shares previously repurchased, as of those respective dates. Our common stock has been issued through public offerings, a registered direct offering, the exercise of over-allotment options on the part of the underwriters, our common stock dividend reinvestment plan in connection with the acquisition of certain controlled portfolio companies and in connection with our 5.50 and 6.50 Preferred Stock Holder Optional Conversion and Optional Redemptions Following Death of a Holder. When our common stock is issued, the related offering expenses have been charged against paid-in capital in excess of par. All underwriting fees and offering expenses were borne by us. 
 We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the Repurchase Program is 65,860. 
 On June 10, 2024, at a special meeting of stockholders, our stockholders authorized us to sell shares of our common stock (during the next 12 months) at a price or prices below our net asset value per share at the time of sale in one or more offerings, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the proxy statement relating to the special meeting (including that the number of shares sold on any given date does not exceed 25 of its outstanding common stock immediately prior to such sale).

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We prepare our Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. These estimates, however, are subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ materially from our current estimates due to the inherent nature of these estimates. 
 Our critical accounting estimates, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with our risk factors as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on how fair value of our investment portfolio is determined, and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the inputs and assumptions used to measure fair value of our investment portfolio. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 To value our investments, we follow the guidance of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ), that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in conformity with GAAP, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC 820, the fair value of our investments is defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that investment is transacted. 
 ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy: 
 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. 
 Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices. 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
 In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. All of our investments carried at fair value are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 , with a significant portion of our investments classified as Level 3. 
 Investments 
 We determine the fair value of our investments on a quarterly basis, with changes in fair value reflected as a net change in unrealized gains (losses) from investments in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 140 

The Company applies the SEC s Rule 2a-5 in determining fair value of its investments. Rule 2a-5 establishes a consistent, principles-based framework for boards of directors to use in creating their own specific processes in order to determine fair values in good faith. 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, management and the independent valuation firm look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. In determining the range of values for debt and equity instruments where market quotations are not readily available, we perform a multiple step valuation process with our investment professionals alongside our independent valuation firms. The independent valuation firms prepare valuations for each investment which are presented by the independent valuation firms to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to the Board of Directors of the value for each investment and the Board of Directors approves the values with the input of the Investment Adviser. 
 Management and the independent valuation firms may consider various factors in determining the fair value of our investments. One prominent factor is the enterprise value of a portfolio company determined by applying a market approach such as using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA multiples, net income and/or book value multiples for similar guideline public companies and/or similar recent investment transactions and/or an income approach, such as the discounted cash flow technique. If relevant, management and the independent valuation firms will consider the pricing indicated by external events such as a purchase or sale transaction to corroborate the valuation. 
 Changes in market yields, discount rates, capitalization rates or EBITDA multiples, each in isolation, may change the fair value measurement of certain of our investments. Generally, an increase in market yields, discount rates or capitalization rates, or a decrease in EBITDA (or other) multiples may result in a decrease in the fair value measurement of certain of our investments. 
 Our investments that are classified as Level 3 are primarily valued utilizing a discounted cash flow, enterprise value EV waterfall, or asset recovery analysis. The discounted cash flow converts future cash flows or earnings to a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived utilizing an appropriate discount rate. The fair value measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. Under the EV waterfall, the EV of a portfolio company is first determined and allocated over the portfolio company s securities in order of their preference relative to one another (i.e., waterfall allocation). To determine the EV, we typically use a market (multiples) valuation approach that considers relevant and applicable market trading data of guideline public companies, transaction metrics from precedent merger and acquisitions transactions, and/or a discounted cash flow . The asset recovery analysis is intended to approximate the net recovery value of an investment based on, among other things, assumptions regarding liquidation proceeds based on a hypothetical liquidation of a portfolio company s assets. 
 In determining the range of values for our investments in CLOs, the independent valuation firm uses a discounted multi-path cash flow model. Various risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows for the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market and certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. 
 At September 30, 2024, 4,638,522, 2,775,389, and 22,669 of our total investments were valued using the discounted cash flow, enterprise value waterfall, and asset recovery analysis, respectively, compared to 4,798,675, 2,846,887, and 22,940, respectively, at June 30, 2024. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the currently assigned valuations.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and equity price risk. Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of heightened interest rates in response to inflation, conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the Israel-Hamas war and the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility could materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. Concerning these risks and their potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Risks Relating to our Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates impacting some of the loans in our portfolio which have floating interest rates. Additionally, because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Risks Relating to our Business - Changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Our debt investments may be based on floating rates or fixed rates. For our floating rate loans the rates are determined from the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), EURO Interbank Offer Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. The floating interest rate loans may be subject to a SOFR floor. Our loans typically have durations of one, three or six months after which they reset to current market interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 80.96 of the interest earning investments in our portfolio, at fair value, bore interest at floating rates. 
 We also have a revolving credit facility and Floating Rate Preferred Stock that pay interest and monthly dividends, respectively, based on floating SOFR rates. Interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is one-month SOFR plus 205 basis points with no minimum SOFR floor and there is 547,231 of outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024. Dividends for the Floating Rate Preferred Stock are equal to one-month Term SOFR (which will reset upon each dividend declaration by our Board of Directors) plus 2.00 , subject to a minimum and maximum annualized dividend rate of 6.50 and 8.00 , respectively. There a re 7,648,950 s hares of the Floating Rate Preferred Stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024. See Note 9. Equity Offerings, Offering Expenses, and Distributions for further discussion on our Floating Rate Preferred Stock. The Convertible Notes, Public Notes, Prospect Capital InterNotes and remaining Preferred Stock bear interest at fixed rates. 
 
 The following table shows the approximate annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate flows for floating rate instruments, excluding our investments in Subordinated Structured Notes) to our loan portfolio and outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024, assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

 (2) Includes the impact of the Floating Rate Preferred Stock dividend. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 the one, three, and six month SOFR were 4.85 , 4.59 , and 4.25 respectively . 
 
 We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of higher interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. During the period ended September 30, 2024, we did not engage in hedging activities. 
 142 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Pursuant to SEC regulations, this table is calculated as of September 30, 2024. As a result, it has not been updated to take into account any changes in assets or leverage since September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On August 24, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the Repurchase Program ), pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 100,000 of our common stock at prices below our net asset value per share. Prior to any repurchase, we are required to notify stockholders of our intention to purchase our common stock. 
 We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the plan is 65.9 million. 
 On June 16, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1.5 million shares our Series A Preferred Stock and further on October 11, 2023, authorized any and all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock to be repurchased. The manner, price, volume and timing of preferred share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. There were no repurchases during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we exchanged an aggregate of 87,433 Series M1 Preferred Stock for an aggregate of 5,842 and 81,589 newly-issued Series M3 Preferred Stock and Series M4 Preferred Stock, respectively, pursuant 
 146 

to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we exchanged an aggregate of 131,917 Series M3 Preferred Stock for an aggregate of 131,914 newly-issued Series M4 Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. Section 3(a)(9) provides that the registration requirements of the Securities Act will not apply to any security exchanged by the issuer with its existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange. We have no contract, arrangement or understanding relating to, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay any commission or other remuneration to any broker, dealer, salesperson, agent or any other person for soliciting exchanges in the exchange offer. 
 The shares of Series M3 Preferred Stock and Series M4 Preferred Stock issued in the exchange were issued in each case to an existing security holder of the Company, along with cash in respect of accrued but unpaid dividends on the exchanged securities, plus any fractional amount of a Series M1 Preferred Stock or Series M3 Preferred Stock exchanged multiplied by 25.00 in cash, exclusively in exchange for such holder s securities and no commission or other remuneration was paid or given for soliciting the exchange. The Series M1 Preferred Stock and Series M3 Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holder. See Note 9 for further discussion of the features of the Series M1 Preferred Stock, Series M3 Preferred Stock and Series M4 Preferred Stock. Other exceptions may apply.

Recent Sales of Common Stock Below Net Asset Value 
 At our 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, and at special meetings of stockholders held on June 12, 2020, June 11, 2021, June 10, 2022, June 9, 2023, and June 10, 2024 our stockholders approved our ability to sell shares of our common stock at a price or prices below our NAV per common share at the time of sale in one or more offerings. The current approval to sell shares of our common stock below our NAV per common share is valid until June 10, 2025 and subject to certain conditions as set forth in the proxy statement relating to the special meeting (including that the number of shares sold on any given date does not exceed 25 of our outstanding common stock immediately prior to such sale). Accordingly, we may make offerings of our common stock without any limitation on the total amount of dilution to stockholders. Our prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus relating to this offering contains additional information about these offerings. Pursuant to the authority granted by our stockholders and the approval of our Board of Directors, we have made the following offerings below NAV per common share: 
 Date of Offering Price Per Share to Investors Shares Issued Estimated Net Asset Value per Common Share(1) Percentage Dilution June 15, 2020 to June 22, 2020(2) 5.29 - 5.40 1,158,222 7.93 - 7.94 0.10 
 (1) The data for sales of common shares below NAV pursuant to our equity distribution agreements are estimates based on our last reported NAV prior to the respective period adjusted for capital events occurring during the period since the last calculated NAV. All amounts presented are approximations based on the best available data at the time of issuance. 
 (2) At the market offering. Dates of offering represent the sales dates of the stock. The settlement dates are two business days later than the sale dates.

Ongoing Preferred Stock Offerings (1) - You would pay the following expenses on a 1,000 investment in shares of our common stock, assuming a 5 annual return on our portfolio 
 249 528 735 1,049 
 (1) Represents the highest level of expenses from all ongoing Preferred Stock offerings referenced in the Fee and Expenses table above, assuming a maximum number of shares of Preferred Stock presently offered in each offering is sold. Presently a maximum of 90 million shares of Series A4 Preferred Stock and Series M4 Preferred Stock may be sold. As of September 30, 2024, there are 28,266,559, 164,000, 24,608,472, 5,801,035, 1,409,007, 3,025,020, 1,847,915 and 5,251,157 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock, Series A2 Preferred Stock, Series A3 Preferred Stock, Series A4 Preferred Stock, Series M1 Preferred Stock, Series M3 Preferred Stock, Series M4 Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, outstanding. This table reflects the sales load paid on the Preferred Stock, which common stockholders will not be subject to, unless common stockholders purchased shares of the Series A1 Preferred Stock, Series A2 Preferred Stock, Series A3 Preferred Stock, Series M1 Preferred Stock, Series M2 Preferred Stock, and/or Series M3 Preferred Stock and converted such shares into common stock. 
 
 Assumes that we will not realize any capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on our portfolio. 
 Assumes no unrealized capital depreciation or realized capital losses and 5 annual return on our portfolio resulting entirely from net realized capital gains (and therefore subject to the capital gains incentive fee). 
 While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5 annual return on our portfolio, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5 . The income incentive fee under our Investment Advisory Agreement with Prospect Capital Management is unlikely to be material assuming a 5 annual return on our portfolio and is not included in the example. If we achieve sufficient returns on our portfolio, including through the realization of capital gains, to trigger an incentive fee of a material amount, our distributions to our common stockholders and our expenses would likely be higher. In addition, while the example assumes reinvestment of all dividends and other distributions at NAV, common stockholders that participate in our common stock dividend reinvestment plan will receive a number of shares of our common stock determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to a participant by 95 of the market price per share of our common stock at the close of trading on the valuation date for the distribution. 
 This example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses. Actual expenses (including the cost of debt, if any, and other expenses) may be greater or less than those shown. 
 
 (1) Includes up to a 7.0 selling commission on the 25.00 per share (the Stated Value paid by the Company and a dealer manager fee equal to 3.0 of the Stated Value paid by the Company. Reductions in selling commissions will be reflected in reduced public offering prices as described in the Plan of Distribution section of this prospectus supplement and the net proceeds to us will generally not be impacted by such reductions; therefore, we will bear a reduction in net proceeds to us up to 7.0 of the Stated Value on all Series A4 Shares although the selling commission compensation paid by us to our dealer manager may represent less than 7.0 of the Stated Value. We may, through the Holder Optional Redemption Fee applicable to holders of the Series A4 Shares, effectively recoup a portion of the Sales Load if stockholders exercise a Holder Optional Redemption of their Series A4 shares prior to the 5-year anniversary of the original issue date. The Holder Optional Redemption Fee is 10.00 of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein prior to the third anniversary of the issuance of such Series A4 Shares, 8.00 of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein on or after the third anniversary but prior to the fourth anniversary, 5.00 of the maximum public offering price disclosed herein on or after the fourth anniversary but prior to the fifth anniversary and 0.00 on or after the fifth anniversary. 
 
 (2) Includes a dealer manager fee equal to 3.0 of the Stated Value paid by the Company. 
 
 (3) The selling commission and dealer manager fee, when combined with organization and offering expenses (including due diligence expenses and fees for establishing servicing arrangements for new stockholder accounts), are not expected to exceed 11.5 of the gross offering proceeds. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, authorize the Company to incur underwriting and other offering expenses in excess of 11.5 of the gross offering proceeds. In no event will the combined selling commission, dealer manager fee and offering expenses exceed FINRA s limit on underwriting and other offering expenses. 
 
 151 

(6) Based on our net investment income and realized capital gains, less realized and unrealized capital losses, earned on our portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024, all of which consisted of an income incentive fee. This historical amount has been adjusted to reflect the issuance of 96,187,000 shares of combined 5.50 Preferred Stock, 6.50 Preferred Stock, and Floating Rate Preferred Stock. The capital gain incentive fee is paid without regard to pre-incentive fee income. For a more detailed discussion of the calculation of the two-part incentive fee, see Management Services-Investment Advisory Agreement in the applicable prospectus. 
 
 (7) As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.7 billion outstanding of Unsecured Notes (as defined below) in various maturities, ranging from February 15, 2025 to March 15, 2052, and interest rates, ranging from 2.25 to 8.00 , some of which are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at various conversion rates. 
 
 (8) 
 
 (9) If all 57,473,059 shares of combined 5.50 Preferred Stock and 6.50 Preferred Stock were converted into common stock and assuming all the Series A1, Series A3, and Series AA2 Preferred Stock pay a Holder Optional Conversion Fee of 9.00 and all the Series A2 Preferred Stock pay a Holder Optional Conversion Fee of 7.50 of the maximum public offering price disclosed within the applicable prospectus supplement and are converted at a conversion rate based on the 5-day VWAP of our common stock on September 30, 2024, which was 5.36, then management fees would be 3.92 , incentive fees payable under our Investment Advisory Agreement would be 1.32 , total advisory fees would be 5.24 , total interest expenses would be 4.82 , other expenses would be 1.00 , and total annual expenses would be 11.06 of net assets attributable to our common stock. The actual 5-day VWAP of our common stock on a conversion date may be more or less than 5.36, which may result in fees that are higher or lower than those described herein. These figures are based on the same assumptions described in the other notes to this fee table. 
 
 (10) Based on the 5.50 per annum dividend rate applicable to the A1 Shares, M1 Shares, M2 Shares, AA1 Shares, MM1 Shares, and A2 Shares. Also based on the 5.35 per annum dividend rate applicable to the A Shares. Also based on the 6.50 per annum dividend rate applicable to the A3 Shares, M3 Shares, AA2 Shares, and MM2 Shares. Also based on the 6.65 annualized dividend rate applicable to A4 Shares and M4 Shares based on the floating rate as of November 1, 2024. Other series of preferred stock, including other series of preferred stock being sold in different offerings, may bear different annual dividend rates. No dividend will be paid on shares of Preferred Stock after they have been converted to shares of common stock. 
 
 (11) The indirect expenses associated with the Company s investments in collateralized loan obligations are not included in the fee table presentation, but if such expenses were included in the fee table presentation then the Company s total annual expenses would have been 16.04 , or 20.07 after dividends on Preferred Stock.
