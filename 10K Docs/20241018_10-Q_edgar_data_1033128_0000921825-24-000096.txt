EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 of First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), and First Industrial, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"). Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "our" and "us" refer to the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 The Company is a real estate investment trust and the general partner of the Operating Partnership. At September 30, 2024, the Company owned an approximate 97.3 common general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining approximate 2.7 common limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are owned by limited partners. The limited partners of the Operating Partnership primarily include persons or entities who contributed their direct or indirect interests in properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and recipients of RLP Units (as defined in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) of the Operating Partnership pursuant to the Company's stock incentive plan. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company exercises exclusive and complete discretion over the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control and can cause it to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions and refinancings. The management of the Company consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. 
 The Company and the Operating Partnership are managed and operated as one enterprise. The financial results of the Operating Partnership are consolidated into the financial statements of the Company. The Company has no significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Substantially all of the Company's assets are held by, and its operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Company and the Operating Partnership are substantially the same. 
 We believe it is important to understand the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how the Company and the Operating Partnership operate as an interrelated, consolidated company. The main areas of difference between the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership are: 
 Equity, Noncontrolling Interest and Partners' Capital. The 2.7 equity interest in the Operating Partnership held by persons or entities other than the Company is classified as limited partners units in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and as a noncontrolling interest in the Company's financial statements. 
 Relationship to Other Real Estate Partnerships. The Company's operations are conducted primarily through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, although operations are also conducted through several other limited partnerships, which are referred to as the "Other Real Estate Partnerships." The Operating Partnership is a limited partner, holding at least a 99 interest, and the Company is a general partner, holding at least a .01 general partnership interest through several separate wholly-owned corporations, in each of the Other Real Estate Partnerships. The Other Real Estate Partnerships are variable interest entities that both the Company and the Operating Partnership consolidate. The Company's direct general partnership interest in the Other Real Estate Partnerships is reflected as noncontrolling interest within the Operating Partnership's financial statements. 
 Relationship to Service Subsidiary. The Company has a direct wholly-owned subsidiary that does not own any real estate but provides services to various other entities owned by the Company. Since the Operating Partnership does not have an ownership interest in this entity, its operations are reflected in the consolidated results of the Company but not the Operating Partnership. Also, this entity owes certain amounts to the Operating Partnership, for which a receivable is included on the Operating Partnership's balance sheet but is eliminated on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet, since both this entity and the Operating Partnership are fully consolidated by the Company. 
 We believe combining the Company's and Operating Partnership's quarterly reports into this single report results in the following benefits: 
 enhances investors' understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole and in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports; and 
 eliminates duplicative disclosures and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the Company's disclosure applies to both the Company and the Operating Partnership. 

To help investors understand the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report provides the following disclosures for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership: 
 Consolidated Financial Statements; 
 a single set of consolidated notes to such financial statements that includes separate discussions of each entity's equity or partners' capital, as applicable; and 
 a combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that includes distinct information related to each entity. 
 This report also includes separate Part I, Item 4, Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for the Company and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that the Company and the Operating Partnership are both compliant with Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and 18 U.S.C. 1350.

 Our Unsecured Credit Facility, our Unsecured Term Loans, our senior notes issued in private placements ("Private Placement Notes") and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain certain financial covenants, including limitations on incurrence of debt and debt service coverage. Under the Unsecured Credit Facility and the Unsecured Term Loans, an event of default can occur if the lenders, in their good faith judgment, determine that a material adverse change has occurred, which could prevent timely repayment or materially impair our ability to perform our obligations under the loan agreements. We believe the Operating Partnership and the Company were in compliance with all covenants relating to the Unsecured Credit Facility, the Unsecured Term Loans, the Private Placement Notes and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes as of September 30, 2024; however, these financial covenants are complex and there can be no assurance that these provisions would not be interpreted by our lenders and noteholders in a manner that could impose and cause us to incur material costs.

 _______________ 
 (A) 
 The fair value of our mortgage loan payable was determined by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made based upon similar remaining maturities. The current market rate we utilized was internally estimated. The fair value of the senior unsecured notes was determined by using rates, as advised by our bankers, that are based upon recent trades within the same series of the senior unsecured notes, recent trades for senior unsecured notes with comparable maturities, recent trades for fixed rate unsecured notes from companies with profiles similar to ours, as well as overall economic conditions. The fair value of the Unsecured Credit Facility and the Unsecured Term Loans was determined by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, as advised by our bankers, at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining term, assuming no repayment until maturity. We have concluded that our determination of fair value for our mortgage loan payable, each of our senior unsecured notes and the Unsecured Term Loans was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs.

 Joint Venture 
 The Joint Venture was formed for the purpose of developing, leasing, operating and selling land located in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area. We hold our Joint Venture interest through a consolidated partnership (the "Joint Venture Partnership") in which we hold an interest and in which a third-party partner holds the remaining interest. As we hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Joint Venture Partnership, we consolidate the Joint Venture Partnership and reflect our partner's share as Noncontrolling Interest (see Note 6). The Joint Venture Partnership holds a interest in the unconsolidated Joint Venture, which we account for under the equity method of accounting. Excluding the minority interest holder's share, we own a interest in the Joint Venture. The Joint Venture Partnership is held through a wholly-owned TRS of the Operating Partnership. 
 Under the operating agreement for the Joint Venture, we act as the managing member and are entitled to receive fees for providing management, leasing, development, construction supervision, disposition and asset management services. In addition, the Joint Venture's operating agreement provides us the ability to earn incentive fees based on the ultimate financial performance of the Joint Venture. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we earned fees of and , respectively, from the Joint Venture, related to asset management, property management, leasing and development services we provided to the Joint Venture, of which we deferred recognition of and , respectively, due to our economic interest in the Joint Venture.

The gain on sale of real estate recognized by the Joint Venture during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to gain that was deferred on land sales during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The gain on sale was deferred because the Joint Venture was required to complete infrastructure work for the purchasers of the land. The deferred gain is being recognized under the percentage of completion method. Our economic share of the Joint Venture's gain on sale was . Included in net income of the Joint Venture during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is gain on sale of real estate of related to the sale of approximately acres of land for which our economic share was .

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Joint Venture substantially completed development of buildings totaling an aggregate million square feet of GLA (the "Project"). During the year ended December 31, 2022, in connection with the Project, the Joint Venture entered into a construction loan with a capacity of with a third-party lender (the "Joint Venture Loan"). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance of the Joint Venture Loan is and , respectively, excluding and , respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs. With respect to the Joint Venture Loan, we provided a completion guarantee to the lender and our third-party joint venture partner that requires the Company to timely complete construction of the Project. Total estimated investment for the Project is approximately and the Joint Venture is using a third-party general contractor to develop the buildings pursuant to a guaranteed maximum price contract. We also provided a guarantee to the lender related to typical non-recourse exceptions and an environmental indemnity. It is not possible to estimate the amount of additional costs, if any, that we may incur in connection with our completion guarantees to the third-party lender and/or our joint venture partner as well as the non-recourse exception and environmental indemnity guarantees; however, we do not expect that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees.

A portion of each Performance Award vests based upon the total shareholder return ("TSR") of the Company's common stock compared to the TSR of the FTSE Nareit All Equity Index and the remainder vests based upon the TSR of the Company s common stock compared to a specified group of peer industrial real estate companies. The performance period for these Performance Awards is . Compensation expense is charged to earnings over the applicable vesting period for the Performance Awards. At the end of the measuring period, vested Performance Units convert into shares of common stock. 
 Service Based Awards 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, shares of restricted stock units ("Service Units") and RLP Units ("Service RLP Units" and together with the Service Units, collectively the "Service Awards") were granted to certain employees and outside directors based on service-based criteria, which had an aggregate fair value of approximately on the grant date. The fair value of the Service Awards is based on the Company's stock price on the date such awards were approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Service Awards awarded to employees were based on the prior achievement of certain corporate performance goals and generally vest ratably over based on continued employment. Service Awards granted to outside directors vest after one year. Compensation expense is charged to earnings over the vesting periods for the Service Awards. At the end of the service period, vested Service Units convert into shares of common stock. 
 Retirement Eligibility 
 All award agreements issued underlying Performance Awards and Service Awards contain a retirement eligibility policy for employees with at least 10 years of continuous service and are at least 60 years old. For employees that meet the age and service eligibility requirements, their awards are non-forfeitable. As such, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we expensed 100 of the awards granted to retirement-eligible employees at the grant date as if fully vested. For employees who will meet the age and service eligibility requirements during the normal vesting periods, the grants are amortized over the shorter service period. Additionally, our Chief Executive Officer's employment agreement contains a retirement provision, which provides for all of his outstanding Performance Awards and Service Awards to be non-forfeitable effective December 31, 2024. As such, his Performance Awards and Service Awards granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are amortized over one year versus three years. 
 Outstanding Performance Awards and Service Awards 
 We recognized and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in compensation expense related to the amortization of the Service Awards and the Performance Awards.

General 
 The Company is a self-administered and fully integrated real estate company which owns, manages, acquires, sells, develops and redevelops industrial real estate. The Company is a Maryland corporation organized on August 10, 1993 and a real estate investment trust ("REIT") as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"). As of September 30, 2024, we owned 421 industrial properties located in 19 states, containing an aggregate of approximately 67.7 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"). Of the 421 properties owned on a consolidated basis, none of them are directly owned by the Company. 
 We began operations on July 1, 1994. The Company's operations are conducted primarily through the Operating Partnership, of which the Company is the sole general partner (the "General Partner"), with an approximate 97.3 ownership interest ("General Partner Units") at September 30, 2024. The Operating Partnership also conducts operations through several other limited partnerships (the "Other Real Estate Partnerships"), numerous limited liability companies ("LLCs") and certain taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), the operating data of which, together with that of the Operating Partnership, is consolidated with that of the Company as presented herein. The Operating Partnership holds at least a 99 limited partnership interest in each of the Other Real Estate Partnerships. The general partners of the Other Real Estate Partnerships are separate corporations, wholly-owned by the Company, each with at least a .01 general partnership interest in the Other Real Estate Partnerships. The Company does not have any significant assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership and its 100 ownership interest in the general partners of the Other Real Estate Partnerships. The noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership of approximately 2.7 at September 30, 2024 represents the aggregate partnership interest held by the limited partners thereof ("Limited Partner Units" and together with the General Partner Units, the "Units"). 
 Through a wholly-owned TRS of the Operating Partnership, we own an equity interest in a joint venture (the "Joint Venture"). We also provide various services to the Joint Venture. The Joint Venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Management's Overview 
 Business Objectives and Growth Plans 
 Our fundamental business objective is to maximize the total return to the Company's stockholders and the Operating Partnership's partners by increasing our cash flow and property values. Our long-term business growth plans include the following elements: 
 Internal Growth. We seek to grow internally by (i) increasing revenues by renewing or re-leasing spaces subject to expiring leases at higher rental levels; (ii) obtaining contractual rent escalations on our long-term leases; (iii) increasing occupancy levels at properties where vacancies exist and maintaining occupancy elsewhere; (iv) controlling and minimizing property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and releasing costs; and (v) renovating existing properties. 
 External Growth. We seek to grow externally through (i) the development of best-in-class industrial properties and the acquisition of individual or portfolios of industrial properties which meet our investment parameters within our 15 key logistics markets, with a primary emphasis on coastal markets; (ii) the expansion of our existing properties; and (iii) securing additional joint venture investments. 
 Portfolio Enhancement. We continually seek to upgrade our overall portfolio via new investments as well as through the sale of select assets that we believe do not exhibit favorable characteristics for long-term cash flow growth. We target new investments in 15 key logistics markets, with a primary emphasis on coastal markets, where developable land is more scarce and which exhibit desirable long-term growth characteristics. We seek to refine our portfolio over the coming years by focusing on bulk and regional warehouse properties and downsizing our light industrial holdings. 
 Our ability to pursue our long-term growth plans is affected by market conditions and our financial condition and operating capabilities. 
 Business Strategies 
 We utilize the following strategies in connection with the operation of our business: 
 Organizational Strategy. We implement a decentralized property operations strategy through the deployment of experienced regional management teams and local property managers. We provide acquisition, development and financing assistance, asset management oversight and financial reporting functions from our headquarters in Chicago, Illinois to support our regional operations. We believe the size of our portfolio enables us to realize operating efficiencies by spreading overhead among many properties and by negotiating purchasing discounts. 
 Market Strategy. Our market strategy is to concentrate on 15 key logistics markets in the United States, with a primary emphasis on coastal markets. These markets have one or more of the following characteristics: (i) favorable industrial real estate fundamentals, including improving industrial demand and constrained future supply that can lead to long-term rent growth; (ii) favorable economic and business environments that should benefit from increases in distribution activity driven by growth in global trade and local consumption; (iii) population growth as it generally drives industrial demand; (iv) natural barriers to entry and scarcity of land which are key elements in delivering future rent growth; and (v) sufficient size to provide ample opportunity for growth through incremental investments as well as offer asset liquidity. 
 Leasing and Marketing Strategy. We have an operational management strategy designed to enhance tenant satisfaction and portfolio performance. We pursue an active leasing strategy, which includes broadly marketing available space, seeking to renew existing leases at higher rents while minimizing re-leasing costs and seeking leases which provide for the pass-through of property-related expenses to the tenant. We also have local and national marketing programs which focus on the business and real estate brokerage communities and multi-national tenants. 
 Acquisition/Development Strategy. Our investment strategy is primarily focused on developing and acquiring industrial properties in 15 key logistics markets in the United States, with an emphasis on markets with a coastal orientation, through the deployment of experienced regional management teams. When evaluating potential industrial property acquisitions and developments, we consider such factors as: (i) the geographic area and type of property; (ii) the location, construction quality, functionality, condition and design of the property; (iii) the terms of tenant leases, including the potential for rent increases; (iv) the potential for economic growth and the general business, tax and regulatory environment of the area in which the property is located; (v) the occupancy and 
 32 

demand by tenants for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; (vi) competition from existing properties and the potential for the construction of new properties in the area; (vii) the potential for capital appreciation of the property; (viii) the ability to improve the property's performance through renovation; and (ix) the potential for expansion of the physical layout of the property and/or the number of sites. 
 Disposition Strategy. We continually evaluate local market conditions and property-related factors in all of our markets for purposes of identifying assets suitable for disposition. We look to sell properties with lower rent growth prospects and/or assets with less than optimal functionality and redeploy the capital into higher rent growth assets in key logistics markets primarily with a coastal orientation. We also seek to shrink our holdings of light industrial assets over time. 
 Financing Strategy. To finance acquisitions, developments and debt maturities, as market conditions permit, we may utilize a portion of proceeds from property sales, unsecured debt offerings, term loans, mortgage financings and line of credit borrowings under our 750.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "Unsecured Credit Facility"), and proceeds from the issuance, when and as warranted, of additional equity securities. We also continually evaluate joint venture arrangements as another source of capital to finance acquisitions and developments.

 We acquired five industrial properties totaling approximately 0.3 million square feet of GLA located in our Houston and Southern California markets for an aggregate purchase price of 44.8 million, excluding transaction costs. 
 We commenced speculative development of four industrial buildings totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet of GLA in our Houston, Nashville and South Florida markets. 
 We sold 17 industrial properties totaling approximately 1.0 million square feet of GLA for gross proceeds of 138.3 million. 
 Our significant financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were: 
 We declared first, second and third quarter cash dividends of 0.37 per common share or Unit per quarter, an increase of 15.6 from the 2023 quarterly rate. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 501.5 million available for additional borrowings under our Unsecured Credit Facility and cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 54.6 million, after excluding our Joint Venture partner's 6 share that we consolidate and report in our financial statements. Assuming the exercise of extension options in two of our bank loans, our next debt maturity is in 2026.

Results of Operations 
 The tables below summarize our revenues, property expenses and depreciation and other amortization by various categories for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Same store properties are properties owned prior to January 1, 2023 and held as an in-service property through September 30, 2024 and developments and redevelopments that were placed in service prior to January 1, 2023. Properties that are at least 75 occupied at acquisition are placed in service, unless we anticipate tenant move-outs within two years of ownership would drop occupancy below 75 . Properties that are less than 75 occupied at the date of acquisition are placed in service as they reach the earlier of 90 occupancy or one year subsequent to acquisition. Developments, redevelopments and acquired income-producing land parcels for which our ultimate intent is to redevelop or develop on the land parcel are placed in service as they reach the earlier of 90 occupancy or one year subsequent to development/redevelopment construction completion. Acquired properties with occupancy greater than 75 at acquisition, but with tenants that we anticipate will move out within two years of ownership, will be placed in service upon the earlier of reaching 90 occupancy or twelve months after move out. Properties are moved from the same store classification to the redevelopment classification when capital expenditures for a project are estimated to exceed 25 of the undepreciated gross book value of the property. Acquired properties are properties that were acquired subsequent to December 31, 2022 and held as an operating property through September 30, 2024. Sold properties are properties that were sold subsequent to December 31, 2022. Developments and redevelopments (collectively referred to as "(Re)Developments") include (re)developments that were not: a) substantially complete 12 months prior to January 1, 2023; or b) stabilized prior to January 1, 2023. Other revenues are derived from the operations of properties not placed in service under one of the categories discussed above, the operations of our maintenance company, interest income, joint venture fees and other miscellaneous revenues. Other property expenses are derived from the operations of properties not placed in service under one of the categories discussed above, the operations of our maintenance company, vacant land expenses and other miscellaneous regional expenses. 
 Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the future acquisition, (re)development and sale of properties. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical rates.

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Our net income was 225.5 million and 194.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average daily occupancy rate of our same store properties was 96.8 and 97.9 , respectively.

 Revenues from same store properties increased 18.7 million primarily due to increases in rental rates and tenant recoveries, offset by a decrease in occupancy. Revenues from acquired properties increased 2.7 million due to the nine industrial properties acquired subsequent to December 31, 2022 totaling approximately 0.4 million square feet of GLA. Revenues from sold properties decreased 7.9 million due to the 28 industrial properties sold subsequent to December 31, 2022 totaling approximately 2.0 million square feet of GLA. Revenues from (re)developments increased 22.3 million due to an increase in occupancy and tenant recoveries. Revenues from other increased 1.4 million primarily due to revenues from income-producing land parcels for which our ultimate intent is to redevelop, develop or sell the applicable land parcel, offset by a decrease in joint venture fees and legal settlement proceeds.

 Property expenses include real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management, utilities, insurance and other property related expenses. Property expenses from same store properties increased 4.8 million primarily due to an increase in real estate tax expense, snow removal costs and repair and maintenance expense. Property expenses from acquired properties increased 0.6 million due to properties acquired subsequent to December 31, 2022. Property expenses from sold properties decreased 2.2 million due to properties sold subsequent to December 31, 2022. Property expenses from (re)developments increased 6.8 million primarily due to the substantial completion of developments. Property expenses from other remained relatively unchanged. 
 General and administrative expense increased by 3.3 million, or 12.1 , primarily driven by higher equity compensation expense. This increase is due to the accelerated recognition of expense for certain tenured employees who are, or will soon become, retirement eligible prior to the standard vesting schedule. Additionally, the increase was influenced by a modest increase in overall compensation and a slight decrease in the amount of compensation capitalized to development activities. 
 Joint Venture development services expense, representing payments made to a third party for property development assistance within the Joint Venture, decreased by 1.7 million, or 62.6 . This decline is attributed to a reduction in development activities by our Joint Venture during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change in 000's) DEPRECIATION AND OTHER AMORTIZATION Same Store Properties 109,644 110,466 (822) (0.7) Acquired Properties 1,232 283 949 335.3 Sold Properties 966 2,650 (1,684) (63.5) (Re)Developments 14,925 6,112 8,813 144.2 Corporate Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment and Other 1,615 1,997 (382) (19.1) Total Depreciation and Other Amortization 128,382 121,508 6,874 5.7 
 Depreciation and other amortization from same store properties remained relatively unchanged. Depreciation and other amortization from acquired properties increased 0.9 million due to properties acquired subsequent to December 31, 2022. Depreciation and other amortization from sold properties decreased 1.7 million due to properties sold subsequent to December 31, 2022. Depreciation and other amortization from (re)developments increased 8.8 million primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization related to completed developments. Depreciation from corporate furniture, fixtures and equipment and other decreased 0.4 million as certain improvements on land parcels, for which our ultimate intent is to redevelop or develop, became fully depreciated. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 93.8 million of gain on sale of real estate related to the sale of 17 industrial properties totaling approximately 1.0 million square feet of GLA. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 47.4 million of gain on sale of real estate related to the sale of four industrial properties totaling approximately 0.2 million square feet of GLA and two land parcels. 
 Interest expense increased by 8.9 million, or 16.6 , primarily due to a 4.7 million reduction in capitalized interest during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the increase in interest expense was influenced by a higher weighted average debt balance of 2,231.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up from 2,155.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as well as an increase in the weighted average interest rate to 4.14 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Amortization of debt issuance costs remained relatively unchanged. 
 Equity in income of joint venture for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.2 million, representing our pro-rata share of the net income generated by the Joint Venture. This income is derived from rental operations and expenses related to three industrial properties, totaling 1.8 million square feet of GLA, that were completed by the joint venture during this period. In comparison, equity in income of joint venture for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 30.6 million. This higher amount included our pro-rata share of gain from the sale of real estate by the Joint Venture and related incentive fees. Both periods include the 6 interest held by our partner in the Joint Venture, which is consolidated and reported in our financial statements. 
 Income tax provision decreased 3.1 million, or 38.4 , primarily due to a reduction in our pro-rata share of taxable gain and incentive fees from the Joint Venture. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in income tax expense associated with gains from the sale of real estate.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 56.8 million of gain on sale of real estate related to the sale of seven industrial properties totaling approximately 0.4 million square feet of GLA. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 34.4 million of gain on sale of real estate related to the sale of three industrial properties totaling approximately 0.03 million square feet of GLA and one land parcel. 
 Interest expense increased by 0.9 million, or 4.7 , primarily due to a 1.6 million reduction in capitalized interest during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was partially offset by a lower weighted average debt balance of 2,182.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,233.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a slight decrease in the weighted average interest rate, which fell to 4.08 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.10 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Amortization of debt issuance costs remained relatively unchanged. 
 Equity in income of joint venture decreased 0.9 million, or 60.8 , primarily due to an increase in our pro-rata share of depreciation, amortization and interest expense recognized by the Joint Venture following the substantial completion of three buildings totaling 1.8 million square feet of GLA during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 At September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash was approximately 54.6 million, after excluding our Joint Venture partner's share of cash and cash equivalents that we consolidate and report in our financial statements. We also had 501.5 million available for additional borrowings under our Unsecured Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 We have considered our short-term liquidity needs through September 30, 2025, as well as the adequacy of our estimated cash flow from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet those needs. As of September 30, 2024, our Unsecured Credit Facility had an outstanding balance of 248.0 million, maturing on July 7, 2025, with two six-month extension options available. We are evaluating whether to extend the maturity by exercising the extension options or enter into a new facility. Additionally, we have a 300.0 million unsecured term loan maturing on August 12, 2025, with two one-year extension options. We are considering either extending the maturity by exercising the extension option or refinancing part or all of this term loan with new indebtedness. Apart from these payment obligations, we believe that our principal short-term liquidity needs include funding normal recurring expenses, property acquisitions, developments, renovations, expansions, other nonrecurring capital improvements, debt service requirements, the minimum distributions required to maintain the Company's REIT qualification under the Code and distributions approved by the Company's Board of Directors. We anticipate that these will be met with cash flows provided by operating activities as well as the disposition of select assets. These needs may also be met by the issuance of other debt or equity securities or borrowings under our Unsecured Credit Facility, subject to market conditions. 
 We expect to meet long-term (after September 30, 2025) liquidity requirements such as property acquisitions, developments, scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other nonrecurring capital improvements through the disposition of select assets, long-term unsecured and secured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities, subject to market conditions. 
 Our Unsecured Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants including limitations on incurrence of debt and debt service coverage. Our access to borrowings may be limited if we fail to meet any of these covenants. We believe that we were in compliance with our financial covenants as of September 30, 2024, and we anticipate that we will be able to operate in compliance with our financial covenants for the next twelve months. 
 As of October 18, 2024, we had approximately 483.5 million available for additional borrowings under our Unsecured Credit Facility. 
 Our senior unsecured notes have been assigned credit ratings from Standard Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Ratings of BBB/Stable, Baa2/Stable and BBB/Positive, respectively. In the event of a downgrade, we believe we would continue to have access to sufficient capital. However, our cost of borrowing would increase and our ability to access certain financial markets may be limited.

Cash Flow Activity 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 275,708 240,444 Net cash used in investing activities (67,505) (322,880) Net cash used in financing activities (196,858) (8,430) 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the Operating Partnership for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 275,745 240,428 Net cash used in investing activities (67,505) (322,880) Net cash used in financing activities (196,895) (8,414) 
 Changes in cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year comparable period are described as follows: 
 Operating Activities: Cash provided by operating activities increased 35.3 million, primarily due to the following: 
 increase in net operating income ("NOI") from same store properties, acquired properties and recently developed properties of 31.5 million offset by a decrease in NOI due to the disposition of real estate of 5.7 million; and 
 increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities, rents received in advance and security deposits due to timing of cash payment; offset by: 
 decrease in distributions from our Joint Venture of 4.3 million in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Investing Activities: Cash used in investing activities decreased 255.4 million, primarily due to the following: 
 decrease of 170.6 million related to the acquisition, development and investment in real estate attributed to fewer acquisitions and reduced expenditures for developments under construction during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023; 
 increase of 77.1 million in net proceeds received from the disposition of real estate in 2024 as compared to 2023; and 
 decrease of 6.1 million in contributions to the Joint Venture in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Financing Activities: Cash used in financing activities increased 188.4 million 188.5 million for the Operating Partnership), primarily due to the following: 
 decrease in net borrowings under our Unsecured Credit Facility of 183.0 million in 2024 as compared to 2023; and 
 increase in dividend and unit distributions of 17.2 million due to the Company increasing the dividend rate in 2024 as well as an increase in common shares and units outstanding; offset by: 
 decrease in distributions to noncontrolling interests of 11.4 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.

Market Risk 
 The following discussion about our risk-management activities includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our business subjects us to market risk from interest rates, as described below. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The following analysis presents the hypothetical gain or loss in earnings, cash flows or fair value of the financial instruments and derivative instruments that are held by us at September 30, 2024 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. While this analysis may have some use as a benchmark, it should not be viewed as a forecast. 
 In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either non-financial or non-quantifiable. Such risks principally include credit risk and legal risk and are not represented in the following analysis. 
 At September 30, 2024, 1,933.3 million, or 88.6 , of our total debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, was fixed rate debt, while 248.0 million, or 11.4 , was variable rate debt. At December 31, 2023, 1,933.5 million, or 86.6 , of our total debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, was fixed rate debt, while 299.0 million, or 13.4 , was variable rate debt. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fixed rate debt amounts include variable rate debt that has been effectively swapped to a fixed rate through the use of derivative instruments with an aggregate notional amount outstanding of 925.0 million that mitigate our exposure to our Unsecured Term Loans' variable interest rates, which are currently based on SOFR. The use of derivative financial instruments allows us to manage the negative effects that increases in interest rates would have on our earnings and cash flows. We designated all of the swaps related to our Unsecured Term Loans as cash flow hedges. Currently, we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. 
 For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in the base interest rate used to calculate the all-in interest rate generally do not impact the fair value of the debt, but would affect our future earnings and cash flows. The interest rate risk and changes in fair market value of fixed rate debt generally do not have a significant impact on us until we are required to refinance such debt. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the maturity dates of our various fixed rate debt. 
 Our variable rate debt is subject to risk based upon prevailing market interest rates. If the SOFR rate component relevant to our variable rate debt were to have increased 10 , we estimate that our interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have increased by approximately 1.2 million based on our average outstanding floating-rate debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, if weighted average interest rates on our weighted average fixed rate debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were to have increased by 10 due to refinancing, interest expense would have increased by approximately 5.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of our debt was approximately 2,115.8 million based on our estimate of the then-current market interest rates.

Supplemental Earnings Measure 
 Investors in and industry analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations ("FFO") and NOI as supplemental operating performance measures of an equity REIT. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time through depreciation. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors prefer to supplement operating results that use historical cost accounting with measures such as FFO and NOI, among others. We provide information related to FFO and same store NOI ("SS NOI") both because such industry analysts are interested in such information, and because our management believes FFO and SS NOI are important performance measures. FFO and SS NOI are factors used by management in measuring our performance, including for purposes of determining the compensation of our executive officers under our 2024 incentive compensation plan. 
 Neither FFO nor SS NOI should be considered as a substitute for net income, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Neither FFO nor SS NOI represents cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and neither should be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, nor is either indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. 
 Funds From Operations 
 The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") has recognized and defined for the real estate industry a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance, FFO, that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. FFO is calculated by us in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. In accordance with the NAREIT definition of FFO, we calculate FFO to be equal to net income available to First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.'s common stockholders and participating securities, plus depreciation and other amortization of real estate, plus impairment of real estate, minus gain or plus loss on sale of real estate, net of any income tax provision or benefit associated with the sale of real estate. We also exclude the same adjustments from our share of net income from an unconsolidated joint venture. 
 Management believes that the use of FFO available to common stockholders and participating securities, combined with net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes that, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of real estate assets, impairment of real estate assets and real estate asset depreciation and amortization, investors and analysts are able to identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT's activity and use these operating results for assistance in comparing these operating results between periods or to those of different companies. 
 The following table shows a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders and participating securities to the calculation of FFO available to common stockholders and participating securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Same Store Net Operating Income 
 SS NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that provides a measure of rental operations and, as calculated by us, does not factor in depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expense, interest expense, income tax benefit and expense, equity in income or loss from joint venture, joint venture fees and joint venture development services expense. We define SS NOI as revenues minus property expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management, utilities, insurance and other expenses, minus the NOI of properties that are not same store properties and minus the impact of straight-line rent, above and below market rent amortization and lease termination fees. We exclude straight-line rent and above (below) market rent in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. As so defined, SS NOI may not be comparable to same store net operating income or similar measures reported by other REITs that define same store properties or NOI differently. The major factors influencing SS NOI are occupancy levels, rental rate increases or decreases and tenant recoveries increases or decreases. Our success depends largely upon our ability to lease space and to recover the operating costs associated with those leases from our tenants. 
 The following table shows a reconciliation of the same store revenues and property expenses disclosed in the results of operations (and reconciled to revenues and expenses reflected on the statements of operations) to SS NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.
