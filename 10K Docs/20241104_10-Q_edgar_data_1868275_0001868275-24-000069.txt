 undivided ownership interest in the jointly owned STP, a MW, dual-unit nuclear plant located in Bay City, Texas. The net cash paid was billion, after certain purchase price adjustments. Other owners include City Public Service Board of San Antonio (CPS, and the City of Austin, Texas (Austin, ). See Note 2 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. 
 ownership interest in STP to CPS at the same price and terms that we paid NRG for our interest, subject to regulatory approvals from the NRC and the Public Utility Commission of Texas. Pursuant to the settlement, CPS and Austin filed Notices of Dismissal with Prejudice with the Court, which ends the litigation, and likewise withdrew their pending objections to the sale with the NRC. As a result of the settlement, we have reflected assets and liabilities associated with a undivided ownership interest in STP as held for sale. The held for sale amounts are included in the Other current assets and Other current liabilities balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. Closing is expected to occur within the first half of 2025. Upon closing of the sale, we and CPS will each own a interest in STP, and Austin s interest will remain at . The terms of settlement are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

 Contract Liabilities 
 We record contract liabilities when consideration is received or due prior to the satisfaction of the performance obligations. We record contract liabilities in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These contract liabilities primarily relate to upfront consideration received or due for equipment service plans, the Mystic COS, and the Illinois ZEC program. The Mystic COS, which ended in May 2024, included upfront consideration received that differs from the recognized earnings over the cost of the service period. The Illinois ZEC program introduces an annual cap on the total consideration to be received by us for each delivery period. The ZEC price is established on a per MWh of production basis with a maximum annual cap for total compensation to be received for each planning year (June through May), while requiring delivery of all ZECs produced by our participating facilities during each delivery period. ZECs delivered to Illinois utilities in excess of the annual cost cap may be paid in subsequent years if the payments do not exceed the prescribed annual cost cap for that year. The balance as of September 30, 2024 primarily related to equipment service plans. The balance as of December 31, 2023 primarily related to equipment services plans and the Mystic COS.

 Our Clinton and Quad Cities units contract with certain utilities in Illinois which requires delivery of all ZECs produced during each planning year (June through May), with total compensation limited by an annual cap for each planning year designed to limit the cost of ZECs to each utility's customers. ZECs delivered that, if paid, would result in the annual cap being exceeded may be paid in subsequent years at the vintage year price as long as the payments would not exceed the annual cap in the year paid. In each planning year since the program commenced June 2017, we delivered ZECs to the utilities in excess of the annual compensation cap. 
 The ZEC price and annual compensation cap effective for each planning year are administratively determined by the IPA. For the June 2023 through May 2024 planning year, the ZEC price has been established at 0.30 per ZEC, subject to an annual cap of 224 million. ZECs generated and delivered during this planning year will not exceed the annual cap, providing capacity to compensate for ZECs delivered in prior planning years in excess of the compensation cap. During the second quarter of 2023, we recognized million of revenue as a receivable for ZECs delivered in prior planning years, with payment received in the third quarter of 2024. For the June 2024 through May 2025 planning year, the ZEC price has been established at 9.38 per ZEC, subject to an annual cap of 222 million. Revenue recognized during the second quarter of 2024 for ZECs delivered in prior planning years was not material. 
 Revenue Disaggregation 
 We disaggregate the revenue recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. See Note 4 Segment Information for the presentation of revenue disaggregation.

 Note 4 Segment Information 

 4. 
 reportable segments consisting of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT, and all other power regions referred to collectively as Other Power Regions. 
 The basis for our reportable segments is the integrated management of our electricity business that is located in different geographic regions, and largely representative of the footprints of ISO/RTO and/or NERC regions, which utilize multiple supply sources to provide electricity through various distribution channels (wholesale and retail). Our hedging strategies and risk metrics are also aligned to these same geographic regions. Descriptions of each of our reportable segments are as follows: 
 Mid-Atlantic represents operations in the eastern half of PJM, which includes New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, the District of Columbia, and parts of Pennsylvania and North Carolina. 
 Midwest represents operations in the western half of PJM and the United States footprint of MISO, excluding MISO s Southern Region. 
 New York represents operations within NYISO. 
 ERCOT represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas that covers a majority of the state of Texas. 
 Other Power Regions: 
 New England represents operations within ISO-NE. 
 South represents operations in FRCC, MISO s Southern Region, and the remaining portions of SERC not included within MISO or PJM. 
 West represents operations in WECC, which includes CAISO. 
 Canada represents operations across the entire country of Canada and includes AESO, OIESO, and the Canadian portion of MISO. 
 The CODM evaluates the performance of our electric business activities and allocates resources based on Operating revenues net of Purchased power and fuel expense (RNF). We believe this is a useful measurement of operational performance, although it is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Our operating revenues include all sales to third parties as well as government assistance. Purchased power costs include all costs associated with the procurement and supply of electricity including capacity, energy, and ancillary services. Fuel expense includes the fuel costs for our owned generation and fuel costs associated with tolling agreements. The results of our other business activities are not regularly reviewed by the CODM and are therefore not classified as operating segments or included in the regional reportable segment amounts. These activities include wholesale and retail sales of natural gas, energy-related sales in the United Kingdom, as well as sales of other energy-related products and sustainable solutions that are not significant to our overall results of operations. Further, our unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedging activities and our amortization of certain intangible assets and liabilities relating to commodity contracts recorded at fair value from mergers and acquisitions are also excluded from the regional reportable segment amounts. The CODM does not use a measure of total assets in making decisions regarding allocating resources to or assessing the performance of these reportable segments.

 million and million, respectively. Our estimate required the exercise of judgment in determining the amount of nuclear PTC expected for each of our nuclear units. Since the amount of nuclear PTC is a function of annual gross receipts, the actual amount of PTC earned cannot be determined until 2025 and may be different from this initial estimate. Further, the nuclear PTC continues to be the subject of additional guidance expected to be issued from the U.S. Treasury and IRS that may materially impact the total amount of benefits we receive. 
 Nuclear PTCs are initially recorded within Other deferred debits and other assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified as a reduction to Accounts payable and accrued expenses when used to reduce our federal income tax payable, or an increase in Cash and cash equivalents or Other current assets when sold, depending on the specific payment terms of each contract. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we executed agreements for the sale of billion of nuclear PTCs to unaffiliated third parties at a nominal discount, with approximately million of cash proceeds received upon sale (included within Cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows) and approximately million to be received over the course of the fourth quarter of 2024 and first quarter of 2025. As of September 30, 2024, our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect approximately, million of estimated nuclear PTCs within Other deferred debits and other assets, million within Other current assets, and a reduction to Accounts payable and accrued expenses of million for estimated nuclear PTCs that we have utilized as a credit against our current federal income taxes payable. 
 Many of the state-sponsored programs providing compensation for the emissions-free attributes of generation from certain of our nuclear units include contractual or other provisions that require us to refund that compensation up to the amount of the nuclear PTC received or pass through the entirety of the nuclear PTC received. As of September 30, 2024, we have recognized approximately million of estimated payables within Other deferred credits and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and a reduction to net operating revenue of approximately million (pre-tax) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and recognized approximately million of net operating revenue (pre-tax) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 associated with programs requiring refunds or pass through of the nuclear PTC in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. As with the actual amount of the PTC earned, which cannot be determined until after the end of the calendar year, the actual amounts due under state-sponsored programs may be different from our initial estimate.

 billion through August 2025. Under the Facility, NER may sell eligible short-term customer accounts receivable to the Purchasers in exchange for cash and subordinated interest. The transfers are reported as sales of receivables in the consolidated financial statements. The subordinated interest in collections upon the receivables sold to the Purchasers is referred to as the DPP, which is reflected in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The Facility requires the balance of eligible receivables to be maintained at or above the balance of cash proceeds received from the Purchasers. To the extent the eligible receivables decrease below such balance, we are required to repay cash to the Purchasers. When eligible receivables exceed cash proceeds, we have the ability to increase the cash received up to the maximum funding limit. These cash inflows and outflows impact the DPP.

 Our risk of loss following the transfer of accounts receivable is limited to the DPP outstanding. Payment of DPP is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred. 
 We recognize the cash proceeds received upon sale in Cash flows from operating activities within the Changes in Other assets and liabilities line in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, which were million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The collection and reinvestment of DPP is recognized in Cash flows from investing activities in the Collection of DPP, net line in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, which were million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net million decrease in the ARO for the changes in the amounts and timing of estimated decommissioning cash flows was driven by multiple adjustments, including the following: 
 Net decrease of approximately million due to changes in assumed retirement dates for various plants, including Braidwood, Byron, Calvert Cliffs, FitzPatrick, LaSalle, Limerick, NMP Unit 2, Quad Cities, and Crane. 
 A decrease of approximately million related to a change in assumed timing of DOE acceptance of SNF. 
 An increase of approximately million due to an increase in cost escalation rates and lower discount rates. 
 The 2024 ARO update resulted in a decrease of million in Operating and maintenance expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The 2023 ARO update resulted in a decrease of million in Operating and maintenance expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

 Tax Refunds and Attributes. The TMA provides for the allocation of certain pre-closing tax attributes between us and Exelon. Tax attributes will be allocated in accordance with the principles set forth in the existing Exelon tax sharing agreement, unless otherwise required by law. Under the TMA, we will be entitled to refunds for taxes for which we are responsible. In addition, it is expected that Exelon will have tax attributes that may be used to offset Exelon s future tax liabilities. A significant portion of such attributes were generated by our business. In February 2024, we executed an amendment to the TMA that modified the timing of Exelon's payment of amounts due to us. As of September 30, 2024, our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflects receivables of million and million in Other accounts receivable and Other deferred debits and other assets, respectively.

 We routinely enter into supply forward contracts with certain utilities with one-sided collateral postings only from us. If market prices fall below the benchmark price levels in these contracts, the utilities are not required to post collateral. However, when market prices rise above the benchmark price levels, we are required to post collateral once certain unsecured credit limits are exceeded.

 Environmental Remediation Matters 
 General. Our operations have in the past, and may in the future, require substantial expenditures to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under Federal and state environmental laws, we are generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by us. We own or lease several real estate parcels, including parcels on which our operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. In addition, we are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. Unless otherwise disclosed, we cannot reasonably estimate whether we will incur significant liabilities for additional investigation and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by us, environmental agencies, or others. Additional costs could have a material, unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had accrued undiscounted amounts for environmental liabilities of million and million, respectively, in Accounts payable and accrued expenses and million and million, respectively, in Other deferred credits and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on environmental remediation matters. As of September 30, 2024, and through the date of filing, there have been no material changes in amounts recognized for the matters discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Litigation 
 General. We are involved in various other litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. We maintain accruals for such losses that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss, particularly where (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss. 
 See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on litigation matters. As of September 30, 2024, and through the date of filing, there have been no significant developments to the matters discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Asbestos Personal Injury Claims. We maintain a reserve for claims associated with asbestos-related personal injury actions at certain facilities that are currently owned by us or were previously owned by ComEd, PECO, or BGE. The estimated liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis and exclude the estimated legal costs associated with handling these matters, which could be material.

 million and million, respectively, in total for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. As of September 30, 2024, approximately million of this amount related to open claims presented to us, while the remaining million is for estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims anticipated to arise through 2055, based on actuarial assumptions and analyses, which are updated on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, we monitor actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments and evaluate whether adjustments to the estimated liabilities are necessary.

 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock. In April 2024, our Board of Directors approved a billion increase to the program, authorizing up to billion in total repurchases. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately million of remaining authority to repurchase shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. No other repurchase plans or programs have been authorized. See Note 20 Shareholders' Equity of our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on our share repurchase program. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased from the open market million shares of our common stock for a total cost, inclusive of taxes and transaction costs, of million. There were open market repurchases for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased from the open market million and million shares, respectively, of our common stock for a total cost, inclusive of taxes and transaction costs, of million and million, respectively. 
 In 2024, we entered into ASR agreements with financial institutions to initiate share repurchases of our common stock. Under the ASR agreements, we paid a specified amount to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of shares of common stock, which resulted in an immediate reduction in the number of our shares outstanding. Based on the terms of the ASR agreements below, we received an initial share delivery based on of the ASR agreements' cost. Upon settlement of the ASR agreements, the financial institution delivers additional incremental shares. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR agreement based on the average of the daily-volume weighted average share price, less a discount.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 (Dollars in millions except per share data, unless otherwise noted) 
 
 Executive Overview 
 We are a supplier of carbon-free energy. Our generating capacity primarily consists of nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas and hydroelectric assets. Through our integrated business operations, we sell electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related products and sustainable solutions to various types of customers, including distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets across multiple geographic regions. We have five reportable segments: Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT and Other Power Regions. 
 
 Significant Transactions and Developments 
 Crane Clean Energy Center 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we executed a 20-year PPA with Microsoft that will support the restart of Three Mile Island Unit 1, renamed as the Crane Clean Energy Center, which was retired in 2019 for economic reasons. Under the agreement, Microsoft will purchase the output generated from the renewed plant as part of its goal to help power its data centers in PJM with clean energy. We expect Crane will also be eligible for the technology-neutral clean electricity PTC (45Y) provided for by the IRA for its first 10 years of operations. We estimate the project will require approximately 1.6 billion of cash from operations for capital expenditures necessary to restart the plant, with an estimated in-service date of 2028. The restart of the plant and delivery of electricity under the PPA is subject to certain regulatory approvals, including the NRC comprehensive safety and environmental review, as well as permits from relevant state and local agencies. Additionally, through a separate request, we will pursue obtaining a renewed license that will extend operations at the plant to at least 2054. 
 Nuclear PTC 
 As a result of the enactment of the IRA, we qualify for certain federal government incentives through eligible activities. These incentives include both refundable and transferable tax credits. Beginning in 2024, our existing nuclear units are eligible for a PTC extending through 2032. The nuclear PTC (45U) provides a transferable credit up to 15 per MWh (a base credit of 3 per MWh with a five times multiplier provided certain prevailing wage requirements are met) and is subject to phase-out when annual gross receipts are between 25.00 per MWh and 43.75 per MWh. We have determined that we will meet the annual prevailing wage requirements at all our nuclear units and are eligible for the five times multiplier. Both the amount of the PTC and the gross receipts thresholds adjust annually for inflation over the duration of the program, and the benefits of the PTC may be realized through a credit against our federal income taxes or transferred via sale to an unrelated party. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income include an estimate of 670 million and 1,380 million, respectively, that is reflected in Operating revenues. See Note 5 Government Assistance of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 In April 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 1 billion increase to the previously announced share repurchase program, authorizing total repurchases of up to 3 billion. As of September 30, 2024, we have purchased a total of approximately 16.1 million shares for a total cost of 2 billion, with remaining authority to purchase up to 991 million of the Company's outstanding common stock. See Note 14 Shareholders' Equity of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 Other Key Business Drivers 
 Russia and Ukraine Conflict 
 We are closely monitoring developments of the ongoing Russia and Ukraine conflict, including United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Canadian sanctions, and legislation that may impact exports and imports of Russian nuclear fuel supply and enrichment activities, as well as the potential for Russia to limit fuel deliveries. We are cognizant of the recent enactment of the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act that bans the import of low-enriched uranium into the U.S. that is produced in Russia or by Russian entities, absent a waiver from the DOE. The passage of this bill will allow the Department of Energy to begin the process of distributing billions of dollars that were previously appropriated to support expansion of the domestic nuclear fuel cycle within the United States to improve carbon-free energy security. Our fuel procurement activities comply with all U.S. and international trade laws and to-date, our nuclear fuel deliveries have not been affected by the Russia and Ukraine conflict. Our nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium supply and service contracts. We work with a diverse set of domestic and international suppliers years in advance to procure our nuclear fuel and generally have enough nuclear fuel to support all our refueling needs for multiple years regardless of sanctions. Recognizing the potential for the continuing conflict to impact our longer-term security and cost of supply, we have entered into contracts to increase the size of our nuclear fuel inventory. We will continue to take advantage of all available avenues to ensure continuity in our nuclear fuel supply, including working with our diverse set of suppliers to ensure we can secure the nuclear fuel needed to continue to operate our nuclear fleet long-term and provide the necessary fuel to bridge potential Russian supply disruption into 2029, which is the date multiple suppliers have indicated they will have incremental additional capacity online. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 Regulation of GHGs from Power Plants under the Clean Air Act. In April 2024, EPA issued a final rule that regulates greenhouse gases from existing coal, new natural gas-fired power plants, and existing oil/gas steam generators under Clean Air Act section 111. The applicable standards are subcategorized by retirement date for existing coal and capacity factor for existing gas. We are evaluating market impacts of this rule, which will be affected by upcoming state implementation and ongoing litigation. EPA has solicited comment on approaches for regulating GHGs from existing gas plants in a docket that closed in May 2024. In October 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request to temporarily block implementation of EPA's GHG standards for existing coal, new gas and existing oil/gas steam generators. The DC Circuit currently is considering the merits of EPA's GHG power plant rule. We cannot reasonably predict the outcome of this matter. 
 Good Neighbor Rule. On June 5, 2023, the EPA published a final rule called Federal 'Good Neighbor Plan' for the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards also known as the "Transport Rule". The rule, among other things, establishes nitrogen oxides emissions budgets requiring fossil fuel-fired power plants in 23 states to participate in an allowance-based ozone season trading program beginning in 2023. On February 13, 2023, EPA disapproved state implementation plans submitted by 21 states for failure to address their obligations under the "good neighbor" provisions of the Clean Air Act. However, several Regional Courts of Appeals issued orders staying, pending judicial review, EPA's disapproval of several state plans (including Texas). In June 2024, the Supreme Court stayed EPA s rule for the duration of the litigation. The rule is currently under review on the merits before the D.C. Circuit and we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of this litigation. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management makes a number of significant estimates, assumptions, and judgements in the preparation of our financial statements. At September 30, 2024, our critical accounting policies and estimates had not changed significantly from December 31, 2023, with the exception of accounting for government grants and disclosure of government assistance. See Note 5 Government Assistance of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and ITEM 7.

 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings. We utilize Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings (and/or its per share equivalent) in our internal analysis, and in communications with investors and analysts, as a consistent measure for comparing our financial performance and discussing the factors and trends affecting our business. The presentation of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is intended to complement and should not be considered an alternative to, nor more useful than, the presentation of GAAP Net Income.

Table of Contents 

 The table below provides a reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a standardized financial measure and may not be comparable to other companies presentations of similarly titled measures. 
 Unless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling adjustment between GAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. For all adjustments except the NDT fund investment returns, which are included in decommissioning-related activities, the marginal statutory income tax rate was 25.5 and 25.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Under IRS regulations, NDT fund investment returns are taxed at different rates for investments if they are in qualified or non-qualified funds. The effective tax rates for the unrealized and realized gains and losses related to NDT funds were 54.6 and 52.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 55.3 and 55.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table provides a reconciliation between GAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023. The variance in Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders was favorable by 469 million primarily due to: 
 Favorable nuclear PTCs related to the IRA beginning in 2024; 
 Favorable net realized and unrealized NDT activity; 
 Favorable market and portfolio conditions primarily driven by higher realized margins on load contracts and generation-to-load optimization; and 
 Favorable mark-to-market activity and other fair value adjustments. 
 The favorable items were partially offset by: 
 Higher labor (inclusive of incentives), contracting, and materials; 
 Lower unrealized gains resulting from an investment that became a publicly traded company in the second quarter of 2023; and 
 Unfavorable impacts of nuclear outages.

 Nuclear Fleet Capacity Factor. The following table presents nuclear fleet operating data for our plants that, reflects ownership percentage of stations operated by us and excludes Salem and STP, which are operated by PSEG and STPNOC, respectively. The nuclear fleet capacity factor presented in the table is defined as the ratio of the actual output of a plant over a period of time to its output if the plant had operated at its net monthly mean capacity for that time period. We consider capacity factor to be a useful measure to analyze the nuclear fleet performance between periods. We have included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or be more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.

 Nuclear PTC. Beginning in 2024, our nuclear units are eligible for a PTC extending through 2032. The nuclear PTC provides a transferable credit up to 15 per MWh (a base credit of 3 per MWh with a five times multiplier provided certain prevailing wage requirements are met) and is subject to phase-out when annual gross receipts are between 25.00 per MWh and 43.75 per MWh. We have determined that we will meet the annual prevailing wage requirements at all our nuclear units and are eligible for the five times multiplier. Both the amount of the PTC and the gross receipts thresholds adjust for inflation after 2024 through the duration of the program based on the GDP price deflator for the preceding calendar year. The benefits of the PTC may be realized through a credit against our federal income taxes or transferred via sale to an unrelated party. 
 Many of the state-sponsored programs (i.e., ZECs and CMCs) providing compensation for the emissions-free attributes of generation from certain of our nuclear units include contractual or other provisions that require us to refund that compensation up to the amount of the nuclear PTC received or pass through the entirety of the nuclear PTC received. See Note 5 Government Assistance of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the nuclear PTC. 
 ZEC Prices. We are compensated through state programs for the carbon-free attributes of our nuclear generation. Gross revenues from ZEC programs are a significant contributor to our total operating revenues. The following table includes the average ZEC reference prices /MWh) for each of our major regions in which state programs have been enacted. Gross prices reflect the weighted average price for the various delivery periods within the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and may not necessarily reflect prices we ultimately realize as a result of interaction with the nuclear PTC discussed above.

 (a) See ITEM 1. BUSINESS, Environmental Matters of our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the plants receiving payments through state programs. 
 (b) The ZEC price is expected to be 10.00/MWh for each delivery period and is subject to an annual update once full year generation is known. Following the latest annual update in August 2024, the ZEC price for the delivery period beginning June 2023 through May 2024 was calculated to be 9.95.

 Illinois CMC Price. The price received (paid) for each CMC is determined by the IPA monthly and is based on the accepted CMC bid, less the sum of (a) monthly weighted average PJM Busbar price, (b) ComEd zone capacity price and (c) any federal tax credit or subsidy received and is subject to a customer protection cap 30.30 per MWh for initial delivery period June 2022 through May 2023, 32.50 per MWh for the period June 2023 through May 2024, and 33.43 per MWh for the period June 2024 through May 2025). If the monthly CMC price per MWh calculation results in a net positive value, ComEd will multiply that value by the delivered quantity and pay the total to us. If the CMC price per MWh calculation results in a net negative value, we will multiply this value by the delivered quantity and pay the net value to ComEd. The average CMC prices per MWh were 5.54 and 2.12 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 7.73 and 3.54 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average CMC prices may not necessarily reflect prices we ultimately realize as a result of interaction with the nuclear PTC discussed above. 
 Capacity Prices. We participate in capacity auctions in each of our major regions, except ERCOT which does not have a capacity market. We also incur capacity costs associated with load served, which are factored into customer sales prices. Capacity prices have a significant impact on our operating revenues and purchased power and fuel expense. We report capacity on a net monthly basis within each region in either Operating revenues or Purchased power and fuel expense, depending on our net monthly position. The following table presents the average capacity prices /MW Day) for each of our major regions. Prices reflect the weighted average prices for the various auction periods within the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Electricity Prices. As a producer and supplier of electricity, the price of electricity has a significant impact on our operating revenues and purchased power cost. We report the sale and purchase of electricity in the spot market on a net hourly basis in either Operating revenues or Purchased power and fuel expense within each region, depending on our net hourly position. The price of electricity is impacted by several variables, including but not limited to, the price of fuels, generation resources in the region, weather, ongoing competition, emerging technologies, as well as macroeconomic and regulatory factors. The following table presents an average day-ahead around-the-clock reference price /MWh) for the periods presented for each of our major regions and does not necessarily reflect prices we ultimately realized.

 Effective income tax rates were 27.3 and 22.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 21.0 and 29.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is primarily due to tax effect of realized gains from qualified fund decommissioning activity, partially offset by nuclear PTC being inclusive in book income, which is not taxable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the change is primarily due to PTC being inclusive in book income, which is not taxable. See Note 8 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 All results included throughout the liquidity and capital resources section are presented on a GAAP basis. 
 Our operating and capital expenditures requirements are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations, the sale of certain receivables, as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and

 through bank borrowings. Our business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. We annually evaluate our financing plan and credit line sizing, focusing on maintaining our investment grade ratings while meeting our cash needs to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and OPEB obligations, and invest in new and existing ventures. A broad spectrum of financing alternatives beyond the core financing options can be used to meet our needs and fund growth, including monetizing assets in the portfolio via project financing, asset sales, and the use of other financing structures (e.g., joint ventures, minority partners, etc.). Our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions. See the Credit Matters and Cash Requirements section below for additional information. We expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs, and capital expenditure requirements. See Note 11 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt and credit agreements. 
 NRC Minimum Funding Requirements 
 NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient funds will be available in certain minimum amounts for radiological decommissioning of the facility. These NRC minimum funding levels are typically based upon the assumption that decommissioning activities will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit. If a unit fails the NRC minimum funding test, then the plant s owners or parent companies would be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through surety bonds, letters of credit, or parent company guarantees or making additional cash contributions to the NDT fund to ensure sufficient funds are available. See Note 7 Nuclear Decommissioning of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the latest funding status report filed with the NRC. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Crane NDT is fully funded under the SAFSTOR scenario that was the planned decommissioning option, as described in the Crane PSDAR filed with the NRC in April 2019. We will continue to file Crane's decommissioning funding status with the NRC annually until restart. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we have adequate NDT funds for the remaining radiological decommissioning costs at Zion Station related to the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation. Decommissioning costs other than radiological may require funding from us. See Liquidity and Capital Resources NRC Minimum Funding Requirements of our 2023 Form 10-K for information regarding the risk of additional financial assurance for shutdown units. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Our cash flows from operating activities include the sale of electric energy and energy-related products and sustainable solutions, and government assistance. Our future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by future demand for, and market prices of, energy and our ability to continue to produce and supply power at competitive costs, as well as to obtain collections from customers and the sale of certain receivables.

 Changes in our cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in results of operations, as adjusted by changes in working capital in the normal course of business, except as discussed below. Significant operating cash flow impacts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 In the third quarter of 2024, 670 million of cash was received related to the sale of nuclear PTCs. See Note 5 Government Assistance of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Depending upon whether we are in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position, collateral may be required to be posted with or collected from our counterparties. In addition, the collateral posting and collection requirements differ depending on whether the transactions are on an exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. See Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on collateral. 
 Option premiums received (paid), net relates to options contracts that we purchase and sell as part of our established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices. See Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivative contracts. 
 Increase in cash outflows for pension and non-pension postretirement benefit contributions is primarily due to our annual qualified pension contribution of 161 million and 21 million made in February 2024 and July 2023, respectively. See Note 9 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and non-pension postretirement benefit plans. 
 A net increase in cash outflows for changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in cash collections applied to DPP partially offset by an increase in ComEd CMC program activity and cash received in 2024 related to revenue for ZECs delivered in prior planning years. See Note 6 Accounts Receivable and Note 3 Revenue from Contracts with Customers of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 Credit Matters and Cash Requirements 
 We fund liquidity needs for capital expenditures, working capital, energy hedging and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper markets and large, diversified credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we have access to facilities with aggregate bank commitments of 7.5 billion. We had access to the commercial paper markets and had availability under our revolving credit facilities during the third quarter of 2024 to fund our short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. We routinely review the sufficiency of our liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. We closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising, and merger activity. See PART I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS of our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets. 
 We believe our cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets and our credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity to support the estimated future cash requirements discussed below. 
 If we had lost our investment grade credit rating as of September 30, 2024, we would have been required to provide incremental collateral estimated to be approximately 1.9 billion to meet collateral obligations for derivatives, non-derivatives, NPNS, and applicable payables and receivables, net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements. A loss of investment grade credit rating would have required a three notch downgrade by S P or Moody's from their current levels of BBB+ and Baa1, to BB+ and Ba1 or below, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had 5.1 billion of available capacity under our credit facilities and 1.8 billion of cash on hand. In the event of a credit downgrade below investment grade and a resulting requirement to provide incremental collateral exceeding available capacity under our credit facilities and cash on hand, we could be required to access additional liquidity through the capital markets. See Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 11 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
 We consider various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially-determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act, and management of the pension obligation. The Pension Protection Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). The contributions below reflect a funding strategy to improve funded status with the objective of achieving 100 funded status over time. Based on this funding strategy and current market conditions, which are both subject to change, our annual qualified pension contribution was made in February 2024 for 161 million. 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 Unlike the qualified pension plans, our non-qualified pension plans are not funded, given that they are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements. OPEB plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, though we have funded certain parts of our plans. For our funded OPEB plans, we consider several factors in determining the level of our contributions, including liabilities management and levels of benefit claims paid. The estimated benefit payments to the non-qualified pension plans in 2024 are approximately 23 million and the planned contributions to the OPEB plans, including estimated benefit payments to unfunded plans, is 16 million. Refer to ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Liquidity and Capital Resources of our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on pension and other postretirement benefits. 
 Cash Requirements for Other Financial Commitments 
 Refer to ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Liquidity and Capital Resources of our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on our cash requirements for financial commitments. 
 Sales of Customer Accounts Receivable 
 We have an accounts receivable financing facility with a number of financial institutions and a commercial paper conduit to sell certain receivables, which expires in August 2025 unless renewed by the mutual consent of the parties in accordance with its terms. See Note 6 Accounts Receivable of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Project Financing 
 Project financing is based upon a nonrecourse financial structure, in which project debt is paid back from the cash generated by a specific asset or portfolio of assets. Borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project. Lenders do not have recourse against us in the event of a default. If a project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific debt covenants, there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other project-related borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. In these instances, if such repayment were not satisfied, or restructured, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project-specific assets and related collateral. The potential requirement to repay the debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful lives. See Note 17 Debt and Credit Agreements of our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on project finance credit facilities and nonrecourse debt. 
 Credit Facilities 
 We meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. We may use our credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit. See Note 11 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our credit facilities. 
 Security Ratings 
 Our access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and our financing costs in those markets, may depend on our securities ratings. 
 Our borrowings are not subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrade of our securities, although such a downgrade could increase fees and interest charges under our credit agreements. 
 As part of the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contracts law, if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include the posting of additional collateral. See Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on collateral provisions.

 Our credit ratings from S P and Moody's are BBB+ and Baa1, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. In March 2024, Moody's raised our issuer credit rating to 'Baa1' from 'Baa2' citing confidence in our ability to maintain credit metrics and strong financial performance. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 (Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted) 
 We are exposed to market risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, counterparty credit, interest rates, and equity prices. We manage these risks through risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. We report risk management issues to the Executive Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The following discussion serves as an update to ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated herein by reference. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Commodity price risk is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather conditions, governmental, regulatory and environmental policies, and other factors. To the extent the total amount of energy we produce or procure differs from the amount of energy we have contracted to sell, we are exposed to market fluctuations in commodity prices. We seek to mitigate our commodity price risk through the sale and purchase of electricity, natural gas and oil, and other commodities. 
 Electricity available from our owned or contracted generation supply in excess of our obligations to customers is sold into the wholesale markets. To reduce commodity price risk caused by market fluctuations, we enter into non-derivative contracts as well as derivative contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards, and options, with approved counterparties to hedge anticipated exposures. We use derivative instruments as economic hedges to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. We expect the settlement of the majority of our economic hedges will occur during 2024 through 2026. 
 In general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on owned and contracted generation positions that have not been hedged. Beginning in 2024, our nuclear fleet is eligible for the nuclear PTC provided by the IRA, an important tool in managing commodity price risk for each nuclear unit not already receiving state support. The nuclear PTC provides increasing levels of support as unit revenues decline below levels established in the IRA and is further adjusted for inflation after 2024 through the duration of the program based on the GDP price deflator for the preceding calendar year. See Note 5 Government Assistance of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the nuclear PTC. 
 In locations and periods where our load serving activities do not naturally offset existing generation portfolio risk, remaining commodity price exposure is managed through portfolio hedging activities. Portfolio hedging activities are generally concentrated in the prompt three years, when customer demand and market liquidity enable effective price risk mitigation. During this prompt three-year period, we seek to mitigate the price risk associated with our load serving contracts, non-nuclear generation, and any residual price risk for our nuclear generation that the nuclear PTC and state programs may not fully mitigate. We also enter transactions that further optimize the economic benefits of our overall portfolio. 
 The forecasted market price risk exposure is the risk of a change in the value of unhedged positions. The forecasted market price risk exposure for our entire economic hedge portfolio associated with a 5/MWh reduction in the annual average around-the-clock energy price based on September 30, 2024 market conditions and hedged position results in an immaterial impact to net income (loss) for 2024 and 2025, respectively, largely due to the nuclear PTC. See Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 Fuel Procurement 
 We procure natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts, and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, including contracts sourced from Russia, and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make our procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices. We engage a diverse set of suppliers to ensure we can secure the nuclear fuel needed to continue to operate our nuclear fleet long-term. Approximately 45 of our uranium concentrate requirements for the remainder of 2024 through 2029 are supplied by three suppliers. To-date, we have not experienced any counterparty credit risk associated with these suppliers stemming from the Russia and Ukraine conflict. In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, we believe that replacement uranium concentrate can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Geopolitical developments, including the Russia and Ukraine conflict and United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Canadian sanctions against Russia, have the potential to impact delivery from multiple suppliers in the international uranium processing industry. Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. To-date, we have not experienced any delivery or non-performance issues from our suppliers, nor any degradation in the quality of fuel we have received, and we are closely monitoring developments from the conflict. See ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Other Key Business Drivers for more information on the Russia and Ukraine conflict.

 Credit Risk 
 We would be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties that execute derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date. See Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of credit risk. 
 Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features 
 As part of the normal course of business, we routinely enter into physically or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electric capacity, electricity, fuels, emissions allowances, and other energy-related products. In accordance with the contracts and applicable law, if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on our net position with a counterparty, the demand could be for the posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. See Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash collateral. 
 We transact output through bilateral contracts. The bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations. Any failure to collect these payments from counterparties could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As market prices rise above or fall below contracted price levels, we are required to post collateral with purchasers; as market prices fall below contracted price levels, counterparties are required to post collateral with us. To post collateral, we depend on access to bank credit facilities, which serve as liquidity sources to fund collateral requirements. See ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Matters and Cash Requirements Credit Facilities for additional information.

 RTOs and ISOs 
 We participate in all of the established wholesale energy markets that are administered by PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO, CAISO, MISO, SPP, AESO, and ERCOT. ERCOT is not subject to regulation by FERC but performs a similar function in Texas to that performed by RTOs and ISOs in markets regulated by FERC. In these areas, power and related products are traded through bilateral agreements between buyers and sellers and in the energy markets that are administered by the RTOs or ISOs, as applicable. In areas where there is no RTO or ISO to administer energy markets, electricity and related products are purchased and sold solely through bilateral agreements. For activity administered by an RTO or ISO, the RTO or ISO maintains financial assurance policies that are established and enforced by those administrators. The credit policies of the RTOs and ISOs may, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member be shared by the remaining participants. Non-performance or non-payment by a major member of an RTO or ISO could result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Exchange Traded Transactions 
 We enter into commodity transactions on NYMEX, ICE, NASDAQ, NGX, and the Nodal exchange (each an Exchange and, collectively, Exchanges). The Exchange clearinghouses act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the Exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, transactions on Exchanges are significantly collateralized and have limited counterparty credit risk. 
 Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk 
 We use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. We may also utilize interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate exposure. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in the interest rates associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and fixed-to-floating swaps would not have resulted in a material decrease in our pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we utilize foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges. See Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Equity Price Risk 
 We maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund the costs of decommissioning our nuclear plants. Our NDT funds are reflected at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate us for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs; however, the equity securities in the trust funds are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets, and the value of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. We actively monitor the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically review asset allocations in accordance with our NDT fund investment policy. 
 A hypothetical 25 basis points increase in interest rates and 10 decrease in equity prices would have resulted in a 977 million reduction in the fair value of our NDT trust assets as of September 30, 2024. This calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates and equity prices. See Note 7 Nuclear Decommissioning of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources section of ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for additional information. 
 Our employee benefit plan trusts also hold investments in equity and debt securities. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates of our 2023 Form 10-K for further information.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 During the third quarter of 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures related to the recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting of information in periodic reports that we file or submit with the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that (a) information relating to our consolidated subsidiaries, is accumulated and made known to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, by other employees as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (b) this information is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people. 
 Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We continually strive to improve our disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of our financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant. There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any of our internal control over financial reporting.
