 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

at September 30, 2024 . For the nine -months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized a net loss of , and cash and cash equivalents decreased by from at December 31, 2023 to at September 30, 2024 . The Company intends to fund its operations over the next twelve months from planned sales of non-strategic assets and other investments, issuance of the equity under our existing shelf registration statement and private placements, issuance of subsidiary-level equity, planned licensing and related engineering services from our fuels business, sales and deferred revenue from our solar panel recycling business and existing cash and cash equivalents. Based on these expected funding sources, management believes the Company will have sufficient funds to sustain our operations and meet our contractual and investment commitments during the 12 months following the date of issuance of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. While the Company has been successful in the past in obtaining the necessary capital to support our operations, including registered equity financings from our existing shelf registration statement, borrowings, asset sales and other means, there is no assurance the Company will be able to sell additional assets timely and/or obtain additional equity capital or other financing, if needed. Risks to our liquidity include future operating expenditures above management s expectations, including but not limited to exploration, pre-development, research and development, selling, general and administrative, investment related expenditures, the sale of the Silver Springs Properties, and amounts to be raised from the issuance of equity under our existing shelf registration statement or non-registered equity issued directly from certain subsidiaries. Declines in the share price of our common stock would also adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and available liquidity. If the Company is unable to obtain any necessary additional funds, this could have an immediate material adverse effect on liquidity and raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In such case, the Company could be required to limit or discontinue certain business plans, activities, or operations, reduce or delay certain capital expenditures or investments, or sell certain assets or businesses. There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to take any such actions on favorable terms, in a timely manner, or at all.

Other Investment On March 1, 2024, the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreement (the Developer Securities Purchase Agreement with an unaffiliated research and development company Developer under which the Company agreed to purchase 4,000,000 shares of common stock of the Developer, corresponding to 40 of Developer's fully-diluted issued and outstanding capital stock, for 1,500,000. Concurrently and in connection with the entity into the Developer Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company and Developer entered into Development Services Agreement DSA for purposes of conducting certain research and development work. The purchase price payable by the Company pursuant to the Developer Securities Purchase Agreement is scheduled to be paid on the following schedule:

After completion of Phase 1 

30,000 per month until fully paid; and

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Three-Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three-Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenues for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 204,338 to 556,383 from 760,721 for the comparable 2023 period, primarily due to lower revenues from the ABTC lease of 237,473 and lower revenues from the Mackay mineral lease of 100,000, partially offset by revenues from Comstock Metals of 128,558. 
 
 Revenue and costs of sales in future periods will vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including the amount of solar panels that we recycle and the amount of renewable energy technology solutions that we license and sell, lease revenues on our properties, the market prices for those services, the extent to which we secure and collect reasonable royalties, the degree to which we can provide event-driven engineering services, and the costs associated with each component of the aforementioned revenues. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 36,293 to 3,176,373 from 3,140,080 in the comparable 2023 period, primarily as a result of higher consulting expense of 259,878, higher share-based compensation of 214,778, and higher rent expense of 181,931; partially offset by lower employee costs of 325,478 attributed to lower incentive compensation and lower bad debt expense of 240,000 attributed to the 2023 impairment of a Fenix deposit. 
 
 Research and development expenses for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 45,507 to 1,440,367 from 1,394,860 in the comparable 2023 period. The increase is primarily related to higher costs for processing crushing and separating electrification products of 309,427; offset partially by lower employee costs of 215,965 for salaries and incentive compensation. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 114,323 to 562,456 from 676,779 in the comparable 2023 period. The decrease is primarily related to lower amortization for impaired intangible assets in 2024. 
 
 Impairment of intangible assets and properties, plant and equipment assets for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 of 8,667,869 and 324,047, respectively, was attributed to the impairment of intangible assets and equipment in 2024 (see Note 4, Properties, Plant and Equipment, Net and Mineral Rights and Note 5, Intangible Assets ). 
 
 In 2023, we recognized a gain on the sale of the Facility of 7,126,377, with no comparable amount in 2024. 
 
 Gain on investments for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 14,074,875 to 0 from 14,074,875 in the comparable 2023 period. The decrease is primarily related to the 2023 realized gain of 597,248 on the sale of 1,500 shares of our Green Li-ion investment and the adjusted fair value unrealized gain of 14,577,627 recorded on the remaining 35,662 Green Li-ion preferred shares at 530.34 per share; offset by 1,100,000 in loss on the ABTC investment as we sold 9,076,923 ABTC shares for the three-months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable amount in 2024. 
 
 Interest expense for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 376,181 to 696,996 from 320,815 in the comparable 2023 period, primarily due to higher interest and higher amortization of the original issue discount OID on the 2023 Kips Bay Note and 2023 Alvin Fund Note originating in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the 2024 Leviston Note and 2024 Kips Bay Note originating in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Interest income for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 7,948 to 81,015 from 73,067 in the comparable 2023 period, primarily due to higher interest income related to our cash sweep account. 
 
 Change in the fair value of our derivative instruments for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3,719,546 to a gain of 1,350,370 from a loss of 2,369,176 in the comparable 2023 period, as a result of an increase in the Company's share price in connection with potential make-whole obligations for minimum value commitments on the Company's common shares. The 2024 gain was attributed to gain of 8,575 for the LINICO investment, gain of 927,000 for the Haywood investment, gain of 404,794 on the derivative liability for 2023 Kips Bay Note and gain of 130,000 for the 2024 Leviston Note; partially offset by a loss of 120,000 for the 2024 Kips Bay Note. The loss from the three-months ended September 30, 2023 was attributed to 1,120,000 for the LINICO investment, 845,843 for the GenMat investment and 480,000 for the Haywood investment, partially offset by a gain of 76,667 on the derivative liability for Ionic Note. 
 
 Loss of 2,218,694 on the conversion of debt to equity for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 is attributed to the 2023 Kips Bay Note and 2024 Leviston Note debt conversions associated with 7,891,480 and 24,680,175, respectively, of the Company's common shares issued for the conversion of the debt during the three-months ended September 30, 2024. Gain of 289,512 on the conversion of debt to equity for the three-months ended September 30, 2023 was attributed to the Ionic Note debt conversions associated with 2,818,714 of the Company's common shares used for the conversion during the three-months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Loss on debt extinguishment of 222,634 resulted from the Company using cash to redeem 500,000 of principal on the 2023 Kips Bay Note at a 10 redemption premium totaling 50,000 and loss on debt extinguishment of 172,634. 
 
 Other income (expense), net for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 were 327,085, primarily consisting of unrealized gain on fair value change of GenMat advances of 776,656, partially offset by losses from our equity method investments of 449,883 substantially all of which were from GenMat.

 OUTLOOK 
 
 Our goal is to Accelerate the Commercialization of Hard Technologies for the Energy Transition. We are pushing the boundaries of what is possible in technology and sustainability by leveraging our teams unique skills, our diverse technology portfolio and our frontier research and development networks toward achieving breakthrough innovations that deliver meaningful positive impact across industries, economies and communities. The primary focus for 2024 is the commercialization and capitalization of our businesses and the continuous innovation, development, engineering and actionable commercialization of our technologies and solutions. 
 
 Technology Readiness 
 
 The Company s biorefining technologies are commercially ready and offer growth-enabling performance for the Company s prospective customers. Comstock Fuels is actively engaged in the planning and deployment of our first commercial demonstration facility and pursuing joint development and licensing agreements representing strategic capital and future revenue sources from technical and engineering services, including securing associated supply chain participants, performing preliminary and final engineering, facilitating commissioning, construction and operations with globally recognized current and developing renewable fuel producers. 
 
 Comstock Metals is also commercially ready and has constructed and commissioned its first commercial demonstration facility. The facility is operating on one shift and is currently expanding to three shifts over the next two to three months. Site selection, design and permitting is currently underway for the first Industry Scale photovoltaic recycling facility and related storage capacity. Industry Scale facilities are anticipated to scale up to 15-20 times the capacity of the operating demonstration facility (that is, from approximately 5,000-7,000 tons per annum of capacity for the demonstration facility up to 100,000 tons per annum of capacity for Industry Scale). 
 
 Regional site assessment and selection activities are ongoing for the next two facilities. 
 
 Comstock s team has decades of diverse technology development and commercialization experience. The Company uses a disciplined approach to devising, qualifying, and elevating innovations from conception through increasing degrees of commercial readiness. The Company has adopted a widely used Technology Readiness Level TRL measurement system for objectively assessing Comstock s progress, risks, investment qualifications, and commercial maturity. 
 
 There are nine readiness levels on the TRL scale, starting with TRL 1. Progression up the scale requires achievement of SMART milestones that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely. Proof of concept occurs at TRL 3. TRL 4 and 5 involve increasing degrees of process validation. TRL 6 is the first true demonstration of commercial readiness. TRL 7 and 8 involve various functional prototypes and pilots with increasing fidelity and sophistication. A TRL 9 technology is commercially mature and fully deployed. Depending on the technology and other applicable factors, revenue can commence at TRL 6 for early adopting and generally sophisticated commercial clients with continued development to TRL 7, 8, and 9. 
 
 Each of our lines of developing businesses have achieved sufficiency for certain aspects of their technology readiness enabling early adoption and commercialization efforts. 
 
 The following summarizes the recent change in TRL status, and the 2024 objectives:

Commercialization Lines of Business 
 
 Comstock Fuels 
 
 Most current forms of renewable fuel draw from the same pool of conventional feedstocks, including corn and vegetable oils in the U.S., but the entire available supply of those feedstocks could only meet a small fraction of the rapidly growing demand for renewable fuels. Comstock's patented and patent-pending biorefining technologies unblock that constraint by converting underutilized lignocellulosic or "woody" biomass into biointermediates for refining drop-in and other renewable fuels. 
 
 Comstock Fuel s objectives for the fourth quarter of 2024 include: 

Execute multiple, revenue generating commercial agreements for industry-scale joint developments; 

Advancing and expanding our innovation network for even higher yields and lower costs; and 

Expand our integrated bio-intermediate production system, including cellulosic ethanol and HBO. 

Additionally, closing on the 200 million SBCC direct equity and/or debt financing, enables our first commercial demonstration facility which is designed to be profitable and to confirm the scale of multiple industry facilities. Then, the Company plans to build its own, three U.S. based industrial scale facilities designed for inputs of up to 1 million tons per year of woody biomass feedstock and producing up to 125 million GGE of advanced biofuels, including renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels. Our commercialization plans also includes multiple, global joint development projects, with each joint development project, like SACL, with the potential for generating in millions of dollars of technical services and engineering revenues and license agreements for additional production facilities that generate royalty revenues. 
 
 Comstock Metals 
 
 End of life solar panels are one of the primary metals-based products that can cause a massive amount of pollution if simply allowed to be landfilled at the end of life with no recovery of any of the underlying metal values. 
 
 Comstock Metal s objectives for the fourth quarter of 2024 include: 

Commencing full, three-shift production of the demonstration scale production facility; 

Confirming the ongoing ability to fully and cleanly reprocess and reuse all residual materials; 

Advancing the technology readiness for broader material recycling, prioritizing photovoltaics, to TRL 7; 

Expanding our existing revenue generating decommissioning, supply and offtake commitments; and 

Commencing permitting for our first industry-scale facility in Silver Springs, NV. 

Comstock Metals is operating its demonstration scale production facility in Silver Springs, NV, and has also secured the initial county level permits for industry-scale operations and storage and is actively engaged in garnering expanded revenue generating supply. Additionally, closing on the 22 million direct equity and/or debt financing, accelerates the deployment of the next two commercial demonstration facilities. Comstock Metals is also further expanding our business into decommissioning services both as a revenue generator and a feeder for our recycling business, and establishing markets for the sale of residual material including aluminum, glass and silver. 
 
 Comstock Mining 
 
 The Company has amassed the single largest known repository of historical and current geological data within the Comstock mineral district, including extensive geophysical surveys, geological mapping, and drilling data, including the Dayton resource. 
 
 On June 30, 2023, the Company signed a Mineral Exploration and Mining Lease Agreement (the Mining Lease with Mackay. Mackay paid a lease initiation fee of 1,250,000 and made additional, quarterly lease payments to date totaling approximately 2,000,000. 
 
 The Company s objectives for the fourth quarter of 2024 include: 

Receive cash proceeds of more than 2 million from mineral leases and asset sales leveraging the northern district claims; 

Commercialize mineral development agreements that enable resource expansion of the central district claims; and 

Complete the preliminary mine plans that enables the economic development of the southern district claims. 

The Company s 2024 efforts apply economic analysis to Comstock s existing gold and silver resources progressing toward preliminary economic feasibility for the southern part of the district and the ultimate development of full mine and reclamation plans and the development of post productive land and community development plans. Additionally, closing on the SBCC 50 million direct equity and/or debt financing, accelerates the development of the Dayton mine plan, broader resource expansions for the southern district claims and the design and engineering of the post productive real estate and community development plans. 
 
 Strategic Investments 
 
 Investment in GenMat 
 
 Investment in physics-based AI is a meaningful component of Comstock s technology innovation strategy. GenMat develops and commercializes proprietary material science based artificial intelligence models for the discovery and manipulation of matter. This includes AI models that can be employed today, for commercial use on GenMat s existing, high-performance computing platforms. Comstock has a minority investment interest in GenMat.

We intend to fund our operations over the next twelve months from planned sales of non-strategic assets and other investments, issuance of equity under our existing shelf registration statement and private placements, issuance of subsidiary-level equity, planned licensing and related engineering services, sales and deferred revenue from our solar panel recycling business and existing cash and cash equivalents. Based on these expected funding sources, management believes we will have sufficient funds to sustain our operations and meet our commitments under our investment agreements during the 12 months following the date of issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. While we have been successful in the past in obtaining the necessary capital to support our operations, including registered equity financings from our existing shelf registration statement, non-registered equity placements, non-registered equity issued directly from certain subsidiaries, borrowings, and various other means. There is no assurance we will be able to obtain additional equity capital or other financing, if needed. We intend to fund our operations beyond the next twelve months from planned sales of non-strategic assets, sales from our solar panel recycling operations, sales from licensing our lignocellulosic technology and related engineering services, issuance of subsidiary-level equity, and borrowings and other various equity financing alternatives from our existing shelf and other registration statements. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1,565,999 to 9,617,985 from 11,183,984 in the comparable 2023 period, due primarily to decreases in operating expenses and increases in sources of cash from working capital, primarily increases in accounts payable, discussed in Financial Condition and Results of Operating Information. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 was 6,862,660, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 6,457,386 in the comparable 2023 period, resulting in a 13,320,046 change, primarily due to proceeds received in 2023 from sale of AQMS lease and related assets of 21.0 million offset by purchase of the facility of 12.0 million. Decrease attributed to proceeds received in 2023 for the sale of ABTC shares of 5,365,981 with no sales in 2024, funding of RenFuel note of 1,350,000, advances to GenMat of 1,235,636, proceeds from sale of Green Li-ion shares in 2023 of 779,600 and investment in SSOF of 530,000; partially offset by lower make-whole payments for our investments of 3,160,636, lower advances to SSOF of 1,470,000 and lower purchase of mineral rights and property, plant and equipment of 710,604. 
 
 Net cash provided in financing activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8,413,484 to 14,058,395 from 5,644,911 for the comparable 2023 period, primarily as a result of additional funding from the 2023 Kips Bay Note, 2024 Leviston Note and the 2024 Kips Bay Note of 2,000,000, 2,500,000 and 3,500,000, respectively. Increase also due to an increase in proceeds from issuance of common stock of 863,710. 
 
 Risks to our liquidity could result from future operating expenditures above management s expectations, including but not limited to pre-development, research and development, exploration, selling, general and administrative, and investment related expenditures in excess of sale proceeds from our non-strategic assets and other investments, amounts to be raised from direct equity from our subsidiaries or the issuance of equity under our existing shelf registration statement or amounts to be raised directly from the non-registered equity of our subsidiaries, declines in the market value of properties planned for sale, or declines in the share price of our common stock that would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If we were unable to obtain any necessary additional funds, this could have an immediate material adverse effect on liquidity and raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In such case, we could be required to limit or discontinue certain business plans, activities or operations, reduce or delay certain capital expenditures or investments, or sell certain assets or businesses. There can be no assurance that we would be able to take any such actions on favorable terms, in a timely manner, or at all.

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market Prices 
 
 Changes in the market price of commodities, including precious metals, critical metals and oil and gas may significantly affect our future profitability and cash flow. Metal prices fluctuate widely due to factors such as: demand, global mine production levels, supply chain constraints, investor sentiment, central bank reserves, global conflicts and the value of the U.S. dollar and other currencies. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The interest rates on our existing long-term debt borrowings are fixed, and as a result, interest due on borrowings are not impacted by changes in market-based interest rates. 
 
 There have been no material changes in the market risks discussed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 A. Disclosure 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, with the participation of both our Principal Executive and Financial Officer and our Principal Accounting Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") was conducted. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Exchange Act rules, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, including controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us is accumulated and communicated to our management (including our chief executive officer), were effective as of September 30, 2024, in assuring them in a timely manner that material information required to be disclosed in this report has been properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The Company s business activities, including cellulosic fuels, battery recycling, storage, mining, and exploration, are subject to various laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations are frequently changing and generally becoming more restrictive. The Company believes its operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations, in all material respects and continuously spends money to comply with such laws and regulations and cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. 
 
 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 
 
 Our investors should consider the risks set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that could affect our business. Additionally, investors should consider the following risk factors identified since the filing of our Annual Report. 
 
 Our plans to expand our revenue sources through commercializing our market-ready technologies and developing new technology with commercial applicability may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results. 
 
 As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to expand our revenue sources through the continued development, commercialization and licensing of technology projects. Our technology development activities may experience delays, or the markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect, each of which could reduce our opportunities for technology sales and licensing. In addition, there could be fewer applications for our technology and products than we expect. The development of technology markets also could be affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, infrastructure improvements. Additionally, investing in technology development is costly and may require structural changes to the organization that could require additional costs, including without limitation legal and accounting fees. Furthermore, delays or failures to enter into additional partnering relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failures to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows, or decrease our ability to remain competitive. In addition, the commercialization of certain technologies could potentially lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could limit our ability to derive licensing revenue from certain patents under our patent licensing program. In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. 
 
 We face risks from doing business in international markets. 
 
 A significant portion of our licensees, potential licensees and customers are international, and our licensees, potential licensees and customers sell their products to markets throughout the world. Accordingly, we could be subject to the effects of a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; biased enforcement of foreign laws and regulations to promote industrial or economic policies at our expense; currency control regulations and variability in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currency; social, economic and political instability; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; and general delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments. In addition, we also are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we and our licensees, potential licensees and customers do business. 
 
 Our current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control. 
 
 We have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that plan to produce and sell products requiring specialized expertise. We have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties certain rights to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas outside of the United States. In the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. Although we take steps to carefully select our licensing partners, such arrangements may not be successful. Our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the timing of new store openings, the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. In addition, the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partner s ability to: 

obtain capital; 

exercise operational and financial control over its business; 

manage its labor relations; 

maintain relationships with suppliers; 

manage its credit and bankruptcy risks; and 

maintain customer relationships. 

Any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements.

Exhibit 95 

The following disclosures are provided pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, which requires certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). 

Whenever the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA believes that a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard, or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation or order which describes the violation and fixes a time within which the operator must abate the violation. In some situations, such as when the MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to persons, MSHA may issue an order requiring removal of persons from the area of the mine affected by the condition until the hazards are corrected. Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it has authority to propose a civil penalty or fine, as a result of the violation. 

The table below reflects citations and orders issued by MSHA during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 .
