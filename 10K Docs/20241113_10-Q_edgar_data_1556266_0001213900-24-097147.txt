months. The Company considers renewal or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised
when determining the lease term and the initial measurement of right of use assets and lease liabilities. The amortization of right of
use assets for lease payment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less
are not recorded on the balance sheet. 

The Company determines whether a contract is,
or contains, a lease at inception of the contract and whether that lease meets the classification criteria of a finance or operating lease.
When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value; however, most of the Company s
leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company discounts lease payments based on an estimate of its
incremental borrowing rate. 

The Company s lease agreements do not contain
any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

. Under the PRC tax law, companies are required to make quarterly
estimate payments based on tax rate; companies that received preferential tax rates are also required to use a tax rate for their
installment tax payments. The overpayment, however, will not be refunded and can only be used to offset future tax liabilities. 

The Company evaluates the level of authority for
each uncertain tax position (including the potential application of interest and penalties) based on the technical merits and measures
the unrecognized benefits associated with the tax positions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had no unrecognized
tax benefits. Due to uncertainties surrounding future utilization, the Company estimates there will not be sufficient future income to
realize the deferred tax assets for certain subsidiaries and a VIE. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had deferred
tax assets of and , respectively. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The Company does not anticipate any significant
increase in its liability for unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months. The Company will classify interest and penalties related
to income tax matters, if any, in income tax expense. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company
had current income tax expenses of and , respectively, and deferred income tax expense of and benefit of
 in the connection of intangible assets generated from acquisitions. 

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income
taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for
recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the
largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions
are recognized and recorded as necessary in the provision for income taxes. The Company is subject to income taxes in the PRC. According
to the PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law, the statute of limitations is three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to computational
errors made by the taxpayer or the withholding agent. The statute of limitations is extended to five years under special circumstances,
where the underpayment of taxes is more than RMB . In the case of transfer pricing issues, the statute of limitation is ten years.
There is no statute of limitation in the case of tax evasion. There were no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, and the Company does not believe that its unrecognized tax benefits will change over the next twelve months.

was primarily deposited in financial institutions located in Mainland China, which were uninsured by the government authority.
To limit exposure to credit risk relating to deposits, the Company primarily place cash deposits with large financial institutions in
China, which management believes are of high credit quality. The Company considers the credit standing of customers when making sales
to manage the credit risk. Considering the nature of the business at current, the Company believes that the credit risk is not material
to its operations. 

The Company s operations are carried out
in Mainland China. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political,
economic and legal environments in the PRC as well as by the general state of the PRC s economy. In addition, the Company s
business may be influenced by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency
conversion and remittance abroad, rates and methods of taxation, and the extraction of mining resources, among other factors. 

(2) Liquidity risk 

The Company is also exposed to liquidity risk
which is the risk that it is unable to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs.
Liquidity risk is controlled by the application of financial position analysis and monitoring procedures. When necessary, the Company
will turn to other financial institutions and the owners to obtain short-term funding to meet the liquidity shortage. 

(3) Foreign currency risk 

Substantially all of the Company s operating
activities and the Company s major assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB, which is not freely convertible into foreign currencies.
All foreign exchange transactions take place either through the Peoples Bank of China PBOC or other authorized
financial institutions at exchange rates quoted by PBOC. Approval of foreign currency payments by the PBOC or other regulatory institutions
requires submitting a payment application form together with suppliers invoices and signed contracts. 

The value of RMB is subject to changes in central
government policies and to international economic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the China Foreign Exchange
Trading System market. Where there is a significant change in value of RMB, the gains and losses resulting from translation of financial
statements of a foreign subsidiary will be significantly affected. 

20 

(4) Economic and political risks 

The Company s operations are conducted in
the PRC. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political,
economic and legal environment in the PRC, and by the general state of the PRC economy. 

(5) Risks related to industry 

The Company sells precious products to customers
through our industrial relationship. Sales contracts are entered into with each customer. The Company is the principal under the precious
metal direct sales model as the Company controls the products with the ability to direct the use of, and obtain all the remaining benefits
from the precious metal products substantially before they are sold to its customers. The Company has a single performance obligation
to sell metal products to the buyers. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration, including sales return using the expected
value method and includes variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal
will not occur. Revenue for precious metal trading under the direct sales model is recognized at a point in time when the single performance
obligation is satisfied when the products are delivered to the customer. We are under the risk of the economic environment in general
and specific to the precious metal industry and China as well as changes to the existing governmental regulations. 

Commodity trading in China is subject to seasonal
fluctuations, which may cause our revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We generally experience less user traffic and purchase
orders during national holidays in China, particularly during the Chinese New Year holiday season in the first quarter of each year. Consequently,
the first quarter of each calendar year generally contributes the smallest portion of our annual revenues. Furthermore, as we are substantially
dependent on sales of precious metals, our quarterly revenues and results of operations are likely to be affected by price fluctuation
under macroeconomic circumstances these years. 

As our revenues have grown rapidly in recent years,
these factors are difficult to discern based on our historical results, which, therefore, should not be relied on to predict our future
performance. Our financial condition and results of operations for future periods may continue to fluctuate. As a result, the trading
price of our stock may fluctuate from time to time due to seasonality.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company primarily
had two business lines, which are the commodities trading business and supply chain management services. 

Commodities trading business 

The commodities trading business primarily involves
purchasing non-ferrous metal products, such as aluminum ingots, copper, silver, and gold, from metal and mineral suppliers and then selling
to customers. In connection with the Company s commodity sales, in order to help customers to obtain sufficient funds to purchase
various metal products and also help upstream metal and mineral suppliers to sell their metal products, the Company launched its supply
chain management service in December 2019. The Company primarily generates revenues from selling bulk non-ferrous commodity products and
providing related supply chain management services in the PRC. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded
revenue of 91,714,259 from its commodities trading business and 2,811 from its supply chain management services, respectively. 

The Company sources bulk commodity products from
non-ferrous metal and mines or its designated distributors and then sells to manufacturers who need these metals in large quantities.
The Company works with suppliers in the sourcing of commodities. Major suppliers include various metal and mineral suppliers such as Kunsteel
Group, Baosteel Group, Aluminum Corporate of China Limited, Yunnan Benyuan, Yunnan Tin, and Shanghai Copper. The Company s target
customers include large infrastructure companies such as China National Electricity, Datang Power, China Aluminum Foshan International
Trade, Tooke Investment (China), CSSC International Trade Co., Ltd., Shenye Group, and Keliyuan. 

Supply Chain Management Services 

We offer a distribution service to bulk suppliers of precious metals
by acting as a sales intermediary, procuring small to medium-sized buyers through our own professional sales team and channels and distributing
the bulk precious metals of the suppliers. Upon executing a purchase order from our sourced buyers, we charge the suppliers a commission
fee ranging from 1 to 2 of the distribution order, depending on the size of the order. We also offer some other supply chain management
services business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated revenue from supply chain management services of
 2,811 from three third-party customers, compared with a commodity distribution services revenue of 64,037 with four third-party customers
for the same period in 2023. 

Competition 

The Company mainly competes against other large
domestic commodity metal product trading service providers such as Xiamen International Trade and Yijian Shares. Currently, the principal
competitive factors in the non-ferrous metal commodities trading business are price, product availability, quantity, service, and financing
terms for purchases and sales of commodities. 

Applicable Government Regulations 

Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng has obtained all material
approvals, permits, licenses and certificates required for our metal product trading operations, including registrations from the local
business and administrative department authorizing the purchase of raw materials. 

Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operation 

The commodities trading industry has been experiencing
decreasing demand as a result of China s overall economic slowdown. We expect competition in the commodities trading business to
persist and intensify. 

We commenced our commodities trading business
in late November 2019. Over the past five years, we have expanded our operations and diversified our product offerings. Our future success
depends on our ability to sustain growth and maintain profitability. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our
business and future prospects. Our future prospects may face risks and challenges typically encountered by a company with a limited operating
history in an emerging and rapidly evolving industry, including, among other things, 

Profitability : Maintaining and enhancing our profitability through efficient operations and cost management; 

Competitive Position : Strengthening our competitive position in the commodities trading industry in China by leveraging our established networks and market knowledge. 

22 

Strategic Implementation : Effectively implementing our growth strategies and adapting to market competition and customer preferences, including potential expansion into new geographical markets.; and 

Human Resources : Successfully recruiting, training, and retaining qualified managerial and other personnel to support our growth and operational needs. 

Our business requires a significant amount of
capital, particularly for the purchase of bulk commodities and expansion into new markets where we currently do not have operations. We
continue to seek opportunities to optimize our operations, improve financial performance, and manage risks associated with our business.

Revenue 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenue
from the following two sources, including (1) revenue from sales of commodity products, and
(2) revenue from supply chain management services. Total revenue increased by 3,250,310 or 10 , from 33,911,726 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023 to 37,162,036 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, among which revenue from commodity trading and
supply chain management accounted for 99.99 and 0.01 of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase
was mainly driven by an expanded our customer base and favorable pricing conditions in the commodities market. 

(1) 
 Revenue from sales of commodity products 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company sold non-ferrous metals to fourteen third-party customers at fixed prices compared with thirteen third-party customers for
the same period in 2023, and earned revenues when the product ownership was transferred to its customers. The Company earned revenues
of 37,162,036 from sales of commodity products for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 33,883,096 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 3,278,940, or 10 . This increase was primarily due to the Company s expanded
customer base, growing from thirteen to fourteen third-party customers, along with an increase in the sales volume of non-ferrous metals. 

(2) 
 Revenue from supply chain management services 

In connection
with the Company s commodity sales, in order to help customers to obtain sufficient funds to purchase various metal products and
also help metal and mineral suppliers sell their metal products, the Company launched its supply chain management service business in
December 2019, which primarily consisted of loan recommendation services and commodity distribution services. For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company provided nil commodity distribution services and other related services to third-party customers, compared
with 28,630 provided to the third-party customers for the same period ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due
to the Company s ongoing business plan to expand into electric vehicle industry, resulting in reduction in commodity distribution
services to third-party customers. 

Cost of revenue 

Our cost of revenue primarily includes the cost
of revenue associated with commodity product sales and the cost of revenue associated with management services of the supply chain. Total
cost of revenue increased by 3,285,187 or 10 from 33,934,963 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 37,220,150 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024. The increased cost of revenue is in line with the increase in revenue. 

Cost of revenue associated with commodity trading 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company purchased non-ferrous metal products of 37,220,150 from 11 third-party vendors. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023,
the Company purchased non-ferrous metal products of 33,916,806 from 11 third-party vendors. 

24 

Selling, general, and administrative expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
from 3,034,313 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2,416,176 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing
a decrease of 618,137, or 20 . Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of salary and employee benefits, office
rental expenses, amortizations of intangible assets and convertible notes, professional service fees and finance offering related fees.
The decrease was mainly attributable to cost-reduction initiatives and improved operational efficiencies implemented during the period. 

Interest income 

Interest income was primarily generated from loans
made to third parties and related parties. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income was 7,354,682 representing
an increase of 2,229,954, or 44 from 5,124,728 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the growth of
loans made to third party vendors for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The balance of loan receivables was 301,335,694 as of
September 30, 2024 which was 99.38 million higher than that as of September 30, 2023. 

Amortization of beneficial conversion feature
and relative fair value of warrants relating to convertible promissory notes 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
the item represented the amortization of beneficial conversion feature of nil relating to the convertible promissory notes. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023,
the item represented the amortization of beneficial conversion feature of 228,250 relating to the
convertible promissory notes. 

Net income (loss) 

As a result of the foregoing, net income for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 was 3,173,257, representing an increase of 2,493,599 from 679,658 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Revenue 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generate revenue from
the following two sources, including (1) revenue from sales of commodity products, and (2) revenue from supply chain management services.
Total revenue decreased by 11,284,590 or 11 , from 103,001,660 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 91,717,070 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, among which revenue from sales of commodity products and supply chain management accounted for 99.99 
and 0.01 , respectively. The decrease was mainly affected by the market environment: the
industry was in a situation of both weak supply and weak demand, and the internal competition was also fierce. 

(1) 
 Revenue from sales of commodity products 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company sold non-ferrous metals to fourteen third-party customers at fixed prices compared with thirteen third-party customers for
the same period in 2023, and earned revenues when the product ownership was transferred to its customers. The Company earned revenues
of 91,714,259 from sales of commodity products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 102,937,623 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, with a decrease of 11,223,364 or 11 . The decrease of revenue from sales of commodity products is mainly due
to the decrease in the average unit sales price of zinc ingots from 3.32 per kilogram for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to
 2.76 per kilogram for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. And based on a downward trend in FY2024, the annual consumption of zinc
plating in China is declining year by year. 

(2) 
 Revenue from supply chain management services 

In connection with the Company s commodity
sales, in order to help customers to obtain sufficient funds to purchase various metal products and also help upstream metal and mineral
suppliers sell their metal products, the Company launched its supply chain management service business in December 2019, which primarily
consisted of loan recommendation services and distribution services. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded
revenue of 2,811 from supply chain management services to third-party customers compared with 64,037 to third-party customers for the
same period in 2023. The decrease in revenue from sales of commodity products is mainly due to the downsizing of the zinc plating market,
as well as less customers in the fierce competition. 

Cost of revenue 

Our cost of revenue primarily includes the cost

nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decreased cost of revenue is in line with the decrease

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
from 14,108,225 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 7,487,247 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing
a decrease of 6,620,978, or 47 . Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of salary and employee benefits, office
rental expenses, amortizations of intangible assets and convertible notes, professional service fees and finance offering related fees.
 The decrease was mainly attributable to stock-based compensation expenses of 5,698,000 resulting
from the issuance of a total of 11,000,000 shares of common stock to service providers for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in
comparison to zero in such expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

made to third parties and related parties. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income was 20,113,780 representing
an increase of 5,631,764, or 39 from 14,482,016 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the growth of
loans made to third party vendors for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Amortization of beneficial conversion feature
and relative fair value of warrants relating to convertible promissory notes 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the item represented the amortization of beneficial conversion feature of 92,552 relating to the convertible promissory notes. 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, the item represented the amortization of beneficial conversion feature of 713,292 relating to the
convertible promissory notes. 

Net income (loss) 

As a result of the foregoing, net income for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 was 7,752,844, representing an increase of 11,460,139 from a net loss of 3,707,295 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Cash Flows and Capital Resources 

We have financed our operations primarily through
shareholder contributions, cash flow from operations, borrowings from third parties and related parties, and equity financing through
private placement and public offerings. 

As reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported cash outflows of 38,390,258 from operating activities. As of September
30, 2024, the Company has working capital of approximately 274.95 million. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the cash used in investing activities was 5,494. 

The Company expects to use the proceeds from the
equity financing as working capital to expand its commodities trading business. 

Based on the foregoing capital market activities,
the management believes that the Company will continue as a going concern in the following 12 months.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

29 

Certain personnel primarily responsible for preparing
our financial statements require additional requisite levels of knowledge, experience and training in the application of U.S. GAAP commensurate
with our financial reporting requirements. The management thought that in light of the inexperience of our accounting staff with respect
to the requirements of U.S. GAAP-based reporting and SEC rules and regulations, we did not maintain effective controls and did not implement
adequate and proper supervisory review to ensure that significant internal control deficiencies can be detected or prevented. 

Management s assessment of the control deficiency
over accounting and finance personnel as of September 30, 2024 includes: 

our lack of sufficient financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriate knowledge of the U.S. GAAP and the SEC reporting requirements to properly address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review consolidated financial statements and related disclosures to fulfill U.S. GAAP and SEC financial reporting requirements. 

our lack of comprehensive accounting policies and procedures manual in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm undertook a comprehensive assessment of our internal control for purposes of identifying and reporting material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. Had we performed a formal assessment of our internal control over financial reporting or had our independent registered public accounting firm performed an audit of our internal control over financial reporting, additional deficiencies may have been identified. 

Following the identification of the material weaknesses
and control deficiencies, we have taken the following remedial measures: engaging an external consulting firm to assist us with the assessment
of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance requirements and improvement of overall internal control. 

We plan to take additional remedial measures,
including (i) hiring more qualified accounting personnel with relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience and qualifications to strengthen
the financial reporting function and to set up a financial and system control framework; and (ii) implementing regular and continuous
U.S. GAAP accounting and financial reporting training programs for our accounting and financial reporting personnel. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure
Controls. Readers are cautioned that our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control
over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error. An internal control system, no matter how well-conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls is also based partly on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any control design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal control over financial reporting.
