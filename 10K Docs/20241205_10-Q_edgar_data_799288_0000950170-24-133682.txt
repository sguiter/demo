for a one-month interest period, (b) for a three-month interest period, or (c) for a six-month interest period 

 Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Lands End, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments which are of a normal and recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented have been reflected. Dollar amounts are reported in thousands, except per share data, unless otherwise noted. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Lands End Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 3, 2024. Macroeconomic Challenges Macroeconomic issues which impact consumer discretionary spending, such as realized inflation-based price increases and high interest rates have continued to have an impact on our business. Apparel purchases historically have been influenced by domestic and global economic conditions, which may negatively impact customer demand and may require higher levels of promotion in order to attract and retain customers. Additionally, the variable interest rates associated with our Debt Facilities are negatively affected by higher interest rate environments. Macroeconomic challenges may lead to increased cost of raw materials, packaging materials, labor, energy, fuel, debt and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products. Moreover, uncertainty with respect to trade policy and tariffs, including increased tariffs applicable to countries where the Company s vendors manufacture our product, may result in an increase in the cost of the Company s products. Restructuring During Fiscal 2023, the Company reduced approximately of its corporate office and Hong Kong sourcing office positions and incurred restructuring charges, primarily severance and benefit and other related costs. The reductions in the Hong Kong sourcing office were organizational changes to move positions to the Company s corporate headquarters to centralize product development to better align with the Company s speed-to-market initiatives. The reductions in the corporate office positions were made to better align with the evolving needs of the business and to invest in key growth areas. For the 39 weeks ended November 1, 2024, the Company incurred restructuring charges, primarily severance and benefit costs, related to cost optimization of business operations and strategic initiatives.

Goodwill impairment assessments In Fiscal 2023, in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the quarter ended October 27, 2023, the Company considered the decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization, as well as the then current market and macroeconomic conditions, to be a triggering event for the U.S. eCommerce and Outfitters reporting units and therefore completed an interim test for impairment of goodwill for these reporting units as of October 27, 2023. The Company tested goodwill for impairment using a one-step quantitative test. The quantitative test compared the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value. An impairment was recorded for any excess carrying value above the reporting unit s fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill. The Company estimated fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow model, commonly referred to as the income approach. The income approach used a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that was discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflected then current market conditions appropriate to the Company s reporting unit. The discounted cash flow model used management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period using the best information available, including growth rates in revenues, costs and estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other significant estimates and assumptions included terminal value growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and changes in future working capital requirements. The testing resulted in goodwill impairment of the remaining million and million of goodwill allocated to the Company s U.S. eCommerce and Outfitters reporting units, respectively, for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 27, 2023. Long-lived Asset Impairment Analysis Property and equipment are subject to a review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ASC 360 the Company reviewed the long-lived asset groups for impairment as of November 1, 2024. During Second Quarter 2024, the Company considered management s decision to replace the existing information technology infrastructure with an enterprise resource planning ERP software system within the next 18 to 24 months to be a triggering event. The Company determined that certain long-lived assets, primarily capitalized internal-use software projects and computer software, would no longer be utilized or have future benefit with the planned ERP platform and recognized impairment in the amount of million and million during the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 1, 2024, respectively, recorded in Other operating expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company Operated store long-lived asset groups, including Operating right-of-use assets, are regularly reviewed for impairment indicators. Impairment is assessed at the individual store level which is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows and considers the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the asset s remaining life. If estimated undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the investment, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value, net of salvage, and any costs of disposition. The fair value estimate is generally the discounted amount of estimated 

 9 

Table of Contents 

impairment was recognized for Operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment, net for any individual identified Company Operated stores as of November 1, 2024 and October 27, 2023, respectively. The Company reviewed the remaining long-lived asset groups for impairment as of November 1, 2024. The Company assessed the recoverability of our long-lived asset groups by comparing their projected undiscounted cash flows associated over remaining estimated useful lives of the primary asset in the long-lived asset group against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives. As a result of the testing, the undiscounted cash flows of the remaining asset groups exceeded their respective carrying amounts resulting in no impairment as of November 1, 2024 .

Effective with the Fourth Amendment to the ABL Facility executed May 12, 2023, the benchmark interest rate was changed from LIBOR to SOFR plus an adjustment of for all loans ABL Adjusted SOFR ). Loan interest rates are selected at the borrower s election, is either (1) ABL Adjusted SOFR, or (2) a base rate which is the greater of (a) the federal funds rate plus , (b) the one-month ABL Adjusted SOFR rate plus , or (c) the Wells Fargo prime rate . The borrowing margin for ABL Adjusted SOFR loans is (i) less than 95.0 million, , (ii) equal to or greater than 95.0 million but less than 180.0 million, , and (iii) greater than or equal to 180.0 million, . For base rate loans, the borrowing margin is (i) less than 95.0 million, , (ii) equal to or greater than 95.0 million but less than 180.0 million, , and (iii) greater than or equal to 180.0 million, Applicable Borrowing Margin ). The Applicable Borrowing Margin for all loans is based upon the average daily total loans outstanding for the previous quarter. The Fourth Amendment had no material interest rate impact. The ABL Facility fees include (i) commitment fees of based upon the average daily unused commitment (aggregate commitment less loans and letter of credit outstanding) under the ABL Facility for the preceding fiscal quarter, (ii) customary letter of credit fees and (iii) customary annual agent fees. As of November 1, 2024, the Company had million borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. 
 Long-Term Debt On December 29, 2023, the Company entered into the Current Term Loan Facility which provides borrowings of million, the proceeds of which were used to repay all of the indebtedness under the Former Term Loan Facility and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the financing. Origination costs, including a original issue discount of million and debt origination fees of million, were incurred in connection with entering into the Current Term Loan Facility. The original issue discount and the debt origination fees are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the Current Term Loan Facility and Former Term Loan Facility and are amortized over the term of the loan to Interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Current Term Loan Facility will mature on , and amortizes at a rate equal to per quarter. Depending upon the Company s Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Current Term Loan Facility, mandatory prepayments in an amount equal to a percentage of the Company s excess cash flows in each fiscal year, ranging from to are required. The Current Term Loan Facility also has typical prepayment requirements for the proceeds of certain asset sales, casualty events and extraordinary receipts. Voluntary prepayment and certain mandatory prepayments made (i) on or before December 29, 2024 would result in a prepayment premium equal to of the principal amount of the loan prepaid plus a yield maintenance fee, (ii) between December 30, 2024 and December 29, 2025 would result in a prepayment premium equal to of the principal amount of the loan prepaid, (iii) between December 30, 2025 and December 29, 2026, would result in a prepayment premium equal to of the principal amount of the loan prepaid, (iv) between December 30, 2026 and December 29, 2027, would result in a prepayment premium equal to of the principal amount of the loan prepaid and (v) thereafter no prepayment premium is due.

The interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Current Term Loan Facility are based on a fluctuating rate of interest equal to, at the Company s election, either (1) Term Loan Adjusted SOFR loan (subject to a floor) plus an applicable margin, or (2) an alternative base rate loan plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company s net leverage and will be, (i) for Term Loan Adjusted SOFR loans, per annum if the total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to :1.00, per annum if the total leverage ratio is less than :1.00 but greater than or equal to :1.00, and per annum if the total leverage ratio is less than :1.00 and (ii) for base rate loans, per annum if the total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to :1.00, per annum if the total leverage ratio is less than :1.00 but greater than or equal to :1.00, and per annum if the total leverage ratio is less than :1.00. In each case, the net leverage is determined as of the last day of each applicable measurement period. Effective with the First Amendment to the Former Term Loan Facility executed June 22, 2023, the interest rate benchmark changed from LIBOR to Term Loan Adjusted SOFR. The annual interest rate applicable to the loans under the Former Term Loan Facility was based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at the borrower s election, either (1) a Term Loan Adjusted SOFR rate plus or (2) an alternative base rate (which is the greater of (i) the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal, (ii) the federal funds rate, which was to be no lower than plus of 1.00 , or (iii) the one month Term Loan Adjusted SOFR rate plus per annum) plus . Both the Current Term Loan Facility and the Former Term Loan Facility contain customary agency fees.

Executive Overview 
 
 Description of the Company 
 
 Lands End is a leading digital retailer of solution-based apparel, swimwear, outerwear, accessories, footwear, home products and uniforms. We offer products online at www.landsend.com , through third-party distribution channels, our own Company Operated stores and third-party license agreements. We also offer products to businesses and schools, for their employees and students, through the Outfitters distribution channel. We are a classic American lifestyle brand that creates solutions for life s every journey. 
 
 Lands End was founded in 1963 by Gary Comer and his partners to sell sailboat hardware and equipment by catalog. While our product focus has shifted significantly over the years, we have continued to adhere to our founder s motto as one of our guiding principles: Take care of the customer, take care of the employee and the rest will take care of itself. 
 
 We have one external reportable segment and identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. Our operating segments consisted of: U.S. eCommerce, Europe eCommerce, Outfitters, Third Party and Retail. 
 
 We have determined that each of our operating segments share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, and therefore, the results of our operating segments are aggregated into one external reportable segment. 
 
 Distribution Channels 
 
 We identify five separate distribution channels for revenue reporting purposes: 
 U.S. eCommerce offers products through our eCommerce website. 

International offers products primarily to consumers located in Europe and through our eCommerce international websites and third-party affiliates. 

Outfitters sells uniform and logo apparel to businesses and their employees, as well as to student households through school relationships, located primarily in the U.S. 

Third Party sells the same products as U.S. eCommerce but direct to consumers through third-party marketplace websites and through domestic wholesale relationships. In addition, Third Party generates revenue from licensing agreements. 

Retail sells products through our Company Operated stores. 

Macroeconomic Challenges 
 
 Macroeconomic issues which impact consumer discretionary spending, such as realized inflation-based price increases and high interest rates, have continued to have an impact on our business. Apparel purchases historically have been influenced by domestic and global economic conditions, which may negatively impact customer demand and may require higher levels of promotion in order to attract and retain customers. Additionally, the variable interest rates associated with our Debt Facilities are negatively affected by higher interest rate environments. Macroeconomic challenges may lead to increased cost of raw materials, packaging materials, labor, energy, fuel, debt and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products. Moreover, uncertainty with respect to trade policy and tariffs, including increased tariffs applicable to countries where our vendors manufacture our product, may result in an increase in the cost of our products.

Table of Contents 

Restructuring 
 
 During Fiscal 2023, we reduced approximately 10 of our corporate office and Hong Kong sourcing office positions and incurred restructuring charges, primarily severance and benefit and other related costs. The reductions in the Hong Kong sourcing office were organizational changes to move positions to our corporate headquarters to centralize product development to better align with our speed-to-market initiatives. The reductions in the corporate office positions were made to better align with the evolving needs of the business and to invest in key growth areas. For the 39 weeks ended November 1, 2024, we incurred restructuring charges, primarily severance and benefit costs, related to cost optimization of business operations and strategic initiatives. 
 
 We incurred 1.8 million and 2.3 million of restructuring costs during the Third Quarter 2024 and Third Quarter 2023, respectively. Restructuring costs of 4.5 million and 2.7 million were incurred Year-to-Date 2024 and Year-to-Date 2023, respectively, and were recorded in Other operating expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 
 As of November 1, 2024, approximately 4.1 million of restructuring costs incurred had yet to be paid and are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 
 The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the accounts of Lands End, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 We experience seasonal fluctuations in our Net revenue and operating results and historically have realized a significant portion of our net revenue and earnings for the year during our fourth fiscal quarter. We generated approximately 34.0 of our net revenue in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022. 
 
 Working capital requirements typically increase during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year as inventory builds to support peak selling periods and, accordingly, working capital requirements typically decrease during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as inventory is sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during that period.

Depreciation and amortization are not included in our cost of sales because we are a reseller of inventory and do not believe that including depreciation and amortization is meaningful. As a result, our gross margins may not be comparable to other entities that include depreciation and amortization related to the sale of their product in their gross margin measure. 
 
 Definitions, Reconciliations and Uses of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to our Net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP, for purposes of evaluating operating performance, we report the following non-GAAP measures: Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted net income (loss) is also expressed on a diluted per share basis. 
 
 We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors, allowing them to assess how the business performed excluding the effects of significant non-recurring or non-operational amounts. We believe the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparing the results being reported against past and future results by eliminating amounts that we believe are not comparable between periods and assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management s own methods for evaluating business performance. 
 
 Our management uses Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the operating performance of our business for comparable periods and to discuss our business with our Board of Directors, institutional investors and other market participants. Adjusted EBITDA is also used as the basis for a performance measure used in executive incentive compensation. 
 
 The methods we use to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods other companies use to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA should not be used by investors or other third parties as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions as these measures may exclude a number of important cash and non-cash recurring items. 
 
 Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) excluding significant non-recurring or non-operational items as set forth below. Adjusted net income (loss) is also presented on a diluted per share basis. While Adjusted net income (loss) is a non-GAAP measurement, management believes that it is an important indicator of operating performance and useful to investors. 
 
 Other significant non-recurring or non-operational items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects comparability of results and are described below: 

Goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges associated with the non-cash write down of goodwill and certain long-lived assets for the 13 and 39 weeks ended November 1, 2024 and October 27, 2023. 

Exit costs charges associated to exit the kids and footwear lines of business including excess and obsolescence reserves, inventory discounts and operational charges recorded in the 39 weeks ended November 1, 2024 in conjunction with our licensing arrangements which commenced in Fiscal 2024.

While Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement, management believes that it is an important indicator of operating performance, and is useful to investors, because EBITDA excludes the effects of financings, investing activities and tax structure by eliminating the effects of interest, depreciation and income tax. 
 
 Other significant items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects comparability of results and are described below:

In assessing the operational performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial measures. We operate in five separate distribution channels for revenue reporting purposes: U.S. eCommerce, International, Outfitters, Third Party and Retail. A key measure in the evaluation of our business is revenue performance by distribution channel. We also consider gross margin and Selling and administrative expenses in evaluating the performance of our business. 
 
 We use Net revenue to evaluate revenue performance for the U.S. eCommerce, International, Outfitters and Third Party distribution channels. We use GMV, which equals total order value of all Lands End branded merchandise sold to customers through business-to-consumer and business-to-business channels, as well as the retail value of the merchandise sold through third party distribution channels, as an important indicator of the performance of the comparable growth of the total brand. For our Retail distribution channel, we use Same Store Sales as a key measure in evaluating performance. A Company Operated store is included in U.S. Same Store Sales calculations when it has been open for at least 14 months. Online sales and sales generated through our in-store web portal are considered revenue in our U.S. eCommerce and are excluded from U.S. Same Store Sales.

 U.S. eCommerce Net revenue was 186.1 million for Third Quarter 2024, a decrease of 4.1 million or 2.2 , from 190.2 million during Third Quarter 2023. The decrease in U.S. eCommerce was primarily driven by the transition of kids and footwear products from a direct to a license model, lower promotional activity and improved inventory management resulting in increased gross profit from higher gross margins. Excluding the impact of transitioning kids and footwear products to licensing arrangements, U.S. eCommerce Net revenue increased by 11.9 . 
 
 International eCommerce Net revenue was 25.0 million for Third Quarter 2024, a decrease of 1.2 million or 4.6 , from 26.2 million during Third Quarter 2023.

 Outfitters Net revenue was 73.4 million for Third Quarter 2024, a decrease of 0.9 million or 1.2 , from 74.3 million during Third Quarter 2023. The business uniform channel increased year-over-year primarily due to the strength in national accounts. The school uniform channel decreased primarily due to the timing of customer orders earlier in the back-to-school season as compared to the prior year. 
 
 Third Party Net revenue was 25.5 million for Third Quarter 2024, an increase of 1.5 million or 6.3 , from 24.0 million during Third Quarter 2023. The increase was primarily due to revenue generated from licensing arrangements.

Gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points to 50.6 in Third Quarter 2024, compared with 47.0 in Third Quarter 2023. The gross margin improvement was primarily driven by lower promotional activity, leveraging the strength in product solutions and newness across the channels and improved supply chain costs.

 Selling and administrative expenses increased 5.6 million to 140.9 million or 44.2 of total Net revenue in Third Quarter 2024 compared with 135.3 million or 41.7 of Net revenue in Third Quarter 2023. The approximately 250 basis points increase was primarily driven by higher digital marketing spend focused on new customer acquisition. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 1.4 million to 8.2 million in Third Quarter 2024 compared with 9.6 million in Third Quarter 2023.

 Other Operating Expense 
 
 Other operating expense, net was 2.8 million in Third Quarter 2024 compared to 2.3 million in Third Quarter 2023. The increase was attributed to a 1.0 million non-cash charge related to long-lived asset impairment offset by 0.5 million lower restructuring costs in Third Quarter 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our business, which are inventory purchases, payments on debt, capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. Our cash and cash equivalents and the ABL Facility serve as sources of liquidity for short-term working capital needs and general corporate purposes. The ABL Facility had a balance outstanding of 60.0 million on November 1, 2024, other than letters of credit. Cash generated from our net revenue and profitability, and to a lesser extent our changes in working capital, are driven by the seasonality of our business, with a significant amount of net revenue and operating cash flows generally occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. We expect that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations, along with revolving on the ABL Facility, will be adequate to meet our capital requirements and operational needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 
 ABL Facility 
 
 Our 275.0 million committed revolving ABL Facility includes a 70.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and is available for working capital and other general corporate liquidity needs and matures on July 29, 2026. The amount available to borrow is the lesser of (1) the Aggregate Commitments of 275.0 million ABL Facility Limit or (2) the Borrowing Base or Loan Cap which is calculated from Eligible Inventory, Trade Receivables and Credit Card Receivables, all foregoing capitalized terms not defined herein are as defined in the ABL Facility. The balance outstanding on November 1, 2024 and October 27, 2023 was 60.0 million and 110.0 million, respectively. The balance of outstanding letters of credit was 11.1 million and 8.9 million on November 1, 2024 and October 27, 2023, respectively. The borrowing availability under the ABL Facility was 90.3 million and 156.1 million as of November 1, 2024 and October 27, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Effective with the Fourth Amendment to the ABL Facility executed May 12, 2023, the benchmark interest rate was changed from LIBOR to SOFR plus an adjustment of 0.10 for all loans ABL Adjusted SOFR ). Loan interest rates are selected at the borrower s election, is either (1) ABL Adjusted SOFR, or (2) a base rate which is the greater of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , (b) the one-month ABL Adjusted SOFR rate plus 1.00 , or (c) the Wells Fargo prime rate . The borrowing margin for ABL Adjusted SOFR loans is (i) less than 95.0 million, 1.25 , (ii) equal to or greater than 95.0 million but less than 180.0 million, 1.50 , and (iii) greater than or equal to 180.0 million, 1.75 . For base rate loans, the borrowing margin is (i) less than 95.0 million, 0.50 , (ii) equal to or greater than 95.0 million but less than 180.0 million, 0.75 , and (iii) greater than or equal to 180.0 million, 1.00 Applicable Borrowing Margin ). The Applicable Borrowing Margin for all loans is based upon the average daily total loans outstanding for the previous quarter. The Fourth Amendment had no material interest rate impact. 
 
 The ABL Facility fees include (i) commitment fees of 0.25 based upon the average daily unused commitment (aggregate commitment less loans and letter of credit outstanding) under the ABL Facility for the preceding fiscal quarter, (ii) customary letter of credit fees and (iii) customary annual agent fees. As of November 1, 2024, we had 60.0 million borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. 
 
 Long-Term Debt 
 
 On December 29, 2023, we entered into the Current Term Loan Facility which provides borrowings of 260.0 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay all of the indebtedness under the Former Term Loan Facility and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the financing. Origination costs, including a 3 original issue discount of 7.8 million and debt origination fees of 3.8 million, were incurred in connection with entering into the Current Term Loan Facility. 
 
 The Current Term Loan Facility will mature on December 29, 2028, and amortizes at a rate equal to 1.25 per quarter. Depending upon the Company s Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Current Term Loan Facility, mandatory prepayments in an amount equal to a percentage of the Company s excess cash flows in each fiscal year, ranging from 0 to 75 are required. The Current Term Loan Facility also has typical prepayment requirements for the proceeds of certain asset sales, casualty events and extraordinary receipts. Voluntary prepayment and certain mandatory prepayments made (i) on or before December 29, 2024 would result in a prepayment premium equal to 3 of the principal amount of the loan prepaid plus a yield maintenance fee, (ii) between December 30, 2024 and December 29, 2025 would result in a prepayment premium equal to 2 of the principal amount of the loan prepaid, (iii) between December 30, 2025 and December 29, 2026, would result in a prepayment premium equal to 1 of the principal amount of the 
 31 

Table of Contents 

loan prepaid, (iv) between December 30, 2026 and December 29, 2027, would result in a prepayment premium equal to 0.5 of the principal amount of the loan prepaid and (v) thereafter no prepayment premium is due. 
 
 The interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Current Term Loan Facility are based on a fluctuating rate of interest equal to, at the Company s election, either (1) Term Loan Adjusted SOFR loan (subject to a 2 floor) plus an applicable margin, or (2) an alternative base rate loan plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company s net leverage and will be, (i) for Term Loan Adjusted SOFR loans, 8.25 per annum if the total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.75:1.00, 8.00 per annum if the total leverage ratio is less than 2.75:1.00 but greater than or equal to 2.25:1.00, and 7.75 per annum if the total leverage ratio is less than 2.25:1.00 and (ii) for base rate loans, 7.25 per annum if the total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.75:1.00, 7.00 per annum if the total leverage ratio is less than 2.75:1.00 but greater than or equal to 2.25:1.00, and 6.75 per annum if the total leverage ratio is less than 2.25:1.00. In each case, the net leverage is determined as of the last day of each applicable measurement period. 
 
 Effective with the First Amendment to the Former Term Loan Facility executed June 22, 2023, the interest rate benchmark changed from LIBOR to Term Loan Adjusted SOFR. The annual interest rate applicable to the loans under the Former Term Loan Facility was based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at the borrower s election, either (1) a Term Loan Adjusted SOFR rate plus 9.75 or (2) an alternative base rate (which is the greater of (i) the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal, (ii) the federal funds rate, which was to be no lower than 0.00 plus of 1.00 , or (iii) the one month Term Loan Adjusted SOFR rate plus 1.00 per annum) plus 8.75 .

 Net cash used in operating activities was 12.2 million during Year-to-Date 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 36.7 million during Year-to-Date 2023. The increase in net cash used was due to changes in working capital, primarily the reduction of cash used for inventories during Year-to-Date 2023. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 22.1 million and 28.5 million during Year-to-Date 2024 and Year-to-Date 2023, respectively. Cash used in investing activities for both periods was primarily used for investments to update our digital information technology infrastructure. The decrease in Year-to-Date 2024 was primarily a result of the timing of capitalized expenditures in the second half of Fiscal 2023 and first half of Fiscal 2024. 
 
 For Fiscal 2024, we plan to invest approximately 35.0 million in capital expenditures for strategic investments and infrastructure, primarily in technology and general corporate needs. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 39.4 million during Year-to-Date 2024, compared with net cash used in financing activities of 11.4 million during Year-to-Date 2023. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to borrowings on the ABL Facility. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
 
 There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and off-balance-sheet arrangements as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024. 
 
 Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk 
 
 The ABL Facility is available for working capital and other general corporate liquidity needs. The balance outstanding on November 1, 2024 and October 27, 2023 was 60.0 million and 110.0 million, respectively. The balance of outstanding letters of credit was 11.1 million and 8.9 million on November 1, 2024 and October 27, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue, inventory valuation, goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. 
 
 For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 2, 2024. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies or their application since February 2, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 
 The Company s international subsidiaries operate with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Since the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the Company must translate all components of these financial statements from the functional currencies into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of the reporting period. Net revenue generated from the International distribution channel represented approximately 8.0 of our total Net revenue during the Year-to-Date 2024. The fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affects the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. Assuming a 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates, our Net revenue for Year-to-Date 2024 would have increased or decreased by approximately 7.3 million. Translation gains or losses, which are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss, result from translation of the assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Foreign currency translation income, net, for Year-to-Date 2024 totaled approximately 0.3 million related to our international subsidiaries in United Kingdom and Germany. Additionally, the Company has foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables that when settled result in a transaction gain or loss. A 10 change in foreign currency exchanges rates would not result in a significant transaction gain or loss in earnings. The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes or hedging and has not used any derivative financial instruments to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposures. The Company does not consider our foreign earnings to be permanently reinvested. 
 
 As of November 1, 2024, the Company had 10.0 million of cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currency, principally in British pound sterling, euro and Hong Kong dollar. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Company is subject to interest rate risk with the Current Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility, as both require the Company to pay interest on outstanding borrowings at variable rates. Each one percentage point change in interest rates (above the 2.00 SOFR floor) associated with the Current Term Loan Facility would result in a 2.5 million change in our annual cash interest expenses. Assuming our ABL Facility was fully drawn to a principal amount equal to 275.0 million, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in a 2.8 million change in our annual cash interest expense.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on their evaluation for the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of November 1, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 under the Exchange Act during the most recently completed fiscal quarter ended November 1, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The Company is party to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these actions involve complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. At this time, the Company is not able to either predict the outcome of these legal proceedings or reasonably estimate a potential range of loss with respect to the proceedings. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of pending claims, proceedings and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position taken as a whole. 
 
 As disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 2, 2024, Lands End is the defendant in three separate lawsuits, each of which allege adverse health events and personal property damage as a result of wearing uniforms manufactured by Lands End: (1) Gilbert et al. v. Lands End, Inc ., United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, Civil Action No. 3:19-cv-00823-JDP, complaint filed October 3, 2019; (2) Andrews et al. v. Lands End, Inc. , United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, Civil Action No. 3:19-cv-01066-JDP, complaint filed on December 31, 2019, on behalf of 521 named plaintiffs, later amended to include 1,089 named plaintiffs; and (3) Davis et al. v. Lands End, Inc. and Lands End Business Outfitters, Inc. , United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, Case No. 3:20-cv-00195, complaint filed on March 4, 2020. Plaintiffs in Gilbert, Andrews, and Davis seek nationwide class certification on behalf of similarly situated Delta employees. 
 
 By order dated April 20, 2020, the Court consolidated the Gilbert and Andrews cases (the Consolidated Wisconsin Action and stayed the Davis case. Plaintiffs in the Consolidated Wisconsin Action and Davis each assert that the damages sustained by the members of the proposed class exceed 5,000,000. Plaintiffs in each case seek damages for personal injuries, pain and suffering, severe emotional distress, financial or economic loss, including medical services and expenses, lost income and other compensable injuries. Plaintiffs in the Consolidated Wisconsin Action seek class certification with respect to performance of the uniforms and warranty claims and maintain individual claims for personal injury by numerous named plaintiffs. 
 
 On August 18, 2021, the Court ruled on several pending motions in the Consolidated Wisconsin Action. The Court denied Plaintiffs motion for class certification with respect to performance of the uniforms and warranty claims. The Court denied Plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment regarding crocking claims and granted Lands End s motion for partial summary judgment related to certain warranty claims. In addition, giving effect to both the addition and voluntary dismissal of individual plaintiffs over the course of the litigation, the number of individual plaintiffs had been reduced from 1,089 to 603 as of August 18, 2021. On September 1, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Rule 23(f) petition, seeking interlocutory review of the Court s decision denying class certification. On September 22, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit denied plaintiffs petition. 
 
 On July 8, 2022, the Court issued an Opinion and Order in the Consolidated Wisconsin Action (the July 8 Opinion ), ruling in the Company s favor on several additional pending motions. The Court granted the Company s motion to exclude Plaintiffs expert opinions because the opinions were not based on reliably applied and scientifically valid methods. Accordingly, because Plaintiffs failed to submit evidence sufficient to show that the uniforms were defective or that a defect in the uniforms caused Plaintiffs alleged health problems, the Court granted the Company s motion for summary judgement on Plaintiffs personal injury claims. 
 
 After giving effect to the July 8 Opinion, the remaining claims under the Consolidated Wisconsin Action related to claims for property damage and breach of warranty. Following these rulings and an order of the court dated December 1, 2022, 277 named Plaintiffs remained in the case who claim they have suffered personal property damage as a result of dye transferring to personal items, with aggregate claims of approximately 110,000 in damages. The Court set a deadline for the parties to voluntarily resolve these remaining outstanding claims, and on July 19, 2023 the parties reported to the Court that they had reached a settlement in principle of the matter, and subsequently entered into a Confidential Settlement, fully resolving the outstanding property damage claims, which were the only remaining claims in the action. 
 
 Following the entry of the Final Order by the Court on October 12, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Seventh Circuit. On November 13, 2023, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued an Order suspending the briefing schedule pending a remand to the district court for the limited purpose of issuing a revised final judgement order. On February 15, 2024, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh District remanded the case to the District Court for entry of a final judgement. On February 20, 2024, the District Court entered final judgement in favor of Lands End. On March 18, 2024, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued a briefing schedule. All briefs have been filed and oral argument occurred on November 14, 2024. The parties await the decision of the appellate court. Lands End continues its vigorous defense of this case and believes the claims are without merit.
