PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about beliefs, expectations, targets and goals are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on plans, estimates, expectations and/or goals at the time the statements are made, and readers should not place undue reliance on them. In some cases, readers can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terms such as may, will, should, expect, opportunity, intend, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, target, goal, or continue, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terms. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and readers are cautioned that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described herein include, among others: 
 
 risks associated with potential significant volatility and fluctuations in the market price of the Company s common stock; 
 
 risks associated with raising additional equity or debt capital from public or private markets to pursue the Company s business plan, including potentially one or more additional private placements of common stock, and the effects that raising such capital may have on the Company and its business, including the risk of substantial dilution or that the Company s common stock may experience a substantial decline in trading price; 
 
 the possibility that additional future financings may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all; 
 
 the possibility that an active, liquid trading market for the Company s common stock may not be sustained; 
 
 the possibility that the Company s outstanding warrants and preferred stock may or may not be converted or exercised, and the economic impact on the Company and the holders of common stock of the Company that may result from either such exercise or conversion, including dilution, or the continuance of the preferred stock remaining outstanding, and the impact its terms, including its dividend, may have on the Company and the common stock of the Company; 
 
 uncertainties regarding the Company s focus, strategic plans and other management actions; 
 
 the risk that the Company is or becomes highly dependent on the continued leadership of Brad Jacobs as chairman and chief executive officer and the possibility that the loss of Mr. Jacobs in these roles could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations; 
 
 the possibility that the concentration of ownership by Mr. Jacobs may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company and might affect the market price of shares of the common stock of the Company; 
 
 the risk that Mr. Jacobs past performance may not be representative of future results; 
 
 the risk that the Company is unable to attract and retain world-class talent; 
 
 the risk that the failure to consummate any acquisition expeditiously, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business prospects, financial condition, results of operations or the price of the Company s common stock; 
 
 risks that the Company may not be able to enter into agreements with acquisition targets on attractive terms, or at all, that agreed acquisitions may not be consummated, or, if consummated, that the anticipated benefits thereof may not be realized and that the Company encounter difficulties in integrating and operating such acquired companies, or that matters related to an acquired business (including operating results or liabilities or contingencies) may have a negative effect on the Company or its securities or ability to implement its business strategy, including that any such transaction may be dilutive or have other negative consequences to the Company and its value or the trading prices of its securities; 
 
 risks associated with cybersecurity and technology, including attempts by third parties to defeat the security measures of the Company and its business partners, and the loss of confidential information and other business disruptions; 
 
 the possibility that new investors in any future financing transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the Company s existing stockholders; 
 
 the possibility that building products distribution industry demand may soften or shift substantially due to cyclicality or seasonality or dependence on general economic and political conditions, including inflation or deflation, interest rates, governmental subsidies or incentives, consumer confidence, labor and supply shortages, weather and commodity prices; 
 
 the possibility that regional or global barriers to trade or a global trade war could increase the cost of products in the building products distribution industry, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of such products and the financial results of businesses in the industry; 
 
 risks associated with periodic litigation, regulatory proceedings and enforcement actions, which may adversely affect the Company s business and financial performance; 
 3 

uncertainties regarding general economic, business, competitive, legal, regulatory, tax and geopolitical conditions; and 
 
 other factors, including those set forth in the Company s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
 The company cautions that forward-looking statements should not be relied on as predictions of future events, and these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. Forward-looking statements herein speak only as of the date each statement is made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements in light of new information or future events, except to the extent required by applicable law.

 Following the closing of the Equity Investment, the Board of Directors of the Company was reconstituted such that: i) the number of seats on the Board was designated by JPE, ii) each of the directors (including Mr. Jacobs) was designated by JPE, iii) each standing committee of the Board was reconstituted in a manner designated by JPE, and iv) Mr. Jacobs was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. 
 Issuance of Convertible Preferred Stock 
 
 On June 6, 2024, under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company issued shares of Convertible Preferred Stock. The Convertible Preferred Stock has an initial liquidation preference of thousand per share, for an aggregate initial liquidation preference of billion. The Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at any time, in whole or in part and from time to time, at the option of the holder thereof into a number of shares of common stock equal to the then-applicable liquidation preference divided by the conversion price, which initially is per share of common stock (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). Shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are initially convertible into an aggregate of shares of common stock (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split). The Convertible Preferred Stock is not redeemable or subject to any required offer to purchase. 
 
 The Convertible Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and distribution of assets upon liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, senior to the Company s common stock. Holders of Convertible Preferred Stock will vote together with the holders of the Company s common stock on an as-converted basis on all matters, except as otherwise required by law. In addition, the approval of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, will be required for certain matters set forth in the Certificate of Designation for the Convertible Preferred Stock. 
 
 Dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock are payable quarterly, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company at the rate per annum of per share on the then-applicable liquidation preference (subject to certain exceptions in the event that the Company pays dividends on shares of its common stock). During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid million of quarterly dividends to holders of Convertible Preferred Stock. Subsequent to the close of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid million of quarterly dividends to holders of Convertible Preferred Stock.

The Warrants have an exercise price of per share of common stock with respect to of the Warrants, per share of common stock with respect to of the Warrants, and per share of common stock with respect to the remaining of the Warrants. 
 
 Each Warrant may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time or times on or after the issuance date and on or before the expiration date at the election of the holder (in such holder s sole discretion) by means of a cashless exercise in which the holder will be entitled to receive a number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to the quotient of the product of the Closing Sale Price (as defined in the Warrant Certificate) of a share of the Company s common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the holder elects to exercise its Warrant, less the adjusted exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares of the Company s common stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrant, divided by the aforementioned Closing Sale Price of a share of the Company s common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the holder elects to exercise its Warrant.

We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements would be affected to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 
 Overview 
 QXO, Inc. QXO , we , or the Company was formerly known as SilverSun Technologies, Inc. SilverSun ). On June 6, 2024, we changed the Company s name from SilverSun to QXO and changed its ticker symbol on the Nasdaq Capital Market from SSNT to QXO, upon completing a 1.0 billion cash investment in SilverSun by Jacobs Private Equity II, LLC JPE and certain minority co-investors. Refer to Note 3 - Equity of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about the investment and related changes to our capital structure. 
 
 QXO is a technology solutions and professional services company that helps businesses manage and monetize their enterprise assets. We do this through our legacy operations, which provide critical software applications, consulting and other professional services, including specialized programming, training and technical support. Our customers are primarily small and mid-sized companies in the manufacturing, distribution and service industries. 
 
 Our strategy is to create a tech-forward leader in the 800 billion building products distribution industry with the goal of generating outsized stockholder value through accretive acquisitions and organic growth, including greenfield openings. We are executing our strategy toward a target of tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue in the next decade. 
 
 We grow our legacy business with a multi-pronged plan that fosters recurring revenue, customer retention and the steady expansion of our installed customer base, accomplished via sales and acquisitions. As we gain new customers, we help them digitally transform their business with further technologies and third-party software we represent, including application hosting, cybersecurity, warehouse management, human capital management, payment automation, sales tax compliance and many other value-added capabilities. Many of our offerings are billed on a subscription basis, increasing our monthly recurring revenue from new business in tandem with cross-selling. Our model is designed to increase average revenue per customer over the course of the relationship, facilitating our growth without a commensurate increase in costs of sales, and enhancing our profitability profile.

Our legacy business has five core components : 
 Enterprise Resource Planning Software 
 Substantially all our initial sales of ERP financial accounting solutions consist of pre-packaged software and associated services to customers in the United States. We resell Sage, Accumatica, and other ERP software products, and provide related services, including installation, implementation, support, training, and a technical help desk. 
 Value-Added Services for ERP 
 Our consulting and professional services organization shepherds our customer relationships from installation to go-live and forward as needed. A significant portion of our service revenue comes from continuing to work with existing customers as their needs change, with flexible revenue options that include prepaid services, time and materials as utilized and annual support. 
 IT Managed Network Services and Business Consulting 
 We provide comprehensive managed Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions, such as infrastructure-as-a-service, cybersecurity, cloud hosting, business continuity, disaster recovery, data back-up, network maintenance and server applications upgrade services. 
 Cybersecurity 
 Our cybersecurity-as-a-service offering is managed by our security operations center and includes incident response, cybersecurity assessments and hacking simulations. This SaaS offering is particularly valuable to customers in compliance-driven and regulated industries, including financial services, pension administration, insurance and the land and title sector. 
 Application Hosting 
 Our SaaS hosting solutions enable applications to reside securely in a remote cloud infrastructure and be accessed by our customers through the internet, eliminating many of the costs of maintaining business technologies on site. 
 Our Company has executed this plan successfully to expand into new geographies and create additional revenue and profit streams. This has strengthened our legacy operating platform and expanded our footprint to nearly every U.S. state, with concentrations in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon and Washington as of September 30, 2024 .

 Revenue, net 
 Our consolidated net revenue for the third quarter of 2024 remained relatively consistent, slightly decreasing 268,000 or 2.0 , compared with the same period in the prior year. Our consolidated net revenue for the nine months of 2024 increased 2.3 million or 5.8 compared with the same period in the prior year. Net revenue for the nine months increased across our lines of business as we grew our customer base through strategic acquisitions and continued renewals of our subscription-based services. Specifically, software product revenue increased as we expanded our Sage Intacct and Acumatica product lines, and service revenue increased as we expanded our hosting application services and consulting practices. 
 
 Cost of revenue 
 Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 360,000 or 4.5 , compared with the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, margin expanded to 41.4 , compared with 39.9 for the same period in the prior year. Margin expansion in the period is attributed to improved operational productivity in serving customer demand. For the nine months of 2024, cost of revenue increased 1.3 million or 5.5 associated with the increase in revenue, compared with the same period in the prior year. Margin increased to 40.1 , compared with 39.9 for the same period in the prior year, as we expanded our product offerings in newly acquired lines of business to grow our customer base. 
 Operating expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased 31.3 million or 406.0 , compared with the same period in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months of 2024 increased 37.0 million or 217.6 , compared with the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year increases in operating expenses are primarily due to: i) salary and expense and share-based compensation associated with the Company s new senior management team put in place to execute our expansive growth plan, ii) the severance payment contemplated in the Investment Agreement for Mark Meller and, iii) certain transaction costs associated with the private placements. 

21 

Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 49,000 or 25.0 , compared with the same period in the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first nine months of 2024 increased 138,000 or 22.7 , compared with the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year increases are attributed to higher amortization expense associated with the acquisition of JCS in 2023. 
 Interest income (expense), net 
 
 Interest income increased 57.0 million and 60.5 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in the prior year. The increase is attributed to the interest earned on our cash position due to the cash infusion from the Equity Investment and the private placements that closed in July 2024. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed here and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization; share-based compensation; income tax (benefit) provision; interest (income) expense; transaction costs; severance costs and other items that we do not consider representative of our underlying operations. We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in making financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluating QXO s ongoing performance. 
 
 We believe that Adjusted EBITDA facilitates analysis of our ongoing business operations because it excludes items that may not be reflective of, or are unrelated to, QXO s core operating performance, and may assist investors with comparisons to prior periods and assessing trends in our underlying business. Other companies may calculate this non-GAAP financial measure differently, and therefore our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. This non-GAAP financial measure should only be used as a supplemental measure of our operating performance. 
 
 Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, net income (loss), and our other GAAP results. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA. 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (in thousands)

 The year-over-year declines in three- and nine-month 2024 Adjusted EBITDA were due to higher employee-related costs in the third quarter, reflecting the introduction of a new senior management team to execute the Company s expansive growth plan. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 On June 6, 2024, we closed the Equity Investment under the Investment Agreement that we entered into on April 14, 2024 among the Company, JPE and certain minority investors. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value 0.001 per share (the "Convertible Preferred Stock"), which are initially convertible into an aggregate of 219,010,074 shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of 4.566 per share, and we issued and sold warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 219,010,074 shares of common stock (the "Warrants"). Upon closing, the Equity Investment generated gross proceeds of 1.0 billion, before deducting agent fees and offering expenses. For more information on the Investment Agreement, refer to Note 3 - Equity. 
 
 22 

On June 13, 2024, we entered into purchase agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors to issue and sell in a private placement an aggregate of 340,932,212 shares of our common stock at a price of 9.14 per share, and Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 42,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 9.13999 per Pre-Funded Warrant. Each Pre-Funded Warrant has an exercise price of 0.00001 per share, is exercisable immediately and until the Pre-Funded Warrant is exercised in full. The closing of the issuance and sale of these securities was consummated on July 19, 2024, and generated gross proceeds of approximately 3.5 billion before deducting agent fees and offering expenses. 
 
 On July 22, 2024, we entered into additional purchase agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors to issue and sell in a private placement an aggregate of 67,833,699 shares of our common stock at a price of 9.14 per share. The closing of the issuance and sale of these securities was consummated on July 25, 2024, and generated gross proceeds of approximately 620 million, before deducting agent fees and offering expenses. 
 Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, we declared a 17.4 million aggregate cash dividend to its stockholders of record as of the day before the closing of the Equity Investment. The dividend was paid from proceeds received from the Equity Investment. Under the terms of the Convertible Preferred Stock, dividends are paid quarterly when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors (the Board ), at the rate per annum of 9 per share. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we paid 9.8 million of quarterly dividends to holders of Convertible Preferred Stock. Subsequent to the close of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we paid 22.5 million of quarterly dividends to holders of Convertible Preferred Stock. 
 
 The Company s cash balance was 5.04 billion as of September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds. We continually evaluate our liquidity requirements in light of our operating needs, growth initiatives and capital resources. We believe that our existing liquidity and sources of capital are sufficient to support our operations over the next 12 months. 
 Cash provided by operating activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased by 30.1 million, compared with the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year increase is attributed to interest income earned in the period offset by higher personnel costs associated with the execution of the Company's strategy as contemplated in the Investment Agreement. 
 Cash used in investing activities 
 Cash used in investing activities decreased by 11,000, compared with the same period in the prior year. Investment in capital expenditures is mainly associated with IT equipment to support the business. 
 Cash provided by used in) financing activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 5.0 billion, compared with 1.9 million of cash used in financing activities in the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year increase is attributed to the Equity Investment of June 6, 2024 and the private placements in July 2024. The Company paid the common stock dividend, the preferred stock dividend, and paid its long-term debt obligations with proceeds from these investments. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 23 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

Employee shall also provide the Company with fourteen (14) days advance notice prior to becoming employed by any person or entity or engaging in any business of any type or form, regardless of whether or not the prospective employer or business is engaged in a Competing Business. 
 17. Prohibited Use of Confidential Information of Employee s Prior Employers .

Employee agrees that if, subsequent to the Termination Date, the Company determines that the Company could have terminated Employee s employment for Cause, or the Company discovers a breach of any provision herein, Employee s employment shall, at the
