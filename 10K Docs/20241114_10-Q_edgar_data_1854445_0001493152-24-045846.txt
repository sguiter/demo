million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. While the
Company s cash flow has improved in recent months, its cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 may not be
sufficient to fund operations and other commitments for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these condensed
consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

Outside
of potential revenue growth generated by the Company, in order to restore the going concern the Company may take actions which could
include but are not limited to: further cost reductions, equity or debt financings and restructuring of potential future cash contingent
acquisition liabilities. There is no assurance that these actions will be taken or be successful if pursued. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described. 

Potential
liquidity resources 

Potential
liquidity resources may include the further sale of common stock pursuant to the unused portion of the million S-3 registration
statement filed with the SEC on October 28, 2022. Such financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all.

The
Company s contingent consideration is categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Contingent consideration is
recorded within contingent consideration, current, and contingent consideration, non-current, in the Company s condensed
consolidated balance sheets as of September 30 and June 30, 2024. Contingent consideration has been recorded at its fair values
using unobservable inputs and have included, at the time of acquisition, using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing framework, incorporating contractual
terms and assumptions regarding financial forecasts, discount rates, and volatility of forecasted revenue. The development and
determination of the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility of
the Company s management with, at times, the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. 

The
Company s other financial instruments consist primarily of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other liabilities, and approximate
fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

GLIMPSE GROUP, INC. 

 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Significant
Judgments 

The
Company s contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products/services. Determining whether products/services
are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.
Further, judgment may be required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. 

Disaggregation
of Revenue 

The
Company generated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 by delivering: (i) Software Services, consisting primarily
of VR/AR/Spatial Computing software projects, solutions and consulting services, and (ii) Software Licenses SaaS, consisting primarily
of VR, AR and Spatial Computing software licenses or SaaS. The Company currently generates its revenues primarily from customers in the
United States. 

Revenue
for a significant portion of Software Services projects and solutions (projects whereby, the development of the project leads to an identifiable
asset with an alternative use to the Company) is recognized at the point of time in which the customer obtains control of the project,
customer accepts delivery and confirms completion of the project. Certain
other Software Services revenues are custom project solutions (projects whereby, the development
of the custom project leads to an identifiable asset with no alternative use to the Company, and, in which, the Company also has an enforceable
right to payment under the contract) and are therefore recognized based on the percentage of completion using an input model with a master
budget. The budget is reviewed periodically and percentage of completion adjusted accordingly. 

Revenue
for Software Services consulting services and website maintenance is recognized when the Company performs the services, typically on
a monthly retainer basis. 

Revenue
for Software Licenses is recognized at the point of time in which the Company delivers the software and customer accepts delivery. Software
Licenses often include third party components that are a fully integrated part of the Software License stack and are therefore considered
as one deliverable and performance obligation. If there are significant contractually stated ongoing service obligations to be performed
during the term of the Software License or SaaS contract, then revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. 

Timing
of Revenue 

Products and services transferred/recognized over time 

Total Revenue 

Remaining
Performance Obligations 

Timing
of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company generally records a receivable/contract asset
when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or deferred revenue/contract liability when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. 

For
certain Software Services project contracts the Company invoices customers after the project has been delivered and accepted by the customer.
Software Service project contracts typically consist of designing and programming software for the customer. In most cases, there is
only one distinct performance obligation, and revenue is recognized upon completion, delivery and customer acceptance. Contracts may
include multiple distinct projects that can each be implemented and operated independently of subsequent projects in the contract. In
such cases, the Company accounts for these projects as separate distinct performance obligations and recognizes revenue upon the completion
of each project or obligation, its delivery and customer acceptance. 

THE
GLIMPSE GROUP, INC. 

 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

For
contracts recognized over time, contract liabilities include billings invoiced for software projects for which the contract s performance
obligations are not complete. 

For
certain other Software Services project contracts, the Company invoices customers for a substantial portion of the project upon entering
into the contract due to their custom nature and revenue is recognized based upon percentage of completion. Revenue recognized subsequent
to invoicing is recorded as a deferred revenue/contract liability (billings in excess of cost) and revenue recognized prior to invoicing
is recorded as a deferred cost/contract asset (cost in excess of billings). 

For
Software Services consulting or retainer contracts, the Company generally invoices customers monthly at the beginning of each month in
advance for services to be performed in the following month. The sole performance obligation is satisfied when the services are performed.
Software Services consulting or retainer contracts typically consist of ongoing support for a customer s software or specified
business practices. 

For
Software License contracts, the Company generally invoices customers when the software has been delivered to and accepted by the customer,
which is also when the performance obligation is satisfied. For SaaS contracts, the Company generally invoices customers in advance at
the beginning of the service term. 

For
multi-period Software License contracts, the Company generally invoices customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period.
Software License contracts consist of providing clients with software designed by the Company. For Software License contracts, there
are generally no ongoing support obligations unless specified in the contract (becoming a Software Service). 

Unfulfilled
performance obligations represent amounts expected to be earned by the Company on executed contracts. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023,
the Company had approximately million and million, respectively, in unfulfilled performance obligations.

Contingent
Consideration 

As
of September 30, and June 30, 2024, the Company s contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions are categorized
as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Contingent consideration was valued at September 30, and June 30, 2024 using unobservable
inputs, primarily internal revenue forecasts. Contingent consideration was valued at the time of acquisitions using unobservable inputs
and have included using the Monte Carlo simulation model. This model incorporated revenue volatility, internal rate of return, and a
risk-free rate. The development and determination of the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations
are the responsibility of the Company s management with the assistance, at times, of a third-party valuation specialist.

Revenue
projections for Brightline Interactive, LLC BLI are expected to trigger potential additional gross consideration of
 
million over the remainder of the contingent consideration payout period ending in July 2025, payable in cash. The possibility of
achieving any remaining revenue targets to trigger additional consideration is remote. Accordingly, contingent consideration
remaining for the BLI acquisition at September 30, 2024 is calculated at the present value of the estimated remaining 
million cash discounted at risk-free interest rates from the estimated payment dates. The range of potential additional contingent
consideration related to BLI in excess of the amounts reflected on the balance sheet at September 30, 2024 is 
to 
million (which is considered remote and no provision is made for it), of which up to 
million is in cash and the remainder in the form of Company common stock (with share conversion at a 
per share floor price). 

The
change in fair value of contingent consideration for BLI for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a non-cash expense of approximately
 million included as change in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
This reflects the change in the time value of money related to the present value of payment calculation. 

The
change in fair value of contingent consideration for XR Terra, LLC XRT for the three months ended September 30, 2024
was a non-cash gain of approximately million included as change in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations. This reflects the reversal of the estimated final consideration payment related to the acquisition
of XRT. The contingent consideration payout period ended September 2024. 

As
of June 30, 2024, the Company s contingent consideration liabilities current and non-current balances were as follows:

projections for BLI are expected to trigger potential additional gross consideration of million over the remainder of the contingent

The

Total
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2.44 million compared to approximately 3.10 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 21 . The decrease reflects our Strategic Shift, which has resulted
in a significant turnover in our historical customer base and the divestiture of, and consolidation of, several of our entities. 

We
break out our revenues into two main categories - Software Services and Software License. 

Software
 Services revenues are primarily comprised of Immersive technology projects, services related
 to our software licenses and consulting retainers. 

Software
 License revenues are comprised of the sale of our internally developed Immersive technology
 software as licenses or as software-as-a-service (SaaS). 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, Software Services revenue was approximately 2.23 million compared to approximately 3.01
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 26 . The decrease reflects our Strategic Shift and
the divestiture of, and consolidation of, several of our entities. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, Software License revenue was approximately 0.21 million compared to approximately 0.09 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the addition of one significant customer in 2024.

Customer
Concentration 

Two
customers accounted for approximately 57 (29 and 28 , respectively) of the Company s total gross revenues during the three months

of the Company s total gross revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

License revenues. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, internal staffing was approximately 0.43 million (83 of total cost of goods sold)
and approximately 0.65 million (55 of total cost of goods sold), respectively. The increase in internal staffing as a percentage of
total cost of goods sold was due to our Strategic Shift.

expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 2.96 million compared to approximately 2.09 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 42 . The increase reflects expense reductions driven by reduced
revenue and non-strategic business divestitures more than offset by the non-cash 2023 gain in change in fair value of acquisition contingent
consideration not occurring in 2024. 

30 

Research
and Development 

Research
and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 1.12 million compared to approximately 1.68
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 33 . This decrease represents expense reductions,
primarily headcount related, driven by reduced revenue and non-strategic business divestitures. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 0.94 million compared to approximately
 1.10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 15 . The decrease was driven by headcount reductions
along with reduced corporate overhead expenses. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 0.74 million compared to approximately 0.81
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 9 . This decrease represents expense reductions, primarily
headcount related, driven by reduced revenue and non-strategic business divestitures. This is partially offset by a 2023 non-cash gain
in the change in fair value of stock-based incentive compensation not occurring in 2024. 

Amortization
of Acquisition Intangible Assets 

Amortization
of acquisition intangible assets expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 0.13 million compared to approximately
 0.37 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 65 . The decrease is attributable to the write
off in the prior fiscal year of certain customer relationship intangible assets and divestiture of a certain entity. 

Intangible
Asset Impairment 

Intangible
asset impairment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was zero compared to approximately 0.89 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The 2023 impairment represents the write-off of goodwill and the net intangible asset - technology attributable
to the divestiture a certain entity. 

Change
in Fair Value of Acquisition Contingent Consideration 

Change
in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a expense of approximately 0.03
million compared to a gain of approximately 2.76 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 represents the change in the present value of BLI cash contingent
consideration. The gain in 2023 was driven by a decrease in the common stock price of Glimpse between measurement dates related to BLI
and S5D contingent consideration measured in Company stock. 

Net
Loss 

Net
loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 1.02 million and 0.12 million, respectively, a loss increase
of approximately 0.90 million. This reflects the 2023 non-cash gain in the change in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration
not occurring in 2024 partially offset by expense reductions driven by reduced revenue and non-strategic business divestitures. 

31 

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

The
following discussion and analysis includes both financial measures in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ),
as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance,
financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly
comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to,
and should not be considered as alternatives to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), and cash flow from operating activities,
liquidity or any other financial measures. They may not be indicative of the historical operating results of the Company nor are they
intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes
for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our management uses and relies on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are
non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that both management and shareholders benefit from referring to the aforementioned non-GAAP financial
measures in planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. 

Our
management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate
period-to-period comparisons. Our management recognizes that the non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations because of the
described excluded items. 

The
Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as income (or loss) from continuing operations before the items in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA is
an important measure of our operating performance because it allows management, investors and analysts to evaluate and assess our core
operating results from period-to-period after removing the impact of items of a non-operational nature that affect comparability. 

We
have included a reconciliation of our financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to the most comparable non-GAAP financial
measures. We believe that providing the non-GAAP financial measures, together with the reconciliation to GAAP, helps investors make comparisons
between the Company and other companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use
different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition
being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding GAAP measures provided by each company under applicable
SEC rules. 

The
following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

EBITDA loss was 0.46 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.29 million loss for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. This improvement reflects expense reductions, primarily headcount related, driven by reduced revenue and non-strategic
business divestitures. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. This evaluation
initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management s plans that have not been fully implemented
as of the date the financial statements are issued. 

32 

The
Company has incurred recurring losses since its inception, including a net loss of 1.02 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 64.05 million. While the Company has been
reducing its expense base, it expects to continue to generate negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. The Company expects that
its cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 may not be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months from
the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements and the Company will need to obtain additional funding. Accordingly,
the Company has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period
of at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Outside
of potential revenue growth generated by the Company, in order to alleviate the going concern the Company may take actions which could
include, but are not limited to, further cost reductions, equity or debt financings and restructuring of potential future cash contingent
acquisition liabilities. There is no assurance that these actions will be taken or be successful if pursued. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described. 

Potential
liquidity resources 

Potential
liquidity resources may include the further sale of common stock pursuant to the unused portion of the Company s 100 million S-3
registration statement filed with the SEC on October 28, 2022 (subject to SEC I.B.6 or baby shelf limitations). Such financing
may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as
of the end of such period. 

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls
and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, we are required to apply judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also
is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

During
the period ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
