NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future revenues; solvency; future industry market conditions; future changes in our capacity and operations; future operating and overhead costs; intellectual property; regulatory and related approvals; the conduct or outcome of pre-clinical or clinical (human) studies; operational and management restructuring activities (including implementation of methodologies and changes in the board of directors); our ability to expand our sales and marketing organizations to address effectively existing and new markets that we intend to target; future employment and contributions of personnel; tax and interest rates; productivity, business process, rationalization, investment, mergers and acquisitions (and related integration activities), consulting, operational, tax, financial and capital projects and/or initiatives; inflationary pressures on the U.S. and global economies, respectively; changes in the legal or regulatory environments; and future working capital, costs, revenues, business opportunities, cash flows, margins, earnings and growth. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, expect, plan, anticipate, could, "would," intend, target, project, contemplate, believe, estimate, predict, potential , or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. 
 
 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the factors described under the sections in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q titled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. 
 
 You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.

 Overview 
 
 AVITA Medical, Inc. we , our , us is a commercial-stage regenerative medicine company transforming the standard of care in wound care management and skin restoration with innovative devices. At the forefront of our portfolio is our patented and proprietary RECELL System RECELL System or RECELL ), approved by the U.S. Food Drug Administration (the FDA for the treatment of thermal burn wounds and full-thickness skin defects, and for repigmentation of stable depigmented vitiligo lesions. RECELL harnesses the regenerative properties of a patient s own skin to create an autologous skin cell suspension, Spray-On Skin Cells, delivering a transformative solution at the point of care. This breakthrough technology serves as the catalyst for a new treatment paradigm enabling improved clinical outcomes. In the United States, we also hold the rights to market, sell, and distribute PermeaDerm , a biosynthetic wound matrix, under the terms of an exclusive multi-year distribution agreement (the "Stedical Agreement") with Stedical Scientific, Inc. Stedical ). We also entered into an exclusive multi-year development and distribution agreement with Collagen Matrix, Inc. dba Regenity Biosciences Regenity ). Following FDA 510(k) clearance, Regenity will manufacture and supply Cohealyx , an AVITA Medical-branded collagen-based dermal matrix. Under the agreement, we will hold the exclusive rights to market, sell, and distribute Cohealyx in the U.S., with potential expansion into the European Union, Australia, and Japan. 
 
 The single-use RECELL Autologous Cell Harvesting Device RECELL Ease-of-Use or RECELL EOU is approved by the FDA for the treatment of thermal burn wounds and full-thickness skin defects, and repigmentation of stable depigmented vitiligo lesions. Our next-generation device, RECELL GO Autologous Cell Harvesting Device RECELL GO ), is FDA-approved to treat thermal burn wounds and full-thickness skin defects. RECELL GO introduces enhanced features that streamline the preparation of Spray-On Skin Cells and improves workflow efficiency in the operating room. It consists of two components: the RECELL GO Processing Device (the RPD and the RECELL GO Preparation Kit (the RPK ). The RPD is a multi-use, AC-powered device that controls the RPK. The RPK is a single-use cartridge that contains the RECELL Enzyme . The RPD regulates the pressure applied to disaggregate the cells and precisely controls the incubation time of the RECELL Enzyme to optimize cell yield and promote cell viability. 
 
 We are focused on becoming the leading provider of regenerative medicine addressing unmet medical needs in burn injuries, full-thickness skin defects, and in-skin repigmentation, such as vitiligo. We will continue to drive commercial revenue growth to generate positive cash flow and achieve operating profit. To achieve these objectives, we intend to: 
 
 Become the standard of care in the U.S. burn care market by increasing penetration and adoption in burn centers with our recently FDA-approved RECELL GO 

Expand adoption of RECELL technology for the treatment of full-thickness skin defects in the U.S. with RECELL GO 

27 

Launch RECELL GO mini, which is designed to address smaller wounds, following FDA approval in December of 2024 

Launch Cohealyx after FDA 510(k) clearance anticipated to be received in December of 2024 

Expand our global presence within the U.K., the European Union and Australia through the exclusive use of third-party distributors 

Continue to grow commercial activities in Japan through our partnership with COSMOTEC Company, Ltd COSMOTEC by leveraging our current Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act approval for RECELL with an indication in burns 

Continue to pursue business development opportunities that are complementary to our core RECELL technology and/or our targeted markets, such as our exclusive distribution agreements with Stedical and Regenity 

Expect post-market study, TONE, and the health care economics study, both related to our vitiligo initiative to be published in early 2025 

Business Environment and Current Trends 
 
 The macroeconomic environment may have unexpected adverse effects on businesses and healthcare institutions globally that may negatively impact our consolidated operating results. There remains significant uncertainty in the current macroeconomic environment due to factors including supply chain shortages, increased cost of healthcare, changes to inflation rates, a competitive labor market, and other related global economic conditions and geopolitical conditions. If these conditions continue or worsen, they could adversely impact our future operating results. 
 
 Changes in reimbursement rates by third party payors may place additional financial pressure on hospitals and the broader healthcare system. Healthcare institutions may take actions to mitigate any persistent pressures on their budgets and such actions could impact the future demand for our products. Geopolitical conditions may also impact our operations. Although we do not have operations in Russia, Ukraine or in the Middle East, the continuation of the military conflicts in these regions and/or an escalation of the conflicts beyond their current scope may further weaken the global economy that could result in additional inflationary pressures or supply chain constraints. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 On January 10, 2024, we entered into the Stedical Agreement, an exclusive multi-year distribution agreement with Stedical to commercialize PermeaDerm Biosynthetic Wound Matrix PermeaDerm in the United States. PermeaDerm is cleared by the FDA as a transparent matrix for use in the treatment of a variety of wound types until healing is achieved. Under the terms of the Stedical Agreement, we hold the exclusive rights to market, sell, and distribute PermeaDerm products, including any future enhancements or modifications, within the United States. The initial term is for five years, with the option to renew for an additional five years, contingent upon meeting certain minimum requirements. 
 
 On February 16, 2024, we amended our contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, under the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services BARDA ), dated September 29, 2015, to extend the term through September 28, 2025. Under the modified contract, BARDA will have access to our RECELL inventory in the event of a national emergency. In the case of a national emergency, BARDA will pay for RECELL devices at a reduced price for the first 1,000 units and will then pay retail price for any additional units. No additional inventory build will be required as part of this modification as we have sufficient inventory in stock to fulfill this requirement. BARDA will pay us approximately 333,000 in maintenance fees over the term of the contract to ensure its first right of access to our RECELL inventory. 
 
 On May 29, 2024, the FDA approved our premarket approval PMA supplement for RECELL GO, our next generation autologous cell harvesting device, to treat thermal burn wounds and full-thickness skin defects. Following this approval, we shipped the first RECELL GO order on May 30, 2024, to accommodate the first case for its use on May 31, 2024. 
 
 On June 28, 2024, we submitted a PMA supplement for RECELL GO mini, which is designed to address small wounds up to 480 cm 2 . This version retains the same multi-use processing units as RECELL GO but features a smaller cartridge designed for the smaller donor skin samples needed for smaller wounds. This submission maintains the FDA Breakthrough Device designation from predecessor devices, providing a prioritized 180-day review period. 
 
 On July 31, 2024, we entered into a multi-year exclusive development and distribution agreement with Regenity to market, sell, and distribute Cohealyx , an AVITA-Medical branded collagen-based dermal matrix in the U.S., with the potential to commercialize the product in the European Union, Japan, and Australia.

 Total revenues increased by 43.2 , or 5.9 million, to 19.5 million, compared to 13.6 million in the same period in the prior year. Our commercial revenue was 19.5 million in the three-months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.9 million, or 43.8 , compared to 13.5 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. The growth in commercial revenues was largely driven by deeper penetration within customer accounts and new accounts for full-thickness skin defects. 
 
 Gross profit margin was 83.7 compared to 84.5 in the corresponding period in the prior year. The decrease in this quarter was due to ongoing engineering and validation of the RECELL GO durable and disposable cartridge. 
 
 BARDA income decreased to zero, compared to 0.2 million in the corresponding period in the prior year due to ending of reimbursable clinical trials. BARDA income in the prior year consisted of funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, under the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under ongoing USG Contract No. HHSO100201500028C. 

Total operating expenses increased by 43.3 or 9.1 million to 30.2 million, compared with 21.1 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 43.8 , or 4.6 million, to 15.1 million, compared to 10.5 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. Higher costs in the current year are due to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately 1.9 million, commissions expense of 1.9 million, and stock-based compensation expense of 0.4 million, plus 0.4 million in other selling expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits is due to the expansion of the sales force to support our growing commercial capabilities. Higher commissions were directly associated with the increase in revenues. The increase stock-based compensation is due to additional grants related to the expansion of the sales force. 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 56.6 , or 3.5 million, to 9.6 million, compared to 6.1 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase was attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation of 1.3 million, an increase in salaries and benefits of 1.1 million, an increase in severance benefits of 0.1 million, an increase of 0.5 million in deferred compensation expenses, and an increase of 0.5 million in professional fees, offset by lower other corporate expenses. The increase in stock-based compensation and salaries and benefits are primarily attributable to headcount growth to support the expansion of our business. The increased severance payments is due to termination payments for two former executives. The increase in deferred compensation expense is driven by higher stock price used to calculate the deferred compensation liability for the deferred restricted stock awards. 
 29 

Research and development expenses increased by 23.5 , or 1.0 million, to 5.4 million, compared to 4.4 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in salaries and benefits of approximately 0.8 million was due to the increase in headcount resulting from the deployment of a team of Medical Science Liaisons, an increase in development costs of 0.2 million, an increase of 0.1 million in deferred compensation expenses, and an increase to all other development expenses of 0.2 million, offset by a decrease in professional fees of approximately 0.3 million due to higher expenses in the prior period related to RECELL GO and full-thickness skin defects. 
 
 Interest expense increased approximately 1.3 million in comparison to the same period in the prior year due to the interest expense related to the long-term debt as part of the OrbiMed Credit Agreement, for an aggregate principal amount owed of 40.0 million. 
 
 Other (expense) income, net decreased by 1.7 million to expense of 1.1 million from income of 0.6 million in the prior period. In the current period, other (expense) income consists of non-cash charges of 1.0 million and 0.8 million related to the changes in fair value of the debt and warrant liability, respectively, offset by 0.6 million in income related to our investments and 0.1 million in other gains, net. The prior period income consisted of 0.7 million related to our investments offset by 0.1 million in other losses, net.

Total revenues increased by 27.5 , or 9.9 million, to 45.8 million, compared to 35.9 million in the same period in the prior year. Our commercial revenue was 45.7 million in the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 10.0 million, or 28.1 , compared to 35.7 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. The growth in commercial revenues was largely driven by deeper penetration within customer accounts and new accounts for full-thickness skin defect. 
 
 Gross profit margin was 85.1 compared to 83.4 in the corresponding period in the prior year. This increase was largely driven by increases in both revenues and the volume of production. 
 
 BARDA income decreased to zero, compared to 1.4 million in the corresponding period in the prior year due to the ending of reimbursable clinical trials. BARDA income in the prior year consisted of funding received from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, under the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under ongoing USG Contract No. HHSO100201500028C. 

Total operating expenses increased by 38.8 or 24.0 million to 85.7 million, compared with 61.7 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. 
 
 30 

Sales and marketing expenses increased by 62.8 , or 17.0 million, to 44.1 million, compared to 27.1 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. Higher costs in the current year were primarily related to increases in salaries and benefits and personnel expenses of approximately 7.2 million, commissions expense of 4.9 million, stock-based compensation expense of 1.7 million, 1.0 million in other selling expenses, 0.9 million in professional fees, 0.7 million in travel expenses, and 0.2 million in rent expense, plus 0.4 million in all other expenses, net. The increase in salaries and benefits, personnel related expenses, stock-based compensation, travel expenses, and other selling expenses are due to the expansion of the sales force to support our growing commercial capabilities. Higher commissions were directly associated with the increase in revenues. The increase in professional fees are primarily due to consulting expenses related to our foreign distribution network. The increase in rent is due to increased office space to accommodate our growing operations. 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 26.7 , or 5.5 million, to 26.1 million, compared to 20.6 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase was attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits and personnel expenses of 3.2 million, an increase in stock-based compensation of 2.0 million, an increase in professional fees of 0.4 million, and an increase of 0.2 million in travel expenses plus an increase in other corporate expenses of 0.3 million, partially offset by lower deferred compensation expenses of 0.6 million. The increase in salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation are primarily attributable to headcount growth to support the expansion of our business. The decrease in deferred compensation expense is driven by a lower stock price used to calculate the deferred compensation liability for the deferred restricted stock awards. 
 
 Research and development expenses increased by 10.3 , or 1.4 million, to 15.5 million, compared to 14.1 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits of 2.6 million, an increase in stock-based compensation of 0.4 million, and an increase of 0.3 million in travel expenses, due to the increase in headcount resulting from the deployment of Medical Science Liaisons plus higher other development expenses of 0.8 million, offset by lower professional fees and development expenses of approximately 2.7 million related to RECELL GO and full-thickness skin defects. 
 
 Interest expense increased approximately 4.0 million in comparison to the same period in the prior year due to the interest expense related to the long-term debt as part of the OrbiMed Credit Agreement, for an aggregate principal amount owed of 40.0 million. 
 
 Other income, net decreased by 1.7 million or 77.7 to income of 0.5 million. In the current period other income, net consists of 2.3 million in income related to our investments, 0.4 million due to the change in fair value of warrant liability, and 0.4 million in other gains, net, offset by a non-cash charge of 2.6 million due to the change in fair value of the debt. In the prior period, income consisted of 2.0 million related to our investments and 0.1 million in other gains, net. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 We expect to utilize cash reserves until U.S. sales of our products reach a level sufficient to fund ongoing operations. We have historically funded research and development activities, and more recently have funded a substantial investment in sales and marketing activities, through raising capital by issuing securities and the issuance of debt. On October 18, 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement with an affiliate of OrbiMed Advisors, LLC. The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year senior secured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 90.0 million, of which 40.0 million was drawn during the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, an aggregate of 50.0 million will be made available in two separate 25.0 million tranches, at our discretion, subject to certain net revenue requirements. The first tranche of 25.0 million is available on or before December 31, 2024. The second tranche of 25.0 million is available on or prior to June 30, 2025, and only if the first tranche was drawn upon. We have monthly interest rate payments for the debt at a rate equal to the greater of (a) forward-looking one-month term SOFR rate and (b) four percent (4.0 per annum, plus eight percent (8.0 ). In the event that we do not meet certain 12-month trailing revenue targets at the end of certain fiscal quarters, starting December 31, 2024, the outstanding balance of the loan must be repaid in equal quarterly installments of 5.0 of the funded amount through the maturity date. As of September 30, 2024, our projected revenues, for the trailing 12 months ending December 31, 2024, will exceed the minimum revenue requirements under the Credit Agreement. On November 7, 2024, we amended the Credit Agreement, see Note 16, Subsequent Events of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 We had approximately 18.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and 25.8 million in marketable securities as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 As of the date of these financial statements, we believe we have sufficient cash reserves to fund operations for the next 12-months.

Net cash used in operating activities was 40.9 million and 27.1 million during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase in net cash used in operations was primarily due to higher operating costs. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 34.9 million and 58.9 million during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities is primarily attributable to higher cash outflows from purchases of marketable securities and lower cash inflows from maturities of marketable securities in the current year compared to the prior year, offset primarily by an increase in cash outflow for capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures in the current year is primarily related to the leasehold improvement in the Ventura production facility to enhance manufacturing output and materials related to our RECELL GO RPDs. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 2.5 million and 0.9 million during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities is related to proceeds from the exercises of stock options and purchases of stock under the ESPP plan. 
 
 Capital Management and Material Cash Requirements 
 
 We aim to manage capital so that the Company continues as a going concern while also maintaining optimal returns to stockholders and benefits for other stakeholders. We also aim to maintain a capital structure that ensures the lowest cost of capital available to us. We regularly review our capital structure and seek to take advantage of available opportunities to improve outcomes for us and our stockholders. 
 
 For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, there were no dividends paid and we have no plans to commence the payment of dividends. As part of the Stedical Agreement, we have an obligation to Stedical to purchase sufficient products to achieve 5.0 million in customer sales. As of September 30, 2024, we have fulfilled this obligation. Under the terms of our exclusive development and distribution agreement with Regenity, we will make a 2.0 million payment upon receipt of 510(k) clearance by Regenity. We have a further obligation to make up to an additional 3.0 million payment on or before January 4, 2026 to guarantee development and manufacturing capacity (and related resources), contingent on positive results of certain clinical studies. With the exception of the milestone payments related to our exclusive development and distribution agreement with Regenity, we do not have any other purchase commitments or long-term contractual obligations except for lease obligations as of September 30, 2024. In addition, we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in the applicable rules and regulations established by the SEC) that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. While have no committed plans to issue further shares on the market, we will continue to assess market conditions.

 7. Binding Arbitration 

Any and all disputes which involve or relate in any way to this Agreement and/or to Executive s employment or termination of employment as CLO of the Company, whether initiated by Executive or by the Company and whether based on contract, tort, statute, or common law, shall be submitted to and resolved by final, binding and confidential arbitration as the exclusive method for resolving all such disputes. The arbitration shall be private and confidential and conducted in Los Angeles, California pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable California law, and pursuant to the applicable rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services JAMS relating to employment disputes, unless the parties otherwise mutually agree to modify the JAMS Rules. A copy of the AAA Employment Rules are available for review at https://ww w.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration and are incorporated herein by reference. 
 The party demanding arbitration shall submit a written claim to the other party, setting out the basis of the claim or claims, within the time period of any applicable statute of limitations relating to such claim(s). If the parties cannot mutually agree upon an arbitrator, then the parties shall select a neutral arbitrator through the procedures established by the AAA. The arbitrator shall have the powers provided under the Federal Arbitration Act relating to the arbitration of disputes, except as expressly limited or otherwise provided in this Agreement. The parties shall have the right to reasonable discovery. The parties agree that the Company shall pay the administration costs of the AAA arbitration, including payment of the fees for the Arbitrator, and any other costs directly related to the administration of the arbitration. The parties shall otherwise be responsible for their own respective costs and attorneys' fees relating to the dispute, such as deposition costs, expert witnesses and similar expenses, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement to the prevailing party. 
 The Arbitrator may award, if properly proven, any damages or remedy that a party could recover in a civil litigation and shall award costs and reasonable attorneys fees to the 
 8 

prevailing party as provided by law. The award of the Arbitrator shall be issued in writing, setting forth the basis for the decision, and shall be binding on the parties to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject to any limited statutory right to appeal as provided by law. 
 Judgment upon the award of the Arbitrator may be entered in any state or federal court sitting in Los Angeles, California. 
 Nothing in this Section shall prevent Executive from filing or maintaining a claim for workers compensation, state disability insurance, or unemployment insurance benefits, and nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent or excuse Executive or the Company from using existing internal procedures for the resolution of complaints. Employee may bring claims before administrative agencies when the law permits the agency to adjudicate those claims, even when there is an agreement to arbitrate; examples include claims or charges with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (or comparable state agency), the National Labor Relations Board, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Nothing in this Section shall require arbitration of disputes that are excluded from coverage by this section or by law. 
 The Company and Executive agree that any dispute in arbitration will be brought on an individual basis only, and not on a class, collective, or representative basis on behalf of others (this agreement to be referred to hereafter as the Class Action Waiver ). The Class Action Waiver does not apply to any claim that Executive brings on behalf of both herself and others under the California Private Attorney General Act of 2004. Executive will not be subject to any retaliation or discrimination if Executive seeks to challenge this arbitration provision or participate in a class, collective, or representative action in any forum, but Company may lawfully seek enforcement of this Agreement under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of any class, collective, or representative actions or claims to the fullest extent allowed by law. 
 8. Governing Law 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to contracts made and to be carried out in California. Each of the parties agrees to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Los Angeles, California in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

Any payments to be made under this Agreement upon a termination of employment shall only be made if such termination of employment constitutes a separation from service under Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement comply with Section 409A and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by Employee on account of non-compliance with Section 409A.
