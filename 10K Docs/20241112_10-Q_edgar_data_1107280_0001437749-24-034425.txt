FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements for the purposes of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as plan , may , will , expect , intend , anticipate , believe , estimate and continue or similar words. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts, and include, but are not limited to: 

statements regarding our products and services, including: 

our digital watermarking technology and Cloud-based document protection system; 

our data privacy and data protection services and solutions; our technology, our cash needs, including our ability to fund our future capital expenditures and working capital requirements; 

our expectations regarding competition and growth in our sector; the future sources and availability of additional funding; and 

the effect of funding arrangements on projects and products. 

You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations and plans, which contain projections of future results of operations or financial condition or state other forward-looking information. We believe that it is important to communicate future expectations to investors. However, there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Accordingly, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future, except as required by law. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations about future events affecting the Company and are subject to uncertainties and factors that affect all business operating in a global market as well as matters specific to the Company. These uncertainties and factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are beyond the Company s control. Factors to consider when evaluating these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 

the impact of pandemics; 

the Company s limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its business and prospects; 

the Company has incurred substantial losses and expects to incur losses in the future and may never achieve profitability; 

if the Company is unable to obtain substantial additional financing, it may not be able to remain in business; 

the Company s operating results in future periods are expected to be subject to significant fluctuations, which would likely affect the trading price of the Company s common shares; 

the data privacy and data protection markets are highly competitive, and the Company s failure to successfully compete will limit its ability to attain, retain and increase its market share; 

the document protection market is highly competitive, and the Company s failure to compete successfully would limit its ability to retain and increase its market share; 

the video digital watermarking business is highly competitive, and the Company s failure to compete successfully would limit its ability to retain and increase its market share; 

the Company is subject to rapid technological change, which could render its products and services obsolete; 

the Company is dependent upon vendors and other third-party service providers and will be competing with some of these companies; 

the Company s services are technically complex, and it may not be able to prevent defects that could decrease their market acceptance, result in product liability, or harm its reputation; 

any loss of the Company s personnel or inability to acquire new personnel could harm its business; 

a failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have material adverse effect on the Company s business and operating results and shareholders could lose confidence in the Company s financial reporting; 

the Company does not currently have any paying customers; 

the Company s business may suffer if it cannot protect its intellectual property; 

the Company s products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, causing the Company to incur significant costs or prevent us from licensing its products; 

the Company s success depends on the continued growth in demand for e-business applications; 

government regulation and legal uncertainties could add additional costs and risks to doing business on the Internet; 

the Company s share price has been and could be highly volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors; 

the Company has not paid cash dividends in the past and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Table of Contents 

Any return on investment may be limited to the value of the Company s common shares; 

securities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover the Company s common shares, and this may have a negative impact on its market price; 

anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could prevent or delay a change in control of the Company; 

the Company intends to issue additional equity securities, which may dilute the interests of current shareholders or carry rights or preferences senior to the common shares; 

the exercise of options and warrants and other issuances of common shares or securities convertible into or exercisable for common shares will dilute the ownership interest of the Company s current shareholders and may adversely affect the future market price of the Company s common shares; 

limited liability of executive officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against them; 

requirements of the SEC with regard to low-priced penny stocks may adversely affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares in the secondary market; 

the Company does not anticipate paying dividends to shareholders in the foreseeable future; 

the Company may be exposed to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could harm the Company s financial results and cash flows; 

service outages and disruption of the Company s infrastructure may harm the Company and adversely impact business operations and injure reputation; 

security vulnerabilities in the Company s products and services or any breach of the Company s security measures may injure its reputation and disrupt the Company s business; 

the financial reporting obligations of being a public company in the United States are expensive, time consuming, and may place significant demands on the Company s management; and 

the Company s failure to manage or adequately address any one or more of these risks could result in the business suffering a material adverse effect. 

The Company believes the items outlined above are important factors that could cause estimates included in its financial statements to differ materially from the actual results and those expressed in a forward-looking statement made in this report or elsewhere by the Company or on its behalf. The Company has discussed these factors in more detail under Risk Factors in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and other periodic reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Accordingly, to the extent that this quarterly report contains forward-looking statements regarding the financial condition, operating results, business prospects or any other aspect of the Company, please be advised that the Company s actual financial condition, operating results and business performance may differ materially from that projected or estimated by the Company in forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update our description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises, except as required by applicable securities laws and regulations. We advise our shareholders that they should (i) be aware that factors not referred to above could affect the accuracy of the Company s forward-looking statements and (ii) use caution when considering the Company s forward-looking statements.

OCULUS VISIONTECH INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 
 (Stated in US Dollars) 
 (Unaudited) 

for the period ended September 30, 2024 and, in addition the Company incurred losses of for the period ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of and a working capital deficiency of . As a result of the Company s current financial position and challenging access to capital, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds in the future, in which case the Company will be unable to meet its financial obligations. These material uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments to amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue operations. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its obligations as they come due which management believes it will be able to do. To date, the Company has funded operations primarily through the issuance of common stock and warrants to outside investors and the Company s management. The Company believes that its operations will generate additional funds and that additional funding from outside investors and the Company s management will continue to be available to the Company when needed. 
 
 There are many external factors that can adversely affect general workforces, economies and financial markets globally. Examples include, but are not limited to, political conflict in other regions. It is not possible for the Company to predict the duration or magnitude of adverse results of such external factors and their effect on the Company s business or ability to raise funds. 

Control is defined as the exposure, or rights, to variable returns from involvement with an investee and the ability to affect those returns through power over the investee. Power over an investee exists when an investor has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the activities that significantly affect the investee s returns. This control is generally evidenced through owning more than 50 of the voting rights or currently exercisable potential voting rights of a Company s capital stock. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
 
 The controlled entities are listed in the following table: 
 
 Software Development 

Research and development 
 
 Expenditures on research activities is recognized on the condensed interim consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss as incurred. Development expenditures are capitalized as part of the cost of the resulting intangible asset only if the expenditures can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Company intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Management determined that as at September 30, 2024, it was not yet able to demonstrate with sufficient certainty that it is probable that any economic benefits will flow to the Company. Accordingly, all research and development costs incurred to date have been expensed.

 OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY 
 
 Oculus VisionTech Inc. (OVTZ) is a Canadian-based development-stage technology company focused on cyber security, data privacy and data protection solutions for Enterprise business customers. Headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the company was originally founded by image processing experts and is operated by experienced leadership. Currently, OVTZ is expanding and investing in a suite of new data protection and data privacy security products that will revolutionize CCPA, GDPR, LGPD and other data privacy legislation compliance for both data subjects and data controllers worldwide. Our mission is innovation of viable software tools that enable intelligent automated solutions for public cloud customer services and needs specific to data privacy and data protection for individuals, organizations and their customers worldwide, through a vision of mutually trusted data compliance. 
 
 Our Forget-Me-Yes data privacy product is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform developed to specifically address the global Right-to-be-Forgotten (RtbF) and Right-of-Erase (RoE) legal components of Brazil s LGPD, Europe s GDPR, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) and Virginia CDPA data privacy regulatory compliance. An additional new data protection software tool, ComplyScan , is being developed to address public cloud data governance compliance. Our legacy Cloud Document Protection System (Cloud-DPS) technology leveraged our digital watermarking technology to enable OVTZ to offer a SaaS-based document management platform for tamper-proof document authentication and protection. Historically, we have used our digital watermarking technology for streaming video content distribution based on embedded digital watermarking, as well as video-on-demand (VOD) systems, services and source-to-destination digital media delivery solutions that allow live or recorded digitized and compressed video to be transmitted through Internet, intranet, satellite or wireless connectivity. 
 
 We were incorporated on April 18, 1986, as "First Commercial Financial Group Inc." in the Province of Alberta, Canada. In 1989, our name was changed to "Micron Metals Canada Corp.", which purchased 100 of the outstanding shares of USA Video Inc., a Texas corporation, in order to focus on the digital media business. In 1995, we changed our name to "USA Video Interactive Corp." and continued out of the Province of Alberta into the State of Wyoming. At a shareholders meeting held on December 30, 2011, a resolution was passed to change our name to "Oculus VisionTech Inc." and to alter our share capital by way of a reverse stock split (share consolidation) on the basis of fifteen old common shares for one new common share. On January 25, 2012, we changed our name to "Oculus VisionTech Inc." In June 2020, OVTZ acquired OCL Technologies Inc. (OCL), a Delaware corporation data privacy software development startup based in San Diego, California. As a 100 wholly-owned subsidiary of OVTZ and to better align with customer and market focus, OCL has completed a corporate name change to ComplyTrust Inc. (CTI) on January 21, 2021. All OCL references throughout this document are synonymous with the new name change, CTI.

 BUSINESS OBJECTIVES: 
 
 In this age of digital transformation, data monetization, IoT, and massive data migration to converged hyperscale, geo-disbursed Cloud infrastructure and workloads, data protection and data privacy have taken center stage. GDPR, LGPD, CCPA, and many other new international (Canada/PIPEDA, China/PIPL, India/DIA) and upcoming US Federal (ADPPA) and individual State data privacy regulations enable individuals and organizations the right to access and request deletion of all personal information for a given data subject. In our ever increasing Everything-as-a-Service world, OVTZ recognizes the need for global cloud-native data privacy and data protection solutions that are multi-cloud platform-ready and can augment both existing legacy and newer agile-driven architectures. OVTZ is building modular microservices-based software solutions and services for both hybrid on-premise and multi-cloud data management that incorporate automated malware, privacy and ransomware scanning, reporting, visualization and cyber threat management. 
 
 Our new Forget-Me-Yes (FMY) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) data privacy solution is a secure, Zero-Knowledge platform providing a single-source capability of continuous right-to-be-forgotten (RtbF) and right-of-erase (RoE) privacy compliance by incorporating automated policy-driven re-query services that guarantees a Data Subject s requested RtbF/RoE data remains forgotten over the life of their FMY subscription. FMY incorporates hybrid encryption technology that ensures all User Interface, data-in-transit and data-at-rest remain secure and can only be accessed by the subscriber. With a cloud-native architecture, the FMY functionality can be utilized as either a complete turnkey SaaS subscription platform, or individually licensed for seamless integration with existing 3rd party applications and data privacy platforms. 
 
 Our new ComplyTrust Software-as-a-Service Suite (CTSS) is a set of software tools specifically designed to address cloud-native data management and regulatory compliant data governance. CTSS will help to remove enterprise organizational barriers and blockers to further enable successful cloud migration and deployment that benefit the cloud infrastructure providers, enterprise organizations, and users collectively. CTSS helps to automate and visualize cloud compliance reporting across accounts, regions and services based on a variety of user-definable and data driven metrics. Development of the first CTSS product, a cloud-native data backup compliance reporting tool called ComplyScan (CS), has commenced. 
 
 OVTZ had recognized that cloud-based, digital document security/protection products were a potentially viable business opportunity for the Company that allowed us to apply our proprietary real-time digital video watermarking technology, originally developed for studios and networks in the entertainment industry, to the digital document security/protection market. Cloud-DPS secures and protects digital documents (including text documents, photos, blueprints, etc.) from any modification, and/or attempted forgery by imperceptibly watermarking documents, using real-time image processing and watermarking algorithms, embedded into a secured/protected copy of a document. This authentication and verification process ensures the integrity of the original digital document. 
 
 Our near-term business objectives for the above: 

1. 
 Copyright, patent and license new technology developed within the corporate research and development program; 

2. 
 Demonstrate proof of concept on selected commercial projects with our introductory Forget-Me-Yes (FMY) data privacy Software-as-a-Service platform, incorporate additional connectors for Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) providers for MySQL, NoSQL and SQL databases, for both structured and unstructured data, and license FMY API microservices for integration with 3rd. party application partners, software providers and potential OEM s. 

3. 
 Demonstrate ComplyTrust SaaS Suite (CTSS) proof of concept for the data protection market first as an Amazon Web Services (AWS) tool to help AWS customers better manage organizational data protection and compliance in an automated and cloud-native fashion, and as customer attainment increases, incorporate CTSS features to perform applicable custom data governance and management functionality, and integrate with 3rd. party software providers to provide an automated single-pane-of-glass solution for enterprise organizations worldwide. 

4. 
 Gain industry recognition for the architectural and business differentiators of the company s FMY data privacy, ComplyScan (CS) compliance validation tool and our legacy C-DPS authentication/tamper-proof functionality products, and generate recurring sales and support revenue streams.

Net Losses 
 
 Nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 
 
 To date, we have not achieved profitability and expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 231,930 compared with a net loss of 495,818 for the comparative period. 
 
 Three-month period ended September 30, 2024 
 
 To date, we have not achieved profitability and expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 69,143 compared with a net loss of 140,507 for the comparative period. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 At September 30, 2024 our cash and cash equivalents position was 3,486, a decrease from 156,574 at December 31, 2023. We had a working capital deficiency of 316,737 and an accumulated deficit of 48,618,576 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 We have historically satisfied our capital needs primarily by shareholders loans and issuing equity securities to our officers, directors, employees and a small group of investors, and from short-term bridge loans from members of management. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 3,486 in cash. Management has forecasted the Company will not have sufficient working capital to operate for the ensuing 12 months. We will require an additional 3 million to 5 million to finance operations for fiscal 2024 and we intend to obtain such financing through sales of our equity securities. While the Company has been successful in the past in obtaining financing, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financing, or that such financing will be on terms acceptable to the Company, to meet future operational needs which may result in the delay, reduction, or discontinuation of ongoing development programs. 
 
 Assuming the aforementioned 3 million to 5 million in financing is obtained, continuing operations for the longer-term will be supported through anticipated growth in revenues and through additional sales of our securities. Although longer-term financing requirements may vary depending upon our sales performance, management expects that we will require additional financing of 3 million to 5 million for fiscal 2024. We have no binding commitments or arrangements for additional financing, and there is no assurance that management will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
