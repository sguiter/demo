. In April 2024,
the Company sold all of its shares of common stock it held of Eton in a block trade at a gross price of per share. After deducting
trading expenses and commissions of approximately , the Company received net proceeds of and recorded a loss of 
related to the sale of its investment in Eton. 

The
Company s 2026 Notes (as defined in Note 11) are carried at face value, including the unamortized premium, less unamortized debt
issuance costs, the 2027 Notes (as described in Note 11) are carried at face value less unamortized debt issuance costs, and the Oaktree
Loan (as defined in Note 11) is carried at face value less the original issue discount and unamortized debt issuance costs on the condensed
consolidated balance sheets and the Company presents fair value for disclosure purposes only. The 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes are classified
as Level 1 instruments as the fair value is determined using quoted market prices in active markets for the same securities. The Oaktree
Loan is classified as a Level 2 instrument and its fair value is determined through an income approach that considers collateral coverage,
yield calibration, yield analysis and any adjustments to implied yield associated with the Company s fundamental measures. 

2027 Notes 

Oaktree Loan 

The
Company s other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses,
accrued payroll and related liabilities, contingent consideration payable, deferred revenue and customer deposits and operating lease
liabilities. The carrying amount of these financial instruments, except for operating lease liabilities, approximates fair value due
to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company, the carrying value of
the operating lease liabilities approximate their respective fair values.

presented because the effect is anti-dilutive. Included in the basic and diluted net loss per share calculation were RSUs awarded to

and ) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s
effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of due
to state taxes, permanent book-tax differences related to Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Section 162(m) excess officer compensation
limitation, share-based compensation and the change in valuation allowance. In the current period ended September 30, 2024, the Company met the exception to using the estimated annual effective
tax rate. The current period income tax expense reflects year-to-date income tax expense. The prior year third quarter income tax expense
was recorded using the estimated annual effective tax rate. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were unrecognized tax benefits included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets
that would, if recognized, affect the effective tax rate. 

shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock of Melt (representing in aggregate approximately
 of Melt s equity interests as of September 30, 2024). The Company analyzes its investment in Melt and related agreements on
a regular basis to evaluate its position of variable interests in Melt. The Company has determined that it does not have the ability
to control Melt, however it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of Melt. Therefore,
the Company uses the equity method of accounting for the Melt investment. Under this method, the Company recognizes earnings and losses
in Melt in its consolidated financial statements and adjusts the carrying amount of its investment in Melt accordingly. Any intra-entity
profits and losses are eliminated. 

On
a quarterly basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of the Company s equity method
investments may be other than temporarily impaired. Indicators include financial condition, operating performance, and near-term prospects
of the investee. To the extent indicators suggest that a loss in value may have occurred, the Company will evaluate both quantitative
and qualitative factors to determine if the loss in value is other than temporary. If a potential loss in value is determined to be other
than temporary, the Company will recognize an impairment loss based on the estimated fair value of the equity method investments. The
Company has no investments other than its common stock and preferred stock positions in Melt and no other requirements to advance funds
to Melt.

In
November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income Expense Disaggregation
Disclosures, to improve the disclosures by a public business entity about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions.
This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2024-03 on its consolidated financial
statements. 

Intellectual
Property License and Related Arrangements Revenues 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company held five intellectual property licenses and related arrangements pursuant to which the Company has
agreed to license or sell to a customer the right to access the Company s intellectual property. License arrangements may consist
of non-refundable upfront license fees, data transfer fees, research reimbursement payments, exclusive license rights to patented or
patent pending compounds, technology access fees, and various performance or sales milestones. These arrangements can be multiple-element
arrangements, the revenue of which is recognized at the point in time that the performance obligation is met. 

Non-refundable
fees that are not contingent on any future performance by the Company and require no consequential continuing involvement on the part
of the Company are recognized as revenue when the license term commences and the licensed data, technology, compounded drug preparation
and/or other deliverables are delivered. Such deliverables may include physical quantities of compounded drug preparations, design of
the compounded drug preparations and structure-activity relationships, the conceptual framework and mechanism of action, and rights to
the patents or patent applications for such compounded drug preparations. The Company defers recognition of non-refundable fees if it
has continuing performance obligations without which the technology, right, product or service conveyed in conjunction with the non-refundable
fee has no utility to the licensee and that are separate and independent of the Company s performance under the other elements
of the arrangement. In addition, if the Company s continued involvement is required, through research and development services
that are related to its proprietary know-how and expertise of the delivered technology or can only be performed by the Company, then
such non-refundable fees are deferred and recognized over the period of continuing involvement. Guaranteed minimum annual royalties are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable term.

Stock
Option Plan 

On
September 17, 2007, the Company s Board of Directors and stockholders adopted the Company s 2007 Incentive Stock and Awards
Plan, which was subsequently amended on November 5, 2008, February 26, 2012, July 18, 2012, May 2, 2013 and September 27, 2013 (as amended,
the 2007 Plan ). The 2007 Plan reached its term in September 2017, and we can no longer issue additional awards under this
plan, however, options previously issued under the 2007 Plan will remain outstanding until they are exercised, reach their maturity or
are otherwise cancelled/forfeited. On June 13, 2017, the Company s Board of Directors and stockholders adopted the Company s
2017 Incentive Stock and Awards Plan which was subsequently amended on June 3, 2021 (as amended, the 2017 Plan together
with the 2007 Plan, the Plans ). As of September 30, 2024, the 2017 Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum of 
shares of the Company s common stock. The purpose of the Plans are to attract and retain directors, officers, consultants, advisors
and employees whose services are considered valuable, to encourage a sense of proprietorship and to stimulate an active interest of such
persons in the Company s development and financial success. Under the Plans, the Company is authorized to issue incentive stock
options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, non-qualified stock options, RSUs and
restricted stock. The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. The Company had
 shares available for future issuances under the 2017 Plan at September 30, 2024.

have been received by option holders if all option holders had exercised and immediately sold all shares underlying options with an exercise
price lower than the market price on September 30, 2024, based on the closing price of the Company s common stock of on
that date. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted stock options to certain employees. . Certain option awards provide for accelerated vesting
if there is a change in control (as defined in the Plans) and in the event of certain modifications to the option award agreement. 

The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The expected term
of options granted to employees and directors was determined in accordance with the simplified approach, as the Company
has limited, relevant, historical data on employee exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected risk-free
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time
of the grant. The financial statement effect of forfeitures is estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, if the actual
effect differs from those estimates. For option grants to employees and directors, the Company assigns a forfeiture factor of . These
factors could change in the future, which would affect the determination of stock-based compensation expense in future periods.

and professional liability litigation represents an inherent risk to all firms in the pharmaceutical and pharmacy industry. We utilize
traditional third-party insurance policies with regard to our product and professional liability claims. Such insurance coverage at any
given time reflects current market conditions, including cost and availability, when the policy is written. 

Indemnities 

In
addition to the indemnification provisions contained in the Company s charter documents, the Company generally enters into separate
indemnification agreements with each of the Company s directors and officers. These agreements require the Company, among other
things, to indemnify the director or officer against specified expenses and liabilities, such as attorneys fees, judgments, fines
and settlements, paid by the individual in connection with any action, suit or proceeding arising out of the individual s status
or service as the Company s director or officer, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct or conduct that is knowingly
fraudulent or deliberately dishonest, and to advance expenses incurred by the individual in connection with any proceeding against the
individual with respect to which the individual may be entitled to indemnification by the Company. Several of the Company s asset
purchase and license agreements contain customary representations, warranties, covenants and confidentiality provisions, and also contain
mutual indemnification obligations related primarily to performance under the respective agreements. The Company also indemnifies its
lessors in connection with its facility leases for certain claims arising from the use of the facilities. These indemnities do not provide
for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make. Historically, the Company has not
incurred any payments for these obligations and, therefore, no liabilities have been recorded for these indemnities in the accompanying
condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Asset
Purchase, License and Related Agreements 

FDA
Approved Product Acquisitions 

In
recent years, the Company has acquired commercial and product rights to various FDA approved ophthalmic medications and products through
asset purchase, licenses, supply and/or other related agreements. In general, in exchange for product and commercial rights these agreements
provide the counterparties with certain upfront and contingent milestone payments typically related to certain annual sales amounts and
manufacturing events, and in certain cases, per unit transfer prices and royalties on sales of some of the products. During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 
 and ,
respectively, were incurred under these agreements as royalty expenses, and 
 and ,
respectively, during the same periods in 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 
 was incurred under these agreements related to
upfront and milestone payments under these agreements. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company amended
the Sintetica Agreement to allow for early payment of previously accrued amounts for commercial related milestones associated with sales
of IHEEZO in exchange for a reduction in the milestone amounts due, and as a result of this amendment, the Company reduced
the intangible asset value associated with IHEEZO by and paid the remaining commercial milestone amount of .
 As of September 30, 2024, the remaining contingent consideration payable pursuant to these agreements were not considered probable
and reasonably estimable and therefore, no amount was accrued related to these contingent obligations during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024. At the time contingent consideration payable becomes probable and reasonably estimable the additional consideration,
if any, paid will be allocated to the assets based on their initial estimated fair values as a percent of the total purchase price. 

Formulation
Acquisitions 

The
Company has acquired and sourced intellectual property rights related to certain proprietary innovations from certain inventors, innovator
companies and related parties (the Inventors through multiple asset purchase agreements and license agreements. In general,
these agreements provide that the Inventors will cooperate with the Company in obtaining patent protection for the acquired intellectual
property and that the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and commercialize a product based on the
acquired intellectual property. In addition, the Company has acquired a right of first refusal on additional intellectual property and
drug development opportunities presented by these Inventors. 

In
consideration for the acquisition of these intellectual property rights, the Company is obligated to make payments to the Inventors based
on the completion of a milestone, generally consisting of: (1) a payment payable within 30 to 45 days after the issuance of the
first patent in the United States arising from the acquired intellectual property (if any); (2) a payment payable within 30 days after
the Company files the first investigational new drug application IND with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA for the first product arising from the acquired intellectual property (if any); (3) for certain of the Inventors, a payment payable within
30 days after the Company files the first new drug application with the FDA for the first product arising from the acquired intellectual
property (if any); and (4) certain royalty payments based on the net receipts received by the Company in connection with the sale or
licensing of any product based on the acquired intellectual property (if any), after deducting (among other things) the Company s
development costs associated with such product. If, following five years after the date of the applicable asset purchase agreement, the
Company either (a) for certain of the Inventors, has not filed an IND or, for the remaining Inventors, has not initiated a study where
data is derived, or (b) has failed to generate royalty payments to the Inventors for any product based on the acquired intellectual property,
the Inventors may terminate the applicable asset purchase agreement and request that the Company re-assign the acquired technology to
the Inventors. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and , respectively, were incurred under these
agreements as royalty expenses and and , respectively, during the same periods in 2023.

Overview 

We
are a leading eyecare pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative ophthalmic pharmaceutical
products for the U.S. market. Harrow helps U.S. eyecare professionals preserve the gift of sight by making its comprehensive portfolio
of prescription and non-prescription pharmaceutical products accessible and affordable to millions of Americans each year. We own commercial
rights to one of the largest portfolios of branded ophthalmic pharmaceutical products in North America, all of which are marketed under
the Harrow name. We also own and operate ImprimisRx, one of the nation s leading ophthalmology-focused pharmaceutical-compounding
businesses. 

Factors
Affecting Our Performance 

We
believe the primary factors affecting our performance are (1) our ability to increase revenues of our branded pharmaceutical products,
proprietary compounded formulations and certain non-proprietary products, and grow and gain operating efficiencies in our operations,
(2) potential and ongoing regulatory-related restrictions, (3) our ability to optimize pricing and obtain reimbursement options for our
drug products, and continue to pursue development and commercialization opportunities for certain of our ophthalmology and other assets
that we have not yet made commercially available. We believe we have built a tangible and intangible infrastructure that will allow us
to scale revenues efficiently in the near and long-term. All of these activities will require significant costs and other resources,
which we may not have or be able to obtain from operations or other sources. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below.

Developments 

The
following is a summary of selected significant developments affecting our business that occurred since December 31, 2023. For additional
developments, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Cybersecurity Incident 

In November 2024, we became aware of a cybersecurity incident that involved unauthorized access of an employee s
email account. Through this unauthorized access the threat actor was able to fraudulently divert Company funds to its bank account. We
detected the incident in a time that management believes minimized any financial, operational or reputational risk to the Company, we
believe this early detection will result in an immaterial impact to the Company s financial results and at no point was our ability
to generate revenues disrupted. We, along with our external cybersecurity experts, are continuing to work diligently to fully investigate
and assess the impact of the incident and we have notified, and are cooperating with, federal law enforcement. As the investigation of
the incident is ongoing, the full scope, nature and impact of the incident are not yet fully known. 

TRIESENCE
Re-Launch, Oaktree Second Amendment and Draw 

In
October 2024, we announced the re-launch of TRIESENCE following the successful manufacturing of three process performance
qualification batches of the product. In connection with the re-launch, during October 2024 we made a one-time payment of
 37,000,000 to Novartis Technology, LLC and Novartis Innovative Therapies AG (together, Novartis pursuant to terms of
an asset purchase agreement between Novartis and the Company. Also, during October 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment (the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement and Guaranty originally entered into
on March 27, 2023, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Credit Agreement and Guaranty and Consent, dated as of July 18,
2023 (as amended, the Oaktree Loan ), with the lenders from time to time party thereto and Oaktree Fund Administration,
LLC, as administrative agent for the lenders Oaktree ). Upon satisfaction of certain conditions to funding,
the Company drew down the principal amount of 30,000,000 (the 30,000,000 Draw under a pre-existing commitment under
the Oaktree Loan to partially fund the one-time payment to Novartis. 

In
the Second Amendment, the Company and Oaktree agreed to certain changes to the Oaktree Loan in connection with the Company s draw
under the Oaktree Loan. Pursuant to the amendment, Oaktree agreed to waive any make-whole costs associated with the 30,000,000 Draw
in the event of early repayment of the debt under the Oaktree Loan if paid before March 31, 2025. In addition, Oaktree agreed to exclude
the 30,000,000 Draw from the calculation of the Total Leverage Ratio as defined in the Oaktree Loan. No other material changes to the
Oaktree Loan were provided in the Second Amendment. 

Following
entry into the Second Amendment and the funding of the Novartis milestone payment, the Company has drawn down a total principal loan
amount of 107,500,000 under the Oaktree Loan and no additional principal loan amount remains available to the Company under the Oaktree
Loan. 

Apotex - Canadian Out-License 

In

ophthalmic solution) 0.24 (with VERKAZIA and Cationorm Plus, collectively, the Apotex Products ). In exchange for these
licenses, Harrow will earn amounts related to manufacturing, regulatory and commercial achievement milestones, in addition to royalties
on net sales of the Apotex Products. 

IHEEZO
Reimbursement 

In
January 2024, we met with the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS to request clarification related to its
anesthesia billing policy which has historically not allowed for the separate billing of anesthesia services in the physician s
office. During the meeting we requested that CMS clarify that J-Code 2403, IHEEZO s permanent J-Code, is appropriate to be billed
for the anesthesia product itself (i.e., IHEEZO in our case) in the physician office setting. In March 2024, we received communication
from a representative at CMS that the inclusion of J-Code 2403 in CMS s April 2024 quarterly drug pricing file of the average sales
prices (ASP) of some Medicare Part B-covered drugs and biologicals confirms that IHEEZO is separately payable in the physician office
setting. 

In
February 2024, we made a request to CMS to consider increasing the Medically Unlikely Edits MUE for IHEEZO s J-Code
from 1 to 2. This request was made because the limitation of one MUE only allowed a single IHEEZO administration (equal to one single-use
vial) to be used and billed, while many ophthalmologists perform bilateral ocular procedures, which would require two vials of IHEEZO
to be used. On March 20, 2024, we received communication from the National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) program of CMS stating that
CMS decided to increase the MUE for IHEEZO s J-Code (J2403) from 1 to 2. The MUE edit was made effective on July 1, 2024.

VEVYE
U.S. Launch 

In
January 2024, we launched VEVYE (cyclosporine ophthalmic solution) 0.1 , the first and only water-free cyclosporine dissolved in a semifluorinated
alkane approved to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in the U.S. We partnered with various entities including PhilRx,
Apollo Care and PARx Solutions to enhance our market and patient access program for VEVYE.

regulatory enhancements, costs to support the transition of recent product acquisitions, and an increase in expenses related to the addition
of new employees in sales, marketing and other departments to support current and expected growth, including the commercial launch of
VEVYE in December 2023. Stock-based compensation expense increased by 1,227,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the prior year period.

Interest
Expense, Net 

Interest
expense, net was 5,525,000 and 16,411,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 5,749,000
and 16,200,000 for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The decrease during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
the same period in 2023 was primarily the result of increased interest income earned. The increase during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily the result from the increase in the outstanding principal amount of our debt
obligations. 

Investment
(Loss) Gain from Eton 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a loss of 3,171,000 related to the change in fair market value of Eton s
common stock at the time of its sale, including trading expenses and commissions of approximately 436,000, compared to a gain of 1,348,000
and gain of 2,676,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Loss
on Extinguishment of Debt 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 5,465,000, related to the early payoff of
a loan. 

Other
Income, Net 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded other income of 4,000 and 76,000, respectively, related to a sublease
of lab and office space in Nashville. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded other expense, net of 195,000
and 344,000, respectively, related primarily to transition services and write-off of inventories associated with the divestment of our
non-ophthalmology business. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 

Our
cash on hand at September 30, 2024 was 72,601,000, compared to 74,085,000 at December 31, 2023. 

In
October 2024, we made a one-time payment of 37,000,000 upon the achievement of a milestone associated with one of our asset
purchase agreements which was funded, in part, from our availability under the delayed draw commitments of our Oaktree debt
facility. 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to sustain our planned level of
operations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. In addition, we may consider the sale of certain assets including,
but not limited to, part of, or all of, our investments in Surface Ophthalmics, Inc. Surface and Melt Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. Melt and any of our consolidated subsidiaries. However, we may pursue acquisitions of revenue generating products
or drug candidates or other strategic transactions that involve large expenditures or we may experience growth more rapidly or on a larger
scale than we expect, any of which could result in the depletion of capital resources more rapidly than anticipated and could require
us to seek additional financing to support our operations. 

31 

We
expect to use our current cash position and funds generated from our operations and any financing to pursue our business plan, which
includes developing and commercializing drug candidates, compounded formulations and technologies, integrating and developing our operations,
pursuing potential future strategic transactions as opportunities arise, including potential acquisitions of additional drug products,
drug candidates, and/or assets or technologies, pharmacies, outsourcing facilities, drug company and manufacturers, and otherwise fund
our operations. We may also use our resources to conduct clinical trials or other studies in support of our formulations or any drug
candidate for which we pursue FDA approval, to pursue additional development programs or to explore other development opportunities.

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (4,423,000) compared to (4,856,000) during the
same period in the prior year. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities between the periods was mainly attributed
to changes in our working capital balances including accounts receivable, accounts payable, prepaid expenses and inventories. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by (used in) investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,396,000 compared to (152,350,000)
during the same period in the prior year. Cash used in investing activities in 2023 was primarily related to the acquisition of branded
products completed in 2023. Cash provided by investing activities in 2024 was primarily related to the sale of our investment in Eton. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash (used in) provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (1,457,000) and 126,546,000,
respectively. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to payment of payroll
taxes upon vesting of RSUs in exchange for shares withheld from employees. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to proceeds received from the sale of notes and common stock in our 2023 capital markets
transactions and entering into loan arrangements, offset by repayment of the B. Riley senior secured note and payment of payroll taxes
upon vesting and exercise of equity instruments in exchange for shares withheld from employees. 

Sources
of Capital 

Our
principal sources of cash have consisted of sales of our common stock, debt issuances, sales of our investments, and on an annual basis
(e.g. for the year ended December 31, 2023) cash generated from operating activities. We may also sell some or all of our ownership interests
in Surface, Melt or our other subsidiaries. 

32 

We
may acquire new products, product candidates and/or businesses and, as a result, we may need significant additional capital to support
our business plan and fund our proposed business operations. We may receive additional proceeds from the exercise of stock options that
are currently outstanding. We may also seek additional financing from a variety of sources, including other equity or debt financings,
funding from corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements, sales of assets or any other financing transaction. If we issue equity
or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and the newly
issued equity or debt securities may have more favorable terms or rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing
stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration or licensing arrangements or sales of assets, we may be required to
relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or proprietary technologies or formulations, or grant licenses on terms
that are not favorable to us. If we raise funds by incurring additional debt, we may be required to pay significant interest expenses
and our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization may increase. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming they would
be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments and may impose restrictions on our activities, such as the financial
and operating covenants. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing transactions, including
investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to
recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which would adversely
impact our financial results. 

We
may be unable to obtain financing when necessary as a result of, among other things, our performance, general economic conditions, conditions
in the pharmaceuticals and pharmacy industries, or our operating history, including our past bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, the
fact that we have a limited history of profitability could further impact the availability or cost to us of future financings. As a result,
sufficient funds may not be available when needed from any source or, if available, such funds may not be available on terms that are
acceptable to us. If we are unable to raise funds to satisfy our capital needs when needed, then we may need to forego pursuit of potentially
valuable development or acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan,
which would require us to modify our operations to reduce spending to a sustainable level by, among other things, delaying, scaling back
or eliminating some or all of our ongoing or planned investments in corporate infrastructure, business development, sales and marketing
and other activities, or we may be forced to discontinue our operations entirely.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
or submitted pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, our management conducted
an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange
Act, as they existed on September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to achieve their stated purpose as of September 30, 2024, the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information
contained in this Quarterly Report you should consider the risk factors below which have been updated based on recent events as well as
the other risk factors and information in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including our audited financial
statements and the related notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
If any such risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be
materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock would likely decline and you may lose
all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also
may impair our business operations. 

Our
business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity or other system failures. 

Despite
the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of any third parties with which we partner are vulnerable
to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures.
While we have not experienced any cybersecurity or system failure, accident or breach to date that has been determined to have had a material
impact, if a significant event were to occur, it could result in a material disruption of our operations, substantial costs to rectify
or correct the failure, if possible, and potentially violation of HIPAA and other privacy laws applicable to our operations. For example,
the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020 and gave California residents expanded
rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed
information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right
of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Although the CCPA includes exemptions for certain clinical trials
data, and HIPAA-protected health information, the law may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other
personal information we collect about California residents. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state privacy
legislation. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information,
such as the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR in the European Union (the EU that became effective
in May 2018 and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act that became effective in Canada in April 2000. We anticipate
that over time we may expand our business outside of the United States. With such expansion, we would be subject to increased governmental
regulation in the EU countries in which we might operate, including the GDPR. These laws and similar laws adopted in the future could
increase our potential liability, increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business. If any disruption or security breach
resulted in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or protected information, we could
incur liability, further development of our proprietary formulations could be delayed, and our pharmacy operations could be disrupted,
subject to restriction or forced to terminate their operations, any of which could severely harm our business and prospects. 

A breakdown
of our information technology systems, or a cyberattack or information security breach could significantly compromise the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation
of our business and/or affect our reputation. 

To
achieve our business objectives, we rely on sophisticated information technology systems, including hardware, software, technology infrastructure,
online sites and networks for both internal and external operations, mobile applications, cloud services and network-connected control
systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties. Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business, result in significant costs
and/or adversely affect our reputation. 

Our
information technology systems are highly integrated into our business, including our customer service infrastructure, R D efforts,
clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and product sales and distribution processes. Further, as the large part of our employees
work remotely for some portion of their jobs, our reliance on our third-party information technology systems has increased substantially
and is expected to continue to increase. Remote and hybrid working arrangements can increase cybersecurity risks due to the challenges
associated with managing remote computing assets and security vulnerabilities that are present in many non-corporate and home networks.
The complexity and interconnected nature of software, hardware and our systems make them vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions,
and to software errors or defects, misconfiguration and other security vulnerabilities. Upgrades or changes to our systems or the software
that we use have resulted and we expect, in the future, will result in the introduction of new cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks.
Our systems are also subject to frequent perimeter network reconnaissance and scanning, phishing and other cyberattacks. As the cyber-threat
landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication, and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect
and increasingly sophisticated in using techniques and tools including artificial intelligence that circumvent security controls,
evade detection and remove forensic evidence. Such attacks could include the use of harmful and virulent malware, including ransomware
or other denials of service, which can be deployed through various means, including the software supply chain, e-mail, malicious websites
and/or the use of social engineering/phishing. 

We
have experienced attacks against our network, although none that have had a material adverse impact to our business. Recently, in November
2024, we became aware of a cybersecurity incident that involved unauthorized access of an employee s email account. Through
this unauthorized access the threat actor was able to fraudulently divert Company funds to its bank account. We detected the incident
in a time that management believes minimized the financial, operational or reputational risk to the Company, and at no point was our ability
to generate revenues disrupted. However, we, along with our external cybersecurity experts, are continuing to work diligently to fully
investigate and assess the impact of the incident and have notified, and are cooperating with, federal law enforcement. As the investigation
of the incident is ongoing, the full scope, nature and impact of the incident are not yet fully known. 

34 

There
can be no assurance that our efforts to guard against the wide and growing variety of potential attack techniques will be successful.
Attacks such as those experienced by government entities (including those that approve and/or regulate our products) and other multi-national
companies, including some of our peers, could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access or protect important data, and
could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, including developing, gaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing,
selling and/or distributing our products. For example, in 2017, a pharmaceutical company experienced a cyberattack involving virulent
malware that significantly disrupted its operations, including its research and sales operations and the production of some of its medicines
and vaccines. As a result of the cyberattack, its orders and sales for certain products were negatively affected. In late 2020, SolarWinds
Corporation, a leading provider of software for monitoring and managing information technology infrastructure, disclosed that it had suffered
a cybersecurity incident whereby attackers had inserted malicious code into legitimate software updates for its products that were installed
by myriad private and government customers, enabling the attackers to access a backdoor to such systems. In 2022, Okta, Inc., a provider
of software that helps companies manage user authentication, disclosed that several hundred of its corporate customers were vulnerable
to a security breach that allowed attackers to access Okta s internal network. Although this breach did not have a significant effect
on our business, there can be no assurance that a similar future breach would not result in a material adverse effect on our business
or results of operations . 

Our
systems contain and use a high volume of sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets and other proprietary business
information, financial information, regulatory information, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials and/or personal
identifiable information belonging to us, our staff, our patients, customers and/or other parties. In some cases, we utilize third-party
service providers to collect, process, store, manage or transmit such data, which have increased our risk. Intentional or inadvertent
data privacy or security breaches (including cyberattacks) resulting from attacks or lapses by employees, service providers (including
providers of information technology-specific services), business partners, nation states (including groups associated with or supported
by foreign intelligence agencies), organized crime organizations, hacktivists or others, create risks that our sensitive
data may be exposed to unauthorized persons, our competitors or the public. System vulnerabilities and/or cybersecurity breaches experienced
by our third-party service providers constitute a substantial share of the information security risks to our business. There can be no
assurance that a cybersecurity incident would not result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Further,
the timeliness of our awareness of a cybersecurity incident affects our ability to respond to and work to mitigate the severity of such
events. 

Cyberattackers
are also increasingly exploiting vulnerabilities in commercially available software from shared or open-source code. We rely on third
party commercial software that have had and may have such vulnerabilities, but as use of open-source code is frequently not disclosed,
our ability to fully assess this risk to our systems is limited. There can be no assurances that a vulnerability in the software and services
that we use would not result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. 

Domestic
and global government regulators, our business partners, suppliers with whom we do business, companies that provide us or our partners
with business services and companies we have acquired or may acquire face similar risks. Security breaches of their systems or service
outages have adversely affected systems and could, in the future, affect our systems and security, leave us without access to important
systems, products, raw materials, components, services or information, or expose our confidential data or sensitive personal information.
An extended service outage affecting these or other vendors, particularly where such vendor is the single source from which we obtain
the services, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. For example, in February 2024, UnitedHealth
Group announced that a suspected nation-state associated cyber security threat actor had gained access to some of the Change Healthcare Change information technology systems. Change is the largest clearinghouse for medical claims in the U.S. While Harrow
was not directly impacted by this cybersecurity incident, it was reported that as a reaction to the cybersecurity incident, Change temporarily
disconnected over 100 related payment systems and Change was unable to process medical claims through its primary platforms. This resulted
in the delays to the revenue and cash collection cycle for several ASCs and physician offices, putting a strain on their cash resources.
While temporary, the cash constraints for these ASCs and physician offices, we believe, impacted sales of some of our products, such as
IHEEZO, during this disrupted period of time. In addition, we distribute our products in the United States primarily through three pharmaceutical
wholesalers, and a security breach that impairs the distribution operations of our wholesalers could significantly impair our ability
to deliver our products to healthcare providers and patients. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program
and processes, including our policies, controls, or procedures, will be effective in protecting our information technology systems and
sensitive data. 

We
will continue to experience varying degrees of cyberattacks and other incidents in the future. Even though we continue to invest in the
monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical and/or sensitive data and systems, there can be no assurances that our efforts will
detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks and/or breaches of our systems that
could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss or exposure of critical, proprietary, private, confidential
or otherwise sensitive data, which could result in material financial, legal business or reputational harm to us or negatively affect
our stock price. While we maintain cyber-liability insurance, our insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses that could
potentially result from a service interruption, breach of our systems or loss of our critical or sensitive data. 

We
are also subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection, including laws and regulations relating
to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. The legislative and regulatory environment
regarding privacy and data protection is continuously evolving and developing and the subject of significant attention globally. For example,
we are subject to the CCPA, which became effective in January 2020, which can result in substantial penalties for noncompliance. The CCPA
was amended in late 2020, to create the California Privacy Rights Act to create opt in requirements for the use of sensitive personal
data and the formation of a new dedicated agency for the enforcement of the law, the California Privacy Protection Agency. Similar consumer
privacy laws went into effect in Virginia, Colorado, Utah, Connecticut and Florida in 2023. Consumer privacy laws were also passed in
11 other states, with the earliest effective dates later this year, and proposed in three additional states. Failure to comply with these
current and future laws could result in significant penalties and reputational harm and could have a material adverse effect on our business
and results of operations.

of the then outstanding Applicable Commitments with respect to the Incremental Tranche A Term Loans or the Tranche B Term Loans; provided 
that the Borrower shall give the Lender and the Administrative Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice of

Borrower (by written notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified date of termination) if such condition is not
satisfied. The termination of the Incremental Tranche A Commitment or the Tranche B Commitment pursuant to this Section 3.04 shall

the extent that any payment by or on behalf of any Obligor is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate of the foregoing exercises its right of setoff pursuant to this Section 4.03 , and such

otherwise, then (i) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be
revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (ii) each
Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so

Agreement), the adoption of any Law, or any change in any Law, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
court or other Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Administrative
Agent or any of the Lenders (or its lending office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any
such Governmental Authority, shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including any such requirement imposed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), special deposit, contribution, insurance assessment or similar requirement, in
each case that becomes effective after the date hereof (or, with respect to any Lender, such later date on which such Lender becomes
a party to this Agreement), against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, a Lender (or its lending
office) or shall impose on a Lender (or its lending office) any other condition affecting the Loans or the Commitment, and the
result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining the Loans, or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or subject any Lender to any Taxes on
its Loan, Commitment or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital (if any) attributable thereto by
an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender in good faith to be material (other than (i) Indemnified Taxes, (ii) Taxes described in clauses
(ii) through (iv) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (iii) Connection Income Taxes), then the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the certificate contemplated by Section 5.01(c) , such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction. 

Section

Requirements . If a Lender shall have determined
that, on or after the date hereof (or, with respect to any Lender, such later date on which such Lender becomes a party to this

administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, in each case that
becomes effective after the date hereof (or, with respect to any Lender, such later date on which such Lender becomes a party to
this Agreement), has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of a Lender (or its parent) as a consequence
of a Lender s obligations hereunder or the Loans to a level below that which a Lender (or its parent) could have achieved but
for such adoption, change, request or directive by an amount reasonably deemed by it to be material, then the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the certificate contemplated by Section 5.01(c) , such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender (or its parent) for such reduction. 

56 

Section
75. Notification by Lender .
Each Lender promptly will notify the Borrower of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof (or, with
respect to any Lender, such later date on which such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement), which will entitle such Lender to
compensation pursuant to this Section 5.01 . Before giving any such notice pursuant to this Section 5.01(c) such Lender
shall designate a different lending office if such designation (x) will, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, avoid the need
for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and (y) will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender. A certificate of such Lender claiming compensation under this Section 5.01 , setting forth the
additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder, shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest
error. The Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.01 
for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six (6) months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the
Borrower of the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s intention to claim
compensation therefor (except that, if the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives
thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for
International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States
or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to constitute a change in Law
for all purposes of this Section 5.01 , regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.

Section
78. Taxes . 

Section
79. Payments Free of Taxes .
Any and all payments by or on account of any Obligation shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as
required by any Law. If any Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the
deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be
entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by such
Obligor shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and
withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.03 the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal
to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 

57 

Section
80. Payment of Other Taxes by the
Borrower . The Borrower shall timely pay to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws, or at the option of the Administrative Agent, timely reimburse

Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 5.03 payable or paid by such
Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or
with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. 

Section
83. Indemnification by the
Lender . Each Lender shall severally indemnify
the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but
only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the
provisions of Section 14.05(e) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes
attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan
Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to
any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative
Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the
Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section
5.03(e) .

and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly
completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments
to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Law as reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two (2)
sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section
5.03(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B), and (ii)(D)) shall not be required if in such Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution
or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or
commercial position of such Lender. 

(ii)
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person: 

(A)
any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or about the date on which such Lender

behalf of each such direct and indirect partner. 

(C)
any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such

Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies
of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax,
duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and

were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of
the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law

Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it
shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability
to do so.

Section
86. Treatment of Certain Tax
Benefits . If any party to this Agreement
determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified pursuant to this Section 5 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5 ), it
shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section
5 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified
party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such
indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant
to this Section 5.03(g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the
event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 5.03(g) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying
party pursuant to this Section 5.03(g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net
after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such
refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to
such Tax had never been paid. This Section 5.03(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available
its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other
Person. 

Section

Section
88. If the Borrower is required to pay any
Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or to any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section
5.01 or Section 5.03 , then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use commercially reasonable efforts to
designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates if, in the sole reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or
assignment and delegation would (i) eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.01 or Section 5.03 , as
the case may be, in the future, (ii) not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment and delegation. 

Section
89. If any Lender requests compensation
pursuant to Section 5.01 , or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or
to any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.01 or Section 5.03 , and such Lender
has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 5.04(a) , or if any Lender is a
Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at such Lender s sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 14.05(b) (other than such Lender s consent)), all of its
interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 5.01 or Section 5.03 and
obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Transferee that shall assume such obligations (which
assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that: (i) the Borrower shall have provided all
of the documentation and information in accordance with Section 14.05(b) ; (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an
amount equal to (A) the outstanding principal of its Loans, (B) accrued interest thereon, (C) accrued fees and (D) all other amounts
payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and
accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting
from a claim for compensation under Section 5.01 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 5.03 , such
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and (iv) such assignment does not conflict with
applicable Law. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver
by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to
apply.

90. Inability to Determine
Rates . 

Section
91. Replacement of Term SOFR or Successor

in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive
absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Majority Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Majority
Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Majority Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that: 

Section
92. adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining Term SOFR pursuant to the definition thereof, including because the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or
published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or 

Section
93. CME or any successor administrator of
the Term SOFR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator with
respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such capacity has made a public statement identifying a specific
date after which three month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be representative or
made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of U.S. dollar denominated syndicated loans or shall or
will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide such interest periods of Term SOFR after such specific date,
(the latest date on which such interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer representative or available
permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date );

until the expiration of the tenth (10 th Business Day subsequent to the date the financial statements are required to be
delivered for such fiscal quarter pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or 8.01(b) (the Cure Expiration
Date ), the Borrower shall have the right to make a Net Revenues Cure Payment; provided that such payment shall
be made with either cash on hand (subject to pro forma compliance with Section 10.01 or cash raised from the issuance or
sale of Qualified Equity Interests in the Borrower for cash (the Minimum Net Revenues Cure Right ). Upon
the Administrative Agent s receipt of the applicable Net Revenues Cure Payment or application of such cash amounts, the
Borrower shall then be in compliance with the requirements of the Minimum Net Revenues Covenant, and the Borrower shall be deemed to
have satisfied the requirements of the Minimum Net Revenues Covenant as of the relevant date of determination with the same effect
as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such date, and the applicable breach of the Minimum Net Revenues Covenant
and any related Default that had occurred shall be deemed cured for the purposes of this Agreement. Net Revenues shall be deemed
increased for the applicable fiscal quarter and any four fiscal quarter period that contains such fiscal quarter, solely for the
purpose of measuring the covenant set forth in Section 10.02 and not for any other purpose under this Agreement, by an amount
equal to the Net Revenues Shortfall Amount (and the receipt by the Lenders of the Net Revenues Cure Payment pursuant to the Minimum
Net Revenues Cure Right and the related increase of Net Revenues by the Net Revenues Shortfall Amount shall be deemed to have no
other effect whatsoever under this Agreement other than as specifically provided in this Section 11.04 ). Any Net Revenues
Cure Payment shall be applied to the prepayment of all outstanding Obligations, which shall include the Yield Protection Premium, if
applicable, any accrued and unpaid interest and Commitment Fee, and the Exit Fee. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement,
the Borrower may not exercise a Minimum Net Revenues Cure Right more than four times over the life of the loan or more than two
times in any twelve month period. 

Section
424. Upon the Administrative Agent s receipt
of a notice from the Borrower that it intends to exercise the Minimum Net Revenues Cure Right (a Notice of Intent to Cure
Net Revenues Covenant ), until the Cure Expiration Date to which such Notice of Intent to Cure Net Revenues
Covenant relates, no Lender shall be required to extend any credit pursuant to its Commitment during such period. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor any Lender shall exercise the right to accelerate the Loans or terminate the Commitments and none of the Administrative Agent
or any Lender shall exercise any right to foreclose on or take possession of the Collateral or exercise any other remedy pursuant to
 Section 11.02 or Section 11.03 , the other Loan Documents or applicable law prior to the Cure Expiration Date solely on
the basis of an Event of Default having occurred and continuing under Section 10.02 (except to the extent that the Borrower has
confirmed in writing that it does not intend to exercise a Minimum Net Revenues Cure Right). If on or prior to the Cure Expiration Date,
the Oaktree Lender declines the exercise by the Borrower of the Minimum Net Revenues Cure Right by written notice to the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower to that effect, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the Minimum Net Revenues
Covenant as of the relevant date of determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such
date, and the applicable breach of the Minimum Net Revenues Covenant and any related default that had occurred shall be deemed cured
for the purposes of this Agreement. 

113 

Section
425. Payment of Yield Protection
Premium and Exit Fee . Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Yield Protection Premium and the Exit Fee shall automatically be due and payable at
any time the Obligations become due and payable prior to the Maturity Date in accordance with the terms hereof as though such
Indebtedness was voluntarily prepaid and shall constitute part of the Obligations, whether due to acceleration pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement (in which case it shall be due immediately, upon the giving of notice to Borrower in accordance with Section
11.02(a) , or automatically, in accordance with Section 11.02(b) ), by operation of law or otherwise (including, without
limitation, on account of any bankruptcy filing), in view of the impracticability and extreme difficulty of ascertaining the actual
amount of damages to the Lenders or profits lost by the Lenders as a result of such acceleration, and by mutual agreement of the
parties as to a reasonable estimation and calculation of the lost profits or damages of the Lenders as a result thereof. If the
Yield Protection Premium and/or Exit Fee become due and payable pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Yield Protection Premium and
Exit Fee, as applicable, shall be deemed to be principal of the Loans and interest shall accrue on the full principal amount of the
Loans (including the Yield Protection Premium and Exit Fee, as applicable) from and after the applicable triggering event. Any Yield
Protection Premium or Exit Fee (or, if required, both the Yield Protection Premium and the Exit Fee) payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall be presumed to be the liquidated damages sustained by each Lender as the result of the early termination,
acceleration or prepayment and each Obligor agrees that such Yield Protection Premium or Exit Fee is reasonable under the
circumstances currently existing. The Yield Protection Premium and Exit Fee shall also be payable in the event the Obligations
(and/or this Agreement) are satisfied or released by foreclosure (whether by power of judicial proceeding), deed in lieu of
foreclosure or by any other means or the Obligations are reinstated pursuant to Section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code. If the Yield
Protection Premium and/or becomes due and payable pursuant to this Agreement, such Yield Protection Premium and/or Exit Fee under
this Agreement and or in the event the Yield Protection Premium and/or Exit Fee is determined not to be due and payable by order of
any court of competent jurisdiction, including, without limitation, by operation of the Bankruptcy Code, despite such a triggering
event having occurred, such Yield Protection Premium and Exit Fee, as applicable, shall nonetheless constitute Obligations under
this Agreement for all purposes hereunder. Each Obligor hereby waives the provisions of
any present or future statute or law that prohibits or may prohibit the collection of the Yield Protection Premium or exit fee and
any defense to payment, whether such defense may be based in public policy, ambiguity, or otherwise . The Obligors,
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledge and agree that any Yield Protection Premium and the Exit Fee due and payable in
accordance with this Agreement shall not constitute unmatured interest, whether under Section 5.02(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code or
otherwise. Each Obligor further acknowledges and agrees, and waives any argument to the contrary, that payment of such amount does
not constitute a penalty or an otherwise unenforceable or invalid obligation. Each Obligor expressly agrees that (i) the Yield
Protection Premium and Exit Fee are each reasonable and each is the product of an arm s-length transaction between
sophisticated business people, ably represented by counsel, (ii) the Yield Protection Premium and Exit Fee shall be payable
notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at the time payment is made, (iii) there has been a course of conduct between the
Lenders and the Obligors giving specific consideration in this transaction for such agreement to pay the Yield Protection Premium
and Exit Fee, (iv) the Obligors shall be estopped hereafter from claiming differently than as agreed to in this Section
11.05 , (v) their agreement to pay the Yield Protection Premium and Exit Fee is a material inducement to the Lenders to make the
Loans, and (vi) the Yield Protection Premium and Exit Fee represent a good faith, reasonable estimate and calculation of the lost
profits, losses or other damages of the Lenders and that it would be impractical and extremely difficult to ascertain the actual
amount of damages to the Lenders or profits lost by the Lenders as a result of such event.

Secured Party thereunder shall not be limited by any concept of Proportionate Share or similar concept, (ii) each of the
Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be entitled to act at its sole discretion, without regard to the interest of such Secured
Party, regardless of whether any Obligation to such Secured Party thereafter remains outstanding, is deprived of the benefit of the

sell any Loans acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous
Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loan (or portion thereof),
and the Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender (and/or against any recipient that
receives funds on its respective behalf). For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments
of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, each party hereto
agrees that, except to the extent that the Administrative Agent has sold a Loan (or portion thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous

Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Obligor;
provided, that this Section 12.13 shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect

further, that for the avoidance of doubt, the last sentence of clause (d) above and this clause (e) shall not apply to the
extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds
received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or any other Obligor for the purpose of making such Erroneous

14.05(d) , and to receipt by the Administrative Agent of a processing and recordation fee in the amount of 3,500 provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in
the case of any assignment) from and after the date such Assignment and Assumption is recorded in the Register, the assignee
thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have
the rights and obligations of the Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and correspondingly the assigning Lender
shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the Lender s rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) and the other Loan Documents but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Section 5 and Section 14.03 . Any assignment or transfer by the Lender of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this Section 14.05(b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 14.05(e) . If an assignee is not a Lender,
the assignee shall provide the Administrative Agent with all know your customer documents requested by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to anti-money laundering rules and regulations. 

Section
503. Amendments to Loan
Documents . Each of the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders and the Obligors agrees to enter into such amendments to the Loan Documents, and such additional Security Documents and
other instruments and agreements, in each case in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders
and the Obligors, as shall reasonably be necessary to implement and give effect to any assignment made under this Section
14.05 . 

137 

Section
504. Register .
The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its
offices in the United States a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the
names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each
Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register ). The entries in the Register shall
be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name
is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. In addition, the
Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any
Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior written notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any assignment of any Loan
shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register. 

Section
505. Participations .
Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower, sell participations to any Eligible Transferee
(other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender or any Obligor or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
 Participant in all or a portion of the Lender s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of the Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender s
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Lender in connection therewith. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which any Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that would (i) increase
or extend the term of such Lender s Commitment (it being understood and agreed that a waiver of any condition precedent set
forth in Section 6.02 or of any Default or Event of Default or a mandatory reduction in Commitments is not considered an
increase of any Commitment), (ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal (excluding mandatory prepayments) of or
interest on the Loans or any portion of any fee hereunder payable to the Participant, (iii) reduce the amount of any such payment of
principal, or (iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon to a level below the rate at which the Participant is
entitled to receive such interest (other than a waiver of default interest). Subject to Section 14.05(f) , the Borrower agrees
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 5.01 or 5.03 (subject to the requirements and
limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 5.03(f) (it being understood that the documentation required
under Section 5.03(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 14.05(b) ; provided that such Participant (i) shall not be
entitled to such benefits unless such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with the documentation
requirements of Section 5.03(e)(ii) as if it were a Lender and complies with such requirements, (ii) agrees to be subject to
the provisions of Section 5.04 as if it were an assignee under Section 14.05(b) and (iii) shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Section 5.01 or 5.03 , with respect to any participation, than its participating
Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change
in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 4.03(a) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation
shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and
address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or
other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register ); provided that no Lender
shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or
any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan
Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other
obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the
contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no
responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 

138 

Section
506. Limitations on Rights of
Participants . A Participant shall not be
entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 5.01 or 5.03 than such Lender would have been entitled to
receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made
with the Borrower s prior written consent. 

Section
507. Certain Pledges .
Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under the Loan Documents to
secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided 
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or
assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 

Section
508. Certain Additional
Payments . In connection with any assignment of
rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to
the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the
Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment,
purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent
of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable Proportionate Share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the
Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full
all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest
accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full Proportionate Share of all Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under
applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a
Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 

139

obligations under the foregoing Sections) shall survive the repayment of the Obligations and the termination of the Commitments and,
in the case of the Lenders assignment of any interest in the Commitments or the Loans hereunder, shall survive, in the case
of any event or circumstance that occurred prior to the effective date of such assignment, the making of such assignment,
notwithstanding that the Lenders may cease to be Lenders hereunder. In addition, each representation and warranty
made, or deemed to be made by a Borrowing Notice, herein or pursuant hereto shall survive the making of such representation and
warranty.

enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent
and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New
York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions

increased (but not above the amount collectible at the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest

of any sum due to the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a
currency other than Dollars, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent

purchase Dollars with such other currency. If the amount of Dollars so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
Administrative Agent in Dollars, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation
and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent against such loss. If the amount of Dollars so
purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in Dollars, the Administrative Agent shall remit such excess to
the Borrower.
