 of total inventories, and the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, which approximates current cost, was used for all other inventories. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company changed the method used to determine the cost of inventory at certain U.S. businesses from LIFO to the FIFO method, as the Company believes the FIFO method is preferable because it provides a more consistent method for valuing inventory across the Company s operations, improves comparability with peers, and better reflects the current value of inventories at the balance sheet date. 
 
 The LIFO provision for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was million of expense and million of income, respectively, and was not material to the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Therefore, the Company recorded the pre-tax cumulative effect of this change in accounting method of million as a reduction of Cost of revenue in the first quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 8. Inventories for additional information regarding the Company s inventory balances.

 majority interest in its former Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier Rice, LLC ("CD R"). As a result of the transaction, the Company owned common units (the "Common Units") of Wilsonart International Holdings LLC ("Wilsonart") initially representing approximately (on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity and CD R owned cumulative convertible participating preferred units (the "Preferred Units") of Wilsonart representing approximately (on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity. The ownership interest in Wilsonart was reported using the equity method of accounting. The Company's proportionate share in the income (loss) of Wilsonart was reported in Other income (expense) in the Statement of Income. As the Company's investment in Wilsonart was structured as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, U.S. taxes were recorded separately from the equity investment. In 2016, the Company received a million dividend distribution from Wilsonart which exceeded the Company's equity investment balance and resulted in a million pre-tax gain in 2016. As a result of the dividend distribution, the equity investment balance in Wilsonart was reduced to and subsequent equity investment income was suspended and no longer recognized. 
 
 On August 5, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with affiliates of CD R for the sale of the Company s noncontrolling equity interest in Wilsonart for million. The transaction closed immediately after the execution of the purchase agreement. Proceeds from the transaction, net of transaction costs, were million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of million which was included in Other income (expense) in the Statement of Income. Income taxes on the gain were more than offset by a discrete tax benefit of million in the third quarter of 2024 related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards upon the sale of Wilsonart. Refer to Note 6. Income Taxes for further information. The sale of the Company s equity interest in Wilsonart is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial results in subsequent quarters.

The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from discrete income tax benefits in the third quarter of 2024 of million related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards upon the sale of Wilsonart and million related to a reorganization of the Company's intellectual property, partially offset by a million discrete tax expense related to the remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits associated with various intercompany transactions. Refer to Note 4. Sale of Noncontrolling Interest in Wilsonart International Holdings LLC for more information regarding the Wilsonart transaction. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a discrete income tax benefit of million in the second quarter of 2023 related to amended 2021 U.S. taxes. The effective tax rates for 2024 and 2023 also included discrete income tax benefits related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions, including the Internal Revenue Service, His Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office, and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately million related predominantly to the potential resolution of income tax examinations. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.

ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

INTRODUCTION 
 
 Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company" or "ITW") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 84 divisions with approximately 45,000 people in 51 countries. 
 The Company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products. 
 
 Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Company's decentralized operating structure, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management. 

THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL 
 
 The powerful and highly differentiated ITW Business Model is the Company's core source of value creation. It is the Company's competitive advantage and defines how ITW creates value for its shareholders. The ITW Business Model is comprised of three unique elements: 
 
 ITW's 80/20 Front-to-Back process is the operating system that is applied in every ITW business. Initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, ITW has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the Company and its customers. Through the application of data driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, ITW focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the "80") and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the "20"). 80/20 enables ITW businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance; 
 
 Customer-back Innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at ITW. The Company's unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 Front-to-Back process. Working from the customer back, ITW businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their "80" customers. ITW's innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in "80" markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and creating unique solutions to address those needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 19,600 granted and pending patents; 
 
 ITW's Decentralized, Entrepreneurial Culture enables ITW businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. ITW colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the Company's strategy and values. As a result, the Company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services and solutions adapted to each business' customers and end markets. 
 
 ENTERPRISE STRATEGY: 2012-2023 
 
 In late 2012, ITW began its strategic framework transitioning the Company to fully leverage the unique and powerful set of capabilities and operating practices of the ITW Business Model. The Company undertook a complete review of its performance, focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations. ITW determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. 
 
 Key initiatives in the Company's enterprise strategy included portfolio management, business structure simplification, strategic sourcing and the diligent re-application of ITW's proprietary 80/20 Front-to-Back process. 
 
 As part of the Portfolio Management initiative, ITW exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all ITW businesses. This process 
 16 

included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated ITW divisions. 
 
 Business Structure Simplification was implemented to simplify and scale up ITW's operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. ITW now has 84 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation. 
 
 The Strategic Sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at ITW, delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year since 2013 and continues to be a key contributor to the Company's ongoing enterprise strategy. 
 
 With the initial portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely completed, the Company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth, reapplying the 80/20 Front-to-Back process to optimize its scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth. 
 
 Since implementing the Company's enterprise strategy in 2012, the Company has demonstrated the compelling performance potential of the ITW Business Model and superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the Company's operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. At the same time, these 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns. 
 
 OUR NEXT PHASE: 2024-2030 
 
 In the Next Phase of the Company s evolution, the ITW Business Model and the Enterprise Strategy framework will be as formidable of a competitive advantage and performance differentiator as it has been over the last decade, if not more so. Volatility, risk and the pace of change in the global operating environment will continue to increase, and a decentralized entrepreneurial culture allows the Company to be a fast adaptor to read, react, respond and evolve. The Company s ability to consistently execute and invest through the ups and downs of the business cycle is now a defining competitive advantage. 
 
 Throughout the Next Phase, the Company's focus is to build organic growth into a core ITW strength on par with the Company s world-class financial performance and operational capabilities. Throughout this phase, the Company will sustain its foundational strengths built over the past decade, including the high-quality ITW Business Model practice. Customer-back Innovation (CBI) is the most impactful driver to achieve high-quality organic growth through the cycle by establishing trusted problem solver relationships with key customers to effectively invent solutions that address customers' most critical pain points or tackle the biggest growth opportunities. CBI successes, coupled with underlying market growth and share gains, are how the Company intends to achieve its high-quality organic growth . 
 
 Portfolio Discipline 
 
 The Company only operates in industries where it can generate significant, long-term competitive advantage from the ITW Business Model. ITW businesses have the right "raw material" in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the ITW Business Model and have significant potential to drive above-market organic growth over the long-term. 
 
 The Company focuses on high-quality businesses, ensuring it operates in markets with positive long-term macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value ITW's differentiated products, services and solutions. ITW's portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the Company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments. 
 
 The Company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent long-term performance. This includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement ITW's long-term growth potential. 
 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest one business in the Specialty Products segment. This business was presented as held for sale beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022.

 On August 5, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with affiliates of Clayton, Dubilier Rice, LLC ("CD R") for the sale of the Company s noncontrolling equity interest in Wilsonart International Holdings LLC ("Wilsonart"). The transaction closed immediately after the execution of the purchase agreement. Proceeds from the transaction, net of transaction costs, were 395 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of 363 million which was included in Other income (expense) in the Statement of Income. Income taxes on the gain were more than offset by a discrete tax benefit of 107 million in the third quarter of 2024 related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards upon the sale of Wilsonart. The sale of the Company s equity interest in Wilsonart is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial results in subsequent quarters. Refer to Note 4. Sale of Noncontrolling Interest in Wilsonart International Holdings LLC and Note 6. Income Taxes in Item 1. Financial Statements for additional information regarding this transaction. 
 
 80/20 Front-to-Back Practice Excellence 
 
 ITW will continue to drive 80/20 Front-to-Back practice excellence in every division in the Company, every day. Driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 80/20 Front-to-Back practice across the Company, division by division, will produce further customer-facing performance improvement in a number of divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level. 

TERMS USED BY ITW 
 
 Management uses the following terms to describe the financial results of operations of the Company: 
 
 Organic business - acquired businesses that have been included in the Company's results of operations for more than 12 months on a constant currency basis. 
 Operating leverage - the estimated effect of the organic revenue volume changes on organic operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. 
 Price/cost - represents the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company's products versus changes in the selling price to the Company's customers. 
 Product line simplification (PLS) - focuses businesses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. In the short-term, PLS may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. In the long-term, PLS is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns. 
 
 Unless otherwise stated, the changes in financial results in the consolidated results of operations and the results of operations by segment represent the current year period versus the comparable period in the prior year. The following discussion of operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 During the first quarter of 2022, Russian military forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the United States and several other countries imposed economic and other sanctions on Russia. The Company has four immaterial Russian subsidiaries with total assets of approximately 26 million as of September 30, 2024. The revenue for these subsidiaries for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 6 million and 17 million, respectively. These subsidiaries are not material to the Company s results of operations or financial position. 
 
 18 

During the first quarter of 2024, the Company changed the method used to determine the cost of inventory at certain U.S. businesses from the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method to the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, as the Company believes the FIFO method is preferable because it provides a more consistent method for valuing inventory across the Company s operations, improves comparability with peers, and better reflects the current value of inventories at the balance sheet date. The LIFO provision for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 6 million of expense and 7 million of income, respectively, and was not material to the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Therefore, the Company recorded the pre-tax cumulative effect of this change in accounting method of 117 million as a reduction of Cost of revenue in the first quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8. Inventories in Item 1. Financial Statements for additional information regarding this change in accounting method and the Company s inventory balances. 
 
 In a challenging and dynamic environment, the Company delivered solid financial results in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2024 primarily due to the continued successful execution of enterprise initiatives and continued focus on the highly differentiated ITW Business Model.

 Cost of revenue was 2.2 billion and 2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of revenue was 3.8 lower in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower revenue. Cost of revenue as a percent of operating revenue improved in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to benefits from the Company's enterprise initiatives, partially offset by higher employee-related expenses. In the year-to-date period, cost of revenue was 6.6 billion and 7.0 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of revenue was 5.2 lower in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower revenue and the first quarter 2024 LIFO accounting method change, which reduced cost of revenue by 3.1 and 1.7 , respectively. Cost of revenue as a percent of operating revenue improved in the year-to-date period of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the LIFO accounting method change and benefits from the Company's enterprise initiatives, partially offset by higher employee-related expenses.

Selling, administrative, and research and development expenses as a percent of operating revenue were higher in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2024 compared to the respective 2023 periods, as higher employee-related expenses and the unfavorable impact of acquisitions in the first and second quarters of 2024 were partially offset by benefits from the Company's enterprise initiatives. 
 
 Amortization and impairment of intangible assets was lower in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to fully amortized intangible assets.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies in Item 1. Financial Statements. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 The Company's primary sources of liquidity are free cash flow and short-term credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 947 million of cash and equivalents on hand and no outstanding borrowings under its 3.0 billion revolving credit facility. The Company also has maintained strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include: 
 
 internal investments to support organic growth and sustain core businesses; 
 payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders; and 
 external investments in selective strategic acquisitions that support the Company's organic growth focus and an active share repurchase program. 
 
 The Company believes that, based on its operating revenue, operating margin, free cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing, if necessary. 
 
 29 

Cash Flow 
 
 The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. Summarized cash flow information for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2024 and 2023 was as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, In millions 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 891 982 2,167 2,500 Additions to plant and equipment (108) (126) (319) (324) Free cash flow 783 856 1,848 2,176 Cash dividends paid (415) (396) (1,252) (1,194) Repurchases of common stock (375) (375) (1,125) (1,125) Acquisition of businesses (excluding cash and equivalents) (115) Proceeds from sale of noncontrolling interest in Wilsonart International Holdings LLC 395 395 Net proceeds from (repayments of) debt with original maturities of three months or less (333) (25) (199) (367) Proceeds from debt with original maturities of more than three months 1,606 1,425 Repayments of debt with original maturities of more than three months (1,295) (678) Other, net 9 31 31 75 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents 21 (23) (12) (30) Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents 85 68 (118) 282

After-tax Return on Average Invested Capital 
 
 The Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("After-tax ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. After-tax ROIC is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). After-tax ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's ability to generate returns from cash invested in its operations and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate After-tax ROIC. The Company defines After-tax ROIC as operating income after taxes divided by average invested capital, which is annualized when presented in interim periods. Operating income after taxes is a non-GAAP measure consisting of net income before interest expense and other income (expense), on an after-tax basis, which are excluded as they do not represent returns generated by the Company's operations. For comparability, the Company also excluded the net discrete tax benefit of 121 million in the third quarter of 2024 from net income and the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, for comparability, the Company also excluded the discrete tax benefit of 20 million in the second quarter of 2023 from net income and the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. The most comparable GAAP measure to operating income after taxes is net income. Net income to average invested capital and After-tax ROIC for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

 In millions September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Increase/ (Decrease) Current assets: Cash and equivalents 947 1,065 (118) Trade receivables 3,226 3,123 103 Inventories 1,817 1,707 110 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 314 340 (26) Total current assets 6,304 6,235 69 Current liabilities: Short-term debt 1,768 1,825 (57) Accounts payable and accrued expenses 2,211 2,244 (33) Other 648 606 42 Total current liabilities 4,627 4,675 (48) Net working capital 1,677 1,560 117 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, a significant portion of the Company's cash and equivalents was held by international subsidiaries. Cash and equivalents held internationally may be subject to foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash and equivalents held internationally are typically used for international operating needs or reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses. International funds may also be used to fund international acquisitions or, if not considered permanently invested, may be repatriated to the U.S. The Company has accrued for foreign withholding taxes related to foreign held cash and equivalents that are not permanently invested. 
 
 In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from operations to fund domestic cash needs and the Company's capital allocation priorities. This includes operating needs of the U.S. businesses, dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations, reinvesting to fund expansion of existing U.S. businesses and general corporate needs. The Company may also use its commercial paper program, which is supported by a long-term credit facility, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated by operations and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S. 

Debt 
 
 Total debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows: 
 
 In millions September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Short-term debt 1,768 1,825 Long-term debt 6,578 6,339 Total debt 8,346 8,164 
 
 Short-term debt included commercial paper of 265 million and 464 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 4.85 and 5.40 , respectively. Short-term debt also included 668 million as of September 30, 2024 and 661 million as of December 31, 2023 related to the 0.25 Euro notes due December 5, 2024, which were reclassified from Long-term debt to Short-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2023. Short-term debt as of September 30, 2024 also included 835 million related to the Euro-denominated credit agreement (the "Euro Credit Agreement") entered into on May 5, 2023, which was reclassified to Short-term debt in the second quarter of 2024 since the debt, including the options to extend the termination date, is due in April 2025. Additionally, Short-term debt as of December 31, 2023 included 700 million related to the 3.50 notes due March 1, 2024, which were repaid on the due date. 
 
 On May 5, 2023, the Company entered into a 1.3 billion Euro Credit Agreement with an initial termination date of May 3, 2024; provided, however, that the Company may extend the termination date by six months on up to two occasions. On May 
 34 

12, 2023, the Company borrowed 1.3 billion of Euro term loans under the Euro Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the borrowing were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding debt. Any loan under the Euro Credit Agreement may not be re-borrowed once repaid, in full or in part, and will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable EURIBOR (adjusted for any statutory reserves) plus 0.75 for the interest period selected by the Company of one, three or six months. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 1.3 billion outstanding under the Euro Credit Agreement, which was included in Long-term debt as the Company intended to exercise its options to extend the termination date. The first and second options to extend the termination date were both exercised in 2024. On May 22, 2024, the Company repaid 550 million of the term loans under the Euro Credit Agreement using a portion of the proceeds from the Euro notes issued on May 17, 2024, as discussed below. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 750 million remaining outstanding under the Euro Credit Agreement with an interest rate of 4.13 . 
 
 On May 17, 2024, the Company issued 650 million of 3.25 Euro notes due May 17, 2028 at 99.525 of face value and 850 million of 3.375 Euro notes due May 17, 2032 at 99.072 of face value. Proceeds from the issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of the indebtedness under the commercial paper program and the Euro Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Company also has a 3.0 billion revolving credit facility with a termination date of October 21, 2027, which is available to provide additional liquidity, including to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. No amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Total Debt to EBITDA 
 
 The Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA as a measure of its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by net income before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis. Total debt to EBITDA for the trailing twelve month periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows: 
 
 Dollars in millions September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Total debt 8,346 8,164 Net income 3,455 2,957 Add: Interest expense 285 266 Other (income) expense (430) (49) Income taxes 911 866 Depreciation 298 282 Amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
 101 113 EBITDA 4,620 4,435 Total debt to EBITDA ratio 1.8 1.8
