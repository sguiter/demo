. The Reverse Split became effective on July 3, 2023. As a result of the
Reverse Split, every six shares of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock were automatically converted into one share
of common stock, without any change in the par value per share or to the number of shares authorized and began trading on a post-Reverse
Split basis under the Company s existing trading symbol, BTCY, on July 3, 2023. No fractional shares were outstanding
following the Reverse Split. Any holder who would have received a fractional share of common stock was automatically entitled to receive
an additional fraction of a share of common stock to round up to the next whole share: shares were issued for this purpose on
July 19, 2023. Lastly, the Reverse Split does not impact the amount of authorized, issued or outstanding shares of preferred stock. 

All
issued and outstanding common stock, common stock per share amounts and corresponding balance sheet accounts contained in the
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this Reverse Split for all periods
presented. In addition, a proportionate adjustment was made to the per share exercise and conversion price and the number of shares
issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all outstanding stock options, warrants, convertible debt and equity instruments to
purchase shares of common stock. 

Going
Concern, Liquidity and Basis of Presentation 

The
accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a
going concern. The Company is in the early stages of commercializing its product ecosystem and is concurrently continuing in
development mode, operating a research and development program in order to develop, obtain regulatory clearance for, and
commercialize other proposed products. The Company has incurred recurring losses from operations, and as of September 30, 2024, had
an accumulated deficit of 
and a working capital deficiency of .
Those conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance
of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Management
anticipates the Company will continue on its revenue growth trajectory and improve its liquidity through continued business development
and after additional equity and debt capitalization of the Company. 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, the Company raised funds through short-term loans and promissory notes, net of repayments of 
from various lenders, and also raised funds through convertible notes, net of redemptions of from various lenders. 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, the Company raised funds through short-term loans and promissory notes, net of repayments of 
and convertible notes, net of redemptions of from various lenders. The Company sold common shares through use of its
registration statement, for gross proceeds of , raising a net amount of after paying a placement fee and other issuance
expenses. 

Additionally,
on September 19, 2023, the Company entered into a security purchase agreement with an institutional investor for the issuance and sale
of 
 shares of the Company s newly designated
Series B Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of 
 per share of Series B Preferred Stock (Note 9),
or gross proceeds of .
Net proceeds after issuance costs amounted to .
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, 
 Series B preferred shares were issued for net proceeds
of . 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2024, Series B preferred shares were issued for net proceeds of . The
Company also raised from the issuance of convertible notes to a lender. Lastly, the Company sold common shares through
use of its registration statement, for net proceeds of . 

As
we proceed with the commercialization of the Bioflux, Biocore, and Biocare product development, we expect to continue to devote significant
resources on capital expenditures, as well as research and development costs and operations, marketing and sales expenditures. 

Based
on the above facts and assumptions, we believe our existing cash, along with anticipated near-term financings, will be sufficient to
continue to meet our needs for the next twelve months from the filing date of this report. However, we will need to seek additional debt
or equity capital to respond to business opportunities and challenges, including our ongoing operating expenses, protecting our intellectual
property, developing or acquiring new lines of business and enhancing our operating infrastructure. The terms of our future financings
may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock. We may also seek additional funds through arrangements
with collaborators or other third parties. There can be no assurance we will be able to raise this additional capital on acceptable terms,
or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to modify our operating plan and otherwise
curtail or slow the pace of development and commercialization of our proposed product lines.

Both
the Bioflux mobile cardiac telemetry device, and the Biocore device are wearable devices. The cardiac data that the devices monitor and
collect is curated and analyzed by the Company s proprietary algorithms and then securely communicated to a remote monitoring facility
for electronic reporting and conveyance to the patient s prescribing physician or other certified cardiac medical professional.
Revenues earned are comprised of device sales revenues and technology fee revenues (technology as a service). The devices, together with
their licensed software, are available for sale to the medical center or physician, who is responsible for the delivery of clinical diagnosis
and therapy. The remote monitoring, data collection and reporting services performed by the technology culminate in a patient study that
is generally billable when it is complete and is issued to the physician. In order to recognize revenue, management considers whether
or not the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a commercial arrangement exists, and delivery has occurred or services
have been rendered. For sales of devices, which are invoiced directly, additional revenue recognition criteria include that the price
is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured; for device sales contracts with terms of more than one year, the
Company recognizes any significant financing component as revenue over the contractual period using the effective interest method, and
the associated interest income is reflected accordingly on the statement of operations and included in other income; for revenue that
is earned based on customer usage of the proprietary software to render a patient s cardiac study, the Company recognizes revenue
when the study ends based on a fixed billing rate. Costs associated with providing the services are recorded as the service is provided
regardless of whether or when revenue is recognized. 

The
Company may also earn service-related revenue from contracts with other counterparties with which it consults. This contract work is
separate and distinct from services provided to clinical customers, but may be with a reseller or other counterparties that are working
to establish their operations in foreign jurisdictions or ancillary products or market segments in which the Company has expertise and
may eventually conduct business.

Provisions 

Provisions are
 recognized when the Company has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a previous event, if it is probable that
 the Company will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation. The amount recognized
 is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account
 the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligations. Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to
 reflect the current best estimate of the expected future cash flows. 

Contingencies 

Contingencies can be either
 possible assets or possible liabilities arising from past events, which, by their nature, will be resolved only when one or more uncertain
 future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence and potential impact of contingencies inherently involves the
 exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. 

Inventory
 obsolescence 

Inventories are
 stated at the lower of cost and market value. Market value of our inventory, which is all purchased finished goods, is determined based
 on its estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price less normally predictable costs of disposal and transportation.
 The Company estimates net realizable value as the amount at which inventories are expected to be sold, taking into consideration fluctuations
 in retail prices less estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Inventories are written down to net realizable value when the cost
 of inventories is estimated to be unrecoverable due to obsolescence, damage, or declining selling prices. 

Income
 and other taxes 

The calculation
 of current and deferred income taxes requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise judgment regarding the
 carrying values of assets and liabilities which are subject to accounting estimates inherent in those balances, the interpretation
 of income tax legislation across various jurisdictions, expectations about future operating results, the timing of reversal of temporary
 differences and possible audits of income tax filings by the tax authorities. In addition, when the Company incurs losses for income
 tax purposes, it assesses the probability of taxable income being available in the future based on its budgeted forecasts. These forecasts
 are adjusted to take into account certain non-taxable income and expenses and specific rules on the use of unused credits and tax losses. 

When the
 forecasts indicate that sufficient future taxable income will be available to deduct the temporary differences, a deferred tax asset
 is recognized for all deductible temporary differences. Changes or differences in underlying estimates or assumptions may result in
 changes to the current or deferred income tax balances on the consolidated balance sheets, a charge or credit to income tax expense
 included as part of net income (loss) and may result in cash payments or receipts. Judgment includes consideration of the Company s
 future cash requirements in its tax jurisdictions. All income, capital and commodity tax filings are subject to audits and reassessments.
 Changes in interpretations or judgments may result in a change in the Company s income, capital, or commodity tax provisions
 in the future. The amount of such a change cannot be reasonably estimated. 

Incremental
 borrowing rate for lease 

The determination
 of the Company s lease obligation and right-of-use asset depends on certain assumptions, which include the selection of the discount
 rate. The discount rate is set by reference to the Company s incremental borrowing rate. Significant assumptions are required
 to be made when determining which borrowing rates to apply in this determination. Changes in the assumptions used may have a significant
 effect on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Company
Overview 

Biotricity
Inc. (the Company , Biotricity , we , us , our is a medical technology
company focused on biometric data monitoring solutions. Our aim is to deliver innovative, remote monitoring solutions to the medical,
healthcare, and consumer markets, with a focus on diagnostic and post-diagnostic solutions for lifestyle and chronic illnesses. We approach
the diagnostic side of remote patient monitoring by applying innovation within existing business models where reimbursement is established.
We believe this approach reduces the risk associated with traditional medical device development and accelerates the path to revenue.
In post-diagnostic markets, we intend to apply medical grade biometrics to enable consumers to self-manage, thereby driving patient compliance
and reducing healthcare costs. We intend to first focus on a segment of the diagnostic mobile cardiac telemetry market, otherwise known
as COM, while providing our chosen markets with the capability to also perform other cardiac studies. 

We
developed our Bioflux Bioflux COM technology, which has received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ), comprised of a monitoring device and software components, which we made available to the market under limited release
on April 6, 2018, to assess, establish and develop sales processes and market dynamics. Full market release of the Bioflux device for
commercialization occurred in April 2019. The fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 marked our first year of expanded commercialization efforts,
focused on sales growth and expansion. In 2021, we commenced the initial launch of Bioheart, a direct-to-consumer heart monitor that
offers the same continuous heart monitoring technology used by physicians. In addition to developing and receiving regulatory approval
or clearance of other technologies that enhance our ecosystem, in 2022, we announced the launch of our Biocore Cardiac Monitoring Device Biocore , previously branded as Biotres), a three-lead device for ECG and arrhythmia monitoring intended for lower risk
patients, a much broader addressable market segment. We have since expanded our sales efforts to 35 states, and intend to expand further
and compete in the broader US market using an insourcing business model. Our technology has a large potential total addressable market,
which can include hospitals, clinics and physicians offices, as well as other Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities IDTFs) .
We believe our technological and clinical advantage combined with our solution s insourcing model, which empowers physicians with
state-of-the-art technology and charges technology service fees for its use, has the benefit of a reduced operating overhead for us,
and enables a more efficient market penetration and distribution strategy. 

38 

We
are a technology company focused on earning utilization-based recurring technology fee revenue. The Company s ability to grow this
type of revenue is predicated on the size and quality of its sales force and their ability to penetrate the market and place devices
with clinically focused, repeat users of its cardiac study technology. The Company plans to grow its sales force in order to address
new markets and achieve sales penetration in the markets currently served. 

Full
market release of the Bioflux COM device for commercialization launched in April 2019, after receiving its second and final required
FDA clearance. To commence commercialization, we ordered device inventory from our FDA-approved manufacturer and hired a small, captive
sales force, with deep experience in cardiac technology sales; we expanded on our limited market release, which identified potential
anchor clients who could be early adopters of our technology. We then expanded our sales force and geographic footprint. 

In
2021, we received a 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our Bioflux Software II System, engineered to improve workflows and reduce estimated
review time from 5 minutes to 30 seconds. This improvement in review time reduces operational costs and allows us to continue to focus
on excellent customer service and industry-leading response times to physicians and their at-risk patients. Additionally, these advances
mean we can focus our resources on high-level operations and sales. 

During
2021 and the early part of 2022, we also commercially launched our Bioheart technology, which is a consumer technology whose development
was forged out of prior the development of the clinical technologies that are already part of our technology ecosystem, the Biosphere.
In recognition of our product development, in November 2022, Bioheart received recognition as one of TIME s Best Inventions of
2022. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of telemedicine and remote patient monitoring technologies. We continue to develop a
telemedicine platform, with capabilities of real-time streaming of medical devices. Telemedicine offers patients the ability to communicate
directly with their health care providers without the need of leaving their home. The introduction of a telemedicine solution is intended
to align with our technology platform and facilitate remote visits and remote prescriptions for cardiac diagnostics, but it will also
serve as a means of establishing referral and other synergies across the network of doctors and patients that use the technologies we
are building within the Biotricity ecosystem. We intend to continue to provide improved care to patients that may otherwise elect not
to go to medical facilities and continue to provide economic benefits and cost savings to healthcare service providers and payers that
reimburse. Our goal is to position ourselves as an all-in-one cardiac diagnostic and disease management solution. We continue to grow
our data set of billions of patient heartbeats, allowing us to further develop our predictive capabilities relative to atrial fibrillation
and arrythmias. 

In
January 2022, we received the 510(k) FDA clearance of our Biocore (previously named Biotres) patch solution, which is a novel product
in the field of Holter monitoring. This three-lead technology can provide connected Holter monitoring that is designed to produce more
accurate arrythmia detection than is typical of competing remote patient monitoring solutions. It is also foundational, since already
developed improvements to this technology will follow which are not known by us to be currently available in the market, for clinical
and consumer patch solution applications. In October 2023, we launched the cellular version of this device, the Biocore Pro. 

In
October 2022, we launched Biocare, after successfully piloting this technology in two facilities that provide cardiac care to more than
60,000 patients. This technology and other consumer technologies and applications such as the Biokit and Biocare have been developed
to allow us to transform and use our strong cardiac footprint to expand into remote chronic care management solutions that will be part
of the Biosphere. The technology puts actionable data into the hands of physicians to assist them in making effective treatment decisions
quickly. During March 2023, we launched our patient-facing Biocare app on Android and Apple app stores. This further allows us to expand
our footprint in providing full-cycle chronic care management solutions to our clinic and patient network. In January 2024, we appointed
Dr. Fareeha Siddiqui, a scientist and expert in community health and diagnostics, to the position of VP of Healthcare to spearhead the
roll-out and Biocare adoption to existing and new customers. 

We
are also developing several other ancillary technologies, which will require application for further FDA clearances, which we anticipate
applying for within the next twelve months. Among these are: 

advanced
 ECG algorithms and analysis software for further improvements in sensitivity and specificity to analyze and synthesize patient ECG
 monitoring data with the purpose of distilling it down to the important information that requires clinical intervention, while reducing
 the amount of human intervention necessary in the process; 

the
 Biocore 2.0, which is the next generation of our award winning Biocore 

We
identified the importance of recent developments in accelerating our path to profitability, including the launch of important new products
identified, which have a ready market through cross-selling to existing large customer clinics, and large new distribution partnerships
that allow us to sell into large hospital networks. 

Additionally,
in September 2022, we were awarded a NIH Grant from the National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute for AI-Enabled real-time monitoring,
and predictive analytics for stroke due to chronic kidney failure. This is a significant achievement that broadens our technology platform s
disease space demographic. The grant focuses on Bioflux-AI as an innovative system for real-time monitoring and prediction of stroke
episodes in chronic kidney disease patients. We received 238,703 under this award in March 2023, which we used to defray research and
development and other associated costs. 

39 

Our
mission is to innovate and create transformative healthcare products while ensuring financial discipline, to drive margin and revenue
growth to deliver value creation for our investors. Our commitment to innovation means that we harness data intelligently to explore
novel avenues for enhancing healthcare outcomes. Through cutting-edge research and development, we believe we are redefining medical
diagnostics and patient care and innovating new AI-driven solutions. 

As
a result of providing our Bioflux and Biocore products, Biotricity has monitored well over two billion heartbeats for atrial fibrillation
(afib), a leading cause of strokes. Over the past two years, these efforts have benefited over 28,000 patients diagnosed with afib, by
providing them with the prospect of earlier medical intervention which also produces significant healthcare savings to patients
and the healthcare system. 

We
are expanding our AI technology development in remote cardiac care, leveraging proprietary AI technology to provide a suite of predictive
monitoring tools to enhance new disease profiling, improve patient management, and revolutionize the healthcare industry for disease
prevention. 

We
have also strengthened relationships with Amazon and Google. The healthcare AI market opportunity is projected to grow to 208.2 billion
by 2030 according to Grand View Research. We have already established a strong foothold, having already built a powerful proprietary
cardiac AI model that combines Google s TensorFlow, AWS infrastructure, big data and a continuous learning engine. This combination
allows us to rapidly improve our cardiac technology. In the near future, we believe the capabilities of our cardiac AI model will allow
us to support healthcare professionals in handling exponentially more patients while identifying the most critical data. This will enable
healthcare workers to elevate the quality of care while serving a larger number of patients. As growing patient numbers further stress
the shortage of healthcare professionals, our technology could help alleviate this pressing issue. We have engineered our technology
to not only improve patient care and outcomes, but to do so in a manner that supports more patients. This has led to increasing sales
of our remote cardiac monitoring devices and the ramp-up of our subscription-based service, increasing our recurring revenue over the
past few quarters and charting a clear path to profitability. 

From
a market perspective, increasing interest and demand continue to drive the adoption of our suite of products, which are focused on chronic
cardiac disease prevention and management. Our efforts in commercialization and development have yielded tremendous progress in remote
monitoring solutions for diagnostic and post-diagnostic products.

operating metrics. Specifically, our recurring technology fees, device sales, and gross margins all demonstrated positive growth while
maintaining cost control through management s efforts to ensure cost reduction and expense management in order to make progress
on its plan to achieve positive cash flow and profitability. 

Revenue
and cost of revenue 

By
increasing our sales force and geographic footprint, we are actively selling in 35 U.S. states as of September 30, 2024. The Company
earned combined device sales and technology fee income of 6.5 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024 9.4 
growth in revenue over the 5.9 million earned in the prior year comparable quarter. 

Technology
fee revenue increased to 6.0 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, which is a 10.6 increase over the
corresponding six-month period of the prior year. The majority of this revenue is recurring, and its growth can be attributed to
strong customer retention that is supported by the quality of customer and cardiologist-friendly support services that emphasize
accuracy of diagnostics and ease-of-use. Device sales comprised 6 of our total revenue, or 388 thousand for the six-month period
ended September 30, 2024. Gross profit percentage was 74.6 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 66.2 in the
corresponding prior year quarter. This increase in gross margin is a result of improved margins on technology fee revenue as well as
significantly improved margin on device sales. Given consistent gross margin on technology fees of approximately 77.3 , and
efficiencies gained in using AI in data processing as well as an evolving revenue mix where technology fees are expected to comprise
an increasing proportion of revenue, we anticipate continued improvement in overall blended gross margin over time. Technology fees
comprised 94 of total revenue for the six-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

Operating

to the redemption and conversion of our convertible promissory notes. 

Other
income (expense) 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 36 thousand in net other income/expense, which consisted of loss on debt extinguishment,
income from late payment charges, as well as income attributed to the financing component provisions contained in our revenue contracts.
During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 143 thousand in net other expense attributed to non-operating costs
from note modifications, transaction expense on the Series B preferred share issuance, and the financing component provisions contained
in our revenue contracts. 

EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA 

Earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented below, are non-generally
accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial
information in evaluating operating profitability. EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
expenses to net income. 

Adjusted
EBITDA is calculated by excluding from EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of
unconsolidated businesses and other income and expenses that do not involve an outlay in cash, net, as well as the effect of special
items that related to one-time, non-recurring expenditures. We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and
other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends on the
Company s monthly and quarterly free cash flows, in a manner that is consistent with management s evaluation of business
performance. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and
trend analysis. See notes in the table below for additional information regarding special items. 

We
provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Biotricity s GAAP financial information, and it should be
considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that
providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information
to more fully and accurately assess business performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated
differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. 

Management
considers the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA measures for the three and six-month periods ended September 30, 2024, to be indicators of the
Company s progress towards breakeven profitability as well as improvement towards operating cash-flow break-even. EBITDA improved
by 80 and 50.4 , respectively, when compared to the three and six months ended for the corresponding prior period. Adjusted EBITDA, which management uses as a measure for tracking free cashflow levels, improved to negative 249
thousand for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a reduction of over 1.7 million dollars in negative Adjusted EBITDA from the comparative
period of the prior fiscal year, which is an 87 improvement. The Company was able to achieve a positive Adjusted EBITDA for the month
of September 2024 for the first time in its history.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Management
has noted the existence of substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, our independent registered
public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in the report on our financial statements as of and for the years ended March
31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, noting the existence of substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our existing
cash deposits may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses through at least twelve months from the date of this filing. To continue
to fund operations, we will need to secure additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings, through collaborations
or partnerships with other companies or other sources. We may not be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us, or at
all. Any failure to raise capital when needed could compromise our ability to execute our business plan. If we are unable to raise additional
funds, or if our anticipated operating results are not achieved, we believe planned expenditure may need to be reduced in order to extend
the time period that existing resources can fund our operations. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital, it may have a material
adverse effect on our operations and the development of our technology, or we may have to cease operations altogether. 

The
development and commercialization of our product offerings are subject to numerous uncertainties, and we could use our cash resources
sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of developing our products is costly, and the timing of progress can be subject to uncertainty;
our ability to successfully transition to profitability may be dependent upon achieving further regulatory approvals and achieving a
level of product sales adequate to support our cost structure. Though we are optimistic with respect to our revenue growth trajectory
and our cost control initiatives, we cannot be certain that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating
activities. 

The
Company is in commercialization mode, while continuing to pursue the development of its next generation COM product as well as new products. 

We
generally require cash to: 

purchase
 devices that will be placed in the field for pilot projects and to produce revenue, 

launch
 sales initiatives, 

fund
 our operations and working capital requirements, 

develop
 and execute our product development and market introduction plans, 

fund
 research and development efforts, and 

pay
 any expense obligations as they come due. 

The
Company is in the early stages of commercializing its products. It is concurrently in development mode, operating a research and development
program in order to develop an ecosystem of medical technologies, and, where required or deemed advisable, obtain regulatory approvals
for, and commercialize other proposed products. The Company launched its first commercial sales program as part of a limited market release,
during the year ended March 31, 2019, using an experienced professional in-house sales team. A full market release ensued during the
year ended March 31, 2020. Management anticipates the Company will continue on its revenue growth trajectory and improve its liquidity
through continued business development and after additional equity and debt capitalization of the Company. The Company has incurred recurring
losses from operations, and as at September 30, 2024, has an accumulated deficit of 136,101,106. On August 30, 2021 the Company completed
an underwritten public offering of its common stock that concurrently facilitated its listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. On September
30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of 17,424,814. On August 1, 2024, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating
that Nasdaq has determined to delist the Company s shares of common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market, effective at the open of
business on August 5, 2024. Nasdaq reached its decision pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) because the Company no longer complied
with the minimum 35 million market value of listed securities. Following the suspension of trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, the
Company s shares of common stock were again listed on the OTCQB under the symbol BTCY. 

46 

Adjusted EBITDA, which management uses as a measure
for tracking free cashflow levels, improved to negative 249 thousand for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a reduction of over 1.7
million in negative Adjusted EBITDA from the comparative period of the prior fiscal year, which is an 87 improvement. The Company was
able to achieve a positive Adjusted EBITDA for the month of September 2024 and expects further improvements in this measure in future
periods. 

On
September 30, 2024, we had cash deposits in the aggregate of 173,270. 

The
Company has developed and continues to pursue sources of funding that management believes will be sufficient to support the Company s
operating plan and alleviate any substantial doubt as to its ability to meet its obligations at least for a period of one year from the
date of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, the Company raised short-term loans and promissory notes, net of repayments of 1,476,121 from
various lenders, and also raised convertible notes, net of redemptions of 2,355,318 from various lenders. 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, the Company raised short-term loans and promissory notes, net of repayments of 853,030 and convertible
notes, net of redemptions of 2,962,386 from various lenders. The Company sold 36,897 common shares through use of its registration statement,
for gross proceeds of 123,347, raising a net amount of 119,285 after paying a 3 placement fee and other issuance expenses. 

Additionally,
on September 19, 2023, the Company entered into a security purchase agreement with an institutional investor for the issuance and sale
of 220 shares of the Company s newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of 9,091 per share of
Series B Preferred Stock (Note 9), or gross proceeds of 2,000,000. Net proceeds after issuance costs was 1,900,000. During
the three months ended March 31, 2024, 110 Series B preferred shares were issued for net proceeds of 925,000. 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2024, 220 Series B preferred shares were issued for net proceeds of 1,732,532. The
Company also raised 650,000 from the issuance of convertible notes to a lender. Lastly, the Company sold 97,811 common shares through
use of its registration statement, for net proceeds of 125,227. 

During period subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company raised additional
funding from private investors in the amount of 811 thousand in the form of promissory notes and convertible promissory notes. The Company
also raised additional term loan funding of 635,000 from its main term loan provider. 

As
we proceed with the commercialization of the Bioflux, Biocore, and Biocare product development, we expect to continue to devote significant
resources on capital expenditures, as well as research and development costs and operations, marketing and sales expenditures. 

Based
on the above facts and assumptions, we believe our existing cash, along with anticipated near-term financings, will be sufficient to
continue to meet our needs for the next twelve months from the filing date of this report. However, we will need to seek additional debt
or equity capital to respond to business opportunities and challenges, including our ongoing operating expenses, protecting our intellectual
property, developing or acquiring new lines of business and enhancing our operating infrastructure. The terms of our future financings
may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock. We may also seek additional funds through arrangements
with collaborators or other third parties. There can be no assurance we will be able to raise this additional capital on acceptable terms,
or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to modify our operating plan and otherwise
curtail or slow the pace of development and commercialization of our proposed product lines. 

The
following is a summary of cash flows for each of the periods set forth below.

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2024, we used cash in operating activities in the amount of 1.9 million. The cash in operating activities
was primarily due to selling expenses as well as research, product development, business development, marketing and general operations.
The decrease in cash used reflects management s concerted effort to contain costs while increasing revenues, on the path of achieving
break-even. 

47 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2023, we used cash in operating activities of 4.2 million. These activities involved expenditures
for sales, infrastructure and business development, as well as marketing and operating activities, and continued research and product
development. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was Nil during the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 1.3 million as compared to net cash provided of 4.8 million during the six months ended September
30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of Series B
preferred stock of 1.7 million. 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2023, the net cash provided by financing activities related primarily to net proceeds attributed to
the issuance of Series B preferred stock of 1.9 million, the issuance of convertible notes of 2.0 million
and the issuance of short term loans and promissory notes of approximately 0.8 million, net of repayments. Lastly, we
issued common stock resulting in 0.1 million of net proceeds. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and
judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported
amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonably
based upon information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent that there are material
differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial results will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect
our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating
our reported financial results are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations , included in our 2023 Form 10-K filed on June 27, 2024. 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates disclosed in Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2024 Form 10-K filed on June 27, 2024.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time communicated to the Company s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
based closely on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Rule 13a-15(e). The Company s disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching the Company s desired disclosure control
objectives. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Therefore,
even a system which is determined to be effective cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented.
Our systems of internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

At
the end of the period being reported upon, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the material information
required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and financial officer, as well as recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms relating to the Company. 

Changes
in Internal Controls 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three-month period ended September
30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
