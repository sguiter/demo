Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.

The Company owns 79.8 of PSSI with 20.2 acquired by several individuals and entities. The Company plans to continue the development of the technology. All sales and marketing activities are through PSSI. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may directly or indirectly impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations is highly uncertain and subject to change. We considered the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our estimates and assumptions and there was not a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended October 31, 2024. The Company s security products are licensed from CCS and developed by the company designed for personal and collateral protection. Products derived from this technology are intended to provide passive security scanning units for either walk-through or hand-held use to improve security for schools and other public facilities. Passive Portal units use electromagnets and do not emit anything (such as x-rays) through the subject. We have also completed a prototype with optional Digital Imaging, which will give the user of the scanner the ability to recall the entire traffic passing through the scanner at any time thereafter. As of May 19, 2020, the Company added an IR Camera for detection of elevated body temperatures and is presently offering these products: PASSIVE PORTAL Screens for Weapons only; PASSIVE PORTAL with EBT Screens for Weapons and elevated body temperature; EBT Station Screens for elevated body temperature only.

Although forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment, actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 15 Table of Contents Results of Operations During the three and six-months ending October 31, 2024, the Company did not receive any revenue. Our operating expenses for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 was 366,065 and 529,582 compared to 143,593 and 284,331 for the same periods in 2023. The increase was due primarily to higher consulting costs, which were 219,292 and 336,792 for the three and six months along with higher general and administrative costs of 146,773 and 192,790 for the three and six-months periods ending October 31, 2024 compared to general and administrative costs of 55,573 and 75,989 for the three- and six-month periods ended October 31, 2023.

These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility, and variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective loan agreements. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability will fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuation may be material. Total other income and expense for the three and six months periods ended October 31, 2024 was other income of 760,260 and 456,368 compared to other expense of 36,169 and 31,315 for the same periods in 2023.

We expect to raise additional funds from the sale of securities, stockholder loans and convertible debt. However, we may not be successful in our efforts to obtain financing to carry out our business plan. See the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have either implemented or that may have a material future impact on our financial position or results of operations.

We operate with a limited number of accounting and financial personnel. Although we retain the services of an experienced certified public accountant, we have been unable to implement proper segregation of duties over certain accounting and financial reporting processes, including timely and proper documentation of material transactions and agreements. We believe these control deficiencies represent material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Despite the material weaknesses in financial reporting noted above, we believe that our consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in all material respects. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 17 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
