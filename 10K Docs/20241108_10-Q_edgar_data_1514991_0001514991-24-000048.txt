 Liabilities Foreign currency derivatives 
 The Company's cash equivalents (comprised of money market mutual funds) are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. 
 The Company's foreign currency derivatives are classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy as their fair values are determined based on a market approach valuation technique that uses readily observable market parameters and the consideration of counterparty risk. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any material assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis that would be considered Level III. 
 Fair value measurements are also used in nonrecurring valuations performed in connection with acquisition accounting and impairment testing. These nonrecurring valuations primarily include the valuation of program rights, goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment. All of our nonrecurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under Level III of the fair value hierarchy.

Bus. Prof. Code 17200. The Plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages and restitution. On August 8, 2019, the judge in the Walking Dead Litigation ordered a trial to resolve certain issues of contract interpretation only. Following eight days of trial in February and March 2020, on July 22, 2020, the judge issued a Statement of Decision finding in the Company's favor on all matters of contract interpretation before the court in this first phase trial.

 On November 14, 2022, the Plaintiffs filed a separate complaint in California Superior Court (the MFN Litigation in connection with the Company s July 16, 2021 settlement agreement with Frank Darabont Darabont ), Ferenc, Inc., Darkwoods Productions, Inc., and Creative Artists Agency, LLC (the Darabont Parties ), which resolved litigations the Darabont Parties had brought in connection with Darabont's rendering services as a writer, director and producer of the television series entitled The Walking Dead and the agreement between the parties related thereto (the Darabont Settlement ). Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of contract, alleging that the Company breached the most favored nations MFN provisions of Plaintiffs contracts with the Company by failing to pay them additional contingent compensation as a result of the Darabont Settlement (the MFN Litigation ). Plaintiffs claim in the MFN Litigation that they are entitled to actual and compensatory damages in excess of million. The Plaintiffs also brought a cause of action to enjoin an arbitration the Company commenced in May 2022 concerning the same dispute. On December 15, 2022, the Company removed the MFN Litigation to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On January 13, 2023, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the MFN Litigation and informed the court that the Company had withdrawn the arbitration Plaintiffs sought to enjoin. On March 25, 2024, the Court issued a ruling denying the Company s motion to dismiss and the parties are currently conducting discovery. The trial for this matter, initially scheduled for September 17, 2024, has been rescheduled to October 27, 2025 . The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and will vigorously defend against them if they are not dismissed. At this time, no determination can be made as to the ultimate outcome of this litigation or the potential liability, if any, on the part of the Company. 
 The Company has been a party to actions and claims arising from alleged violations of the federal Video Privacy Protection Act (the VPPA and analogous state laws.

On October 27, 2023, the Company reached a settlement with multiple plaintiffs relating to their pending class actions alleging violations of the VPPA and analogous state laws with respect to the Company's subscription video services. On May 16, 2024, the class action settlement was approved by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Company has also reached settlements to resolve the arbitration claims.

 The Company is party to various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business, including the matters described above, as well as other lawsuits and claims relating to employment, intellectual property, and privacy and data protection matters. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and while the impact of these matters on the Company's results of operations in any particular subsequent reporting period could be material, management does not believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company or the ability of the Company to meet its financial obligations as they become due.

 operating segments: Domestic Operations and International. These operating segments represent strategic business units that are managed separately. 
 In 2024, the Company updated the name of its previously titled "International and Other" operating segment to "International" due to the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023, which was the sole component of the operating segment that comprised Other.

 In 2024, we updated the name of our previously titled "International and Other" operating segment to "International" due to the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023, which was the sole component of the operating segment that comprised Other. This update does not constitute a change in segment reporting, but rather an update in name only. Prior period segment information contained in this report includes the results of the 25/7 Media business through the date of divestiture. 
 Domestic Operations 
 In our Domestic Operations segment, we earn revenue principally from: (i) the distribution of our programming through our programming networks and streaming services, (ii) the sale of advertising, and (iii) the licensing of our original programming to distributors, including the distribution of programming of IFC Films. 
 Subscription revenue includes fees paid by distributors and consumers for our programming networks and streaming services. Subscription fees paid by distributors represent the largest component of distribution revenue. Substantially all of our subscription revenues for our programming networks are based on a per subscriber fee, commonly referred to as "affiliation agreements". The subscription revenues we earn vary from period to period, distributor to distributor and also vary among our programming services, but are generally based on the impact of renewals of affiliation agreements and upon the number of each distributor's subscribers who receive our programming, referred to as viewing subscribers. Subscription fees for our streaming services are typically based on a per subscriber fee and are generally paid by distributors and consumers on a monthly basis. 
 Under affiliation agreements with our distributors, we have the right to sell a specified amount of national advertising time on our programming networks. Our advertising revenues are more variable than subscription revenues because the majority of our advertising is sold on a short-term basis, not under long-term contracts. Our arrangements with advertisers provide for a set number of advertising units to air over a specific period of time at a negotiated price per unit. Additionally, in these advertising sales arrangements, our programming networks generally guarantee specified viewer ratings for their programming. Most of our advertising revenues vary based on the timing of our original programming series and the popularity of our programming as measured by Nielsen. 
 Content licensing revenue is earned from the licensing of original programming for digital, foreign and home video distribution and is recognized upon availability or distribution by the licensee, and, to a lesser extent, is earned through the distribution of AMC Studios produced series to third parties. Content licensing revenues vary based on the timing of availability of programming to distributors. 
 Programming expenses, included in technical and operating expenses, represent the largest expenses of the Domestic Operations segment and primarily consist of amortization of program rights, such as those for original programming, feature films and licensed series, as well as participation and residual costs. The other components of technical and operating expenses primarily include distribution and production related costs and program operating costs including cost of delivery, such as origination, transmission, uplinking and encryption. 
 The success of our business depends on original programming, both scripted and unscripted, across all of our programming services. These original series generally result in higher ratings for our networks and higher viewership on our streaming services. Among other things, higher audience ratings drive increased revenues through higher advertising revenues. The timing of exhibition and distribution of original programming varies from period to period, which results in greater variability in our revenues, earnings and cash flows from operating activities. There may be significant changes in the level of our technical and operating expenses due to the level of our content investment spend and the related amortization of content acquisition and/or original programming costs. Program rights that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated amortization pattern and, to a lesser extent, program rights that are 
 30 

predominantly monetized individually are amortized based on the individual-film-forecast-computation method. 
 Most original series require us to make significant up-front investments. Our programming efforts are not always commercially successful, which has in the past resulted and could in the future result in a write-off of program rights. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of program rights predominantly monetized individually, or a film group, is less than its unamortized cost, the Company will write off the excess to technical and operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Program rights with no future programming usefulness are substantively abandoned resulting in the write-off of remaining unamortized cost. 
 International 
 Our International segment consists of the operations of AMCNI, which earns revenue principally from the international distribution of programming and, to a lesser extent, the sale of advertising from our AMCNI programming networks. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, distribution revenues represented 66 of the revenues of the International segm ent. Distribution revenue primarily includes subscription fees paid by distributors to carry our programming networks. Our subscription revenues are generally based on either a per-subscriber fee or a fixed contractual annual fee, under multi-year affiliation agreements. Subscription revenues are derived from the distribution of our programming networks primarily in Europe, and to a lesser extent, Latin America. 
 Programming expenses and program operating costs are included in technical and operating expenses, and represent the largest expense of the International segment. Programming expenses primarily consist of amortization of acquired content, costs of dubbing and sub-titling of programs, and production costs. Program operating costs include costs such as origination, transmission, uplinking and encryption of our linear AMCNI channels as well as content hosting and delivery costs at our various on-line content distribution initiatives. Our programming efforts are not all commercially successful, which has in the past resulted and could in the future result in a write-off of program rights. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of program rights predominantly monetized individually, or a film group, is less than its unamortized cost, the Company will write off the excess to technical and operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Program rights with no future programming usefulness are substantively abandoned, resulting in the write-off of remaining unamortized cost. 
 Corporate / Inter-segment Eliminations 
 Corporate operations primarily consist of executive management and administrative support services, such as executive salaries and benefits costs, costs of maintaining corporate headquarters, facilities and common support functions. The segment financial information set forth below, including the discussion related to individual line items, does not reflect inter-segment eliminations unless specifically indicated. 
 Impact of Economic Conditions 
 Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on general economic conditions, including the impact of direct competition, our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. Additionally, changes in macroeconomic factors and circumstances, particularly high inflation and interest rates, and uncertainty regarding changes to inflation rates and interest rates, may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position or our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms favorable to us, or at all. 
 Capital and credit market disruptions, as well as other events such as pandemics or other health emergencies, inflation, international conflict and recession, have in the past caused and could in the future cause economic downturns, which have led and may lead to lower demand for our products, such as lower demand for television advertising and a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming services. Events such as these have in the past adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 The amounts presented and discussed below represent 100 of each operating segment's revenues, net and expenses. Where we have management control of an entity, we consolidate 100 of such entity in our condensed consolidated statements of income notwithstanding that a third-party owns an interest, which may be significant, in such entity. The noncontrolling owner's interest in the operating results of consolidated subsidiaries are reflected in net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our condensed consolidated statements of income.

 Revenues, net 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Subscription revenues de creased 4.9 in our Domestic Operations business due to a decline in affiliate revenues, partially offset by an increase in streaming revenues, and decreased 13.6 in our International business primarily due to the non-renewal of an AMCNI distribution agreement in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") in the fourth quarter of 2023. We expect linear subscriber declines to continue in our Domestic Operations business, consistent with the declines across the cable ecosystem. 
 32 

Content licensing and other revenues decreased 87.6 in our International business due to the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023. Content licensing and other revenues increased 31.0 in our Domestic Operations business primarily due to the delivery of 13 AMC branded shows in connection with our new content licensing agreement with Netflix. We expect content licensing revenues to vary for the remainder of 2024 and in 2025 based on the timing and availability of our programming to distributors. 
 Advertising revenues decreased 9.5 in our Domestic Operations business primarily due to linear ratings declines and continued softness in the advertising market, partially offset by digital and advanced advertising revenue growth. The decrease in our Domestic Operations business was partially offset by a 16.5 increase in our International business, primarily due to continued digital and advanced advertising growth in the U.K and increased ratings and growth across Central and Northern European advertising markets. We expect advertising revenue to continue to decline as the advertising market gravitates toward other distribution platforms. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Subscription revenues de creased 5.2 in our Domestic Operations business due to a decline in affiliate revenues, partially offset by an increase in streaming revenues, and decreased 12.4 in our International business primarily due to the non-renewal of an AMCNI distribution agreement in the U.K. in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Content licensing and other revenues decreased 14.9 in our Domestic Operations business due to the availability of deliveries in the period, and decreased 88.3 in our International business due to the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023. 
 Advertising revenues decreased 11.2 in our Domestic Operations business primarily due to linear ratings declines and continued softness in the advertising market, partially offset by digital and advanced advertising revenue growth. The decrease in our Domestic Operations business was partially offset by an increase of 40.1 in our International business, primarily due to the recognition of a one-time retroactive adjustment reported and paid by a third party for 13.4 million, digital and advanced advertising growth in the U.K. and increased ratings and growth across Central and Northern European advertising markets. 
 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 
 The components of technical and operating expenses primarily include the amortization of program rights, such as those for original programming, feature films and licensed series, and other direct programming costs, such as participation and residual costs, distribution and production related costs and program delivery costs, such as transmission, encryption, hosting, and formatting. 
 There may be significant changes in the level of our technical and operating expenses due to original programming costs and/or content acquisition costs. As competition for programming increases, costs for content acquisition and original programming are expected to increase. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased 7.7 in our Domestic Operations business primarily due to an increase in program rights amortization driven by the slate of AMC originals premiering over the last twelve months. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased 35.4 in our International business primarily due to the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased 4.7 in our Domestic Operations business primarily due to the impacts in 2023 associated with the delivery of the remaining episodes of Silo, an AMC Studios produced series, and the early termination of an output agreement that resulted in the acceleration of program rights amortization into 2023, partially offset by an increase in program rights amortization driven by the slate of AMC originals premiering over the last twelve months. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased 38.3 in our International business primarily due to the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 The components of selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs and costs of non-production facilities. 
 There have been and may continue to be significant changes in the level of our selling, general and administrative expenses due to the timing of promotions and marketing of original programming series. 
 33 

Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.1 in our Domestic Operations business primarily due to higher employee related costs, partially offset by lower levels of marketing expenses related to the third quarter 2024 content slate, and decreased 18.0 in our International business primarily due to the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.0 in our Domestic Operations business primarily due to higher marketing and subscriber acquisition expenses and decreased 6.7 in our International business primarily due to the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023. 
 Impairment and other charges 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 
 There were no impairment and other charges recorded during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we determined that the decline in our stock price was an indicator of potential impairment of goodwill. Accordingly, we performed quantitative assessments for all of our reporting units and concluded that the fair value of the AMCNI reporting unit declined to less than its carrying amount. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of 68.0 million , which is included in Impairment and other charges in the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 Additionally, during the second quarter of 2024, given continued market challenges and linear declines, we determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment of long-lived assets existed at BBCA, and concluded that the carrying amount of the BBCA asset group was not recoverable. The carrying value of the BBCA asset group exceeded its fair value, and accordingly an impairment charge of 29.2 million was recorded for identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets, which is included in Impairment and other charges in the condensed consolidated statements of income within our Domestic Operations business. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2023 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a 5.4 million other charge. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 During the second quarter of 2023, given the impact of market challenges at 25/7 Media, we revised our outlook for the 25/7 Media business resulting in lower expected future cash flows. As a result, we determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill existed at 25/7 Media and an impairment charge of 24.9 million was recorded. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a 5.4 million other charge. 
 Restructuring and other related charges 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring and other related charges of 3.5 million primarily consisted of severance and employee-related costs in our Domestic Operations business . 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring and other related charges of 6.4 million primarily consisted of severance and employee-related costs, as well as content impairments in connection with WE tv shifting to a reduced o riginals strategy, in our Domestic Operations business. 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Restructuring and other related charges were 10.6 million and 22.5 million for t he three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively, related to a restructuring plan (the "Plan") that commenced on November 28, 2022. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company substantially completed the Plan and exited a portion of its office space in its corporate headquarters in New York and all of its office space in Silver Spring, Maryland and Woodland Hills, California. In connection with exiting a portion of the New York office, the Company recorded impairment charges of 11.6 million, consisting of 9.1 million for operating lease right-of use assets and 2.5 million for leasehold improvements. The remaining costs consisted primarily of severance and other employee-related costs. 
 34 

Operating income 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues, net of 37.3 million, partially offset by a reduction in total operating expenses of 10.1 million. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues, net of 211.0 million and the 68.0 million goodwill impairment charge at AMCNI, partially offset by a decrease in technical and operating expenses of 93.5 million. 
 Interest expense 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average interest rates associated with the 10.25 Senior Secured Notes due 2029 refinancing the 4.75 Senior Notes due 2025, partially offset by the impact of a lower outstanding debt balance. Interest expense will continue to increase through the remainder of 2024, as compared to 2023, as a result of the refinancing and convertible note transactions described under Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average interest rates associated with the 10.25 Senior Secured Notes due 2029 refinancing the 4.75 Senior Notes due 2025, partially offset by the impact of a lower outstanding debt balance. 
 Interest income 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Interest income is primarily comprised of income generated from our money market mutual fund accounts and bank deposits. The decrease from the prior year can primarily be attributed to lower cash balances. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The increase from the prior year can primarily be attributed to interest received in connection with a one-time retroactive adjustment reported and paid by a third party. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we voluntarily prepaid 35.0 million of borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility, resulting in the recognition of a 0.4 million charge to write off a portion of the associated unamortized discount and deferred financing costs. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we voluntarily prepaid 35.0 million of borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility, resulting in the recognition of a 0.4 million charge to write off a portion of the associated unamortized discount and deferred financing costs. 
 In June 2024, we repurchased 15.0 million of our outstanding 4.25 Senior Notes due 2029 through open market repurchases, at a discount of 4.9 million, and retired the repurchased notes. We recorded a 4.7 million gain which reflects the discount, net of 0.2 million to write off a portion of the unamortized discount and deferred financing costs associated with the notes. 
 On April 22, 2024, we completed a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase any and all outstanding 4.75 Senior Notes due 2025 and redeemed all 4.75 Senior Notes due 2025 that remained outstanding after completion of the Offer at a price of 100.000 of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In connection with the Offer and redemption, we recorded a charge of 3.1 million to write off the remaining unamortized discount and deferred financing costs associated with the 4.75 Senior Notes due 2025. 
 35 

On April 9, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 ("Amendment No. 3") to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of July 28, 2017 (as amended to date and by Amendment No. 3, the "Credit Agreement"). In connection with Amendment No. 3, we made a 165.6 million partial prepayment of the Term Loan A facility under the Credit Agreement (the Term Loan A Facility ), bringing the total principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan A Facility to 425 million, and reduced the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility to 175 million. In connection with the partial prepayment of the Term Loan A Facility and reduction of the revolving loan commitments, we recorded a charge of 1.3 million to write off a portion of the unamortized discount and deferred financing costs associated with the Credit Agreement. 
 Miscellaneous, net 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The increase in miscellaneous, net was primarily related to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The decrease in miscellaneous, net was primarily related to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and costs incurred in connection with the refinancing transactions in the second quarter of 2024.

 Revenues, net 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Subscription revenues decreased due to a 13.5 decline in affiliate revenues, partially offset by a 6.6 increase in streaming revenues. Affiliate revenues decreased primarily due to basic subscriber declines. Streaming revenues increased due to year-over-year subscriber growth and price increases. Subscription revenues include revenues related to the Company's streaming services of 152.0 million and 142.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Aggregate paid subscribers 2 to our streaming services increased 5.4 to 11.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 11.1 million at September 30, 2023. 
 Content licensing and other revenues increased primarily due to the delivery of 13 AMC branded shows in connection with our new content licensing agreement with Netflix. 
 Advertising revenues decreased primarily due to linear ratings declines and continued softness in the advertising market, partially offset by digital and advanced advertising revenue growth. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Subscription revenues decreased due to a 13.3 decline in affiliate revenues, partially offset by a 6.3 increase in streaming revenues. Affiliate revenues decreased primarily due to basic subscriber declines. Streaming revenues increased due to year-over-year subscriber growth and price increases. Subscription revenues include revenues related to the Company's streaming services of 447.3 million and 420.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Content licensing and other revenues decreased due to the availability of deliveries in the period, including 56.1 million of revenue associated with the 2023 delivery of the remaining episodes of Silo, an AMC Studios produced series, and the impact of 20.3 million recognized in 2023 associated with the early termination of an output agreement that resulted in the acceleration of revenue into 2023. These decreases were partially offset by the delivery of 13 AMC branded shows in connection with our new content licensing agreement with Netflix in the third quarter of 2024, and the sale of our rights and interests to Killing Eve in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Advertising revenues decreased primarily due to linear ratings declines and continued softness in the advertising market, partially offset by digital and advanced advertising revenue growth. 
 
 2 A paid subscription is defined as a subscription to a direct-to-consumer service or a subscription received through distributor arrangements, in which we receive a fee for the distribution of our streaming services. 
 37 

Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased primarily due to an increase in program rights amortization driven by the slate of AMC originals premiering over the last twelve months. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased primarily due to the impacts in 2023 associated with the delivery of the remaining episodes of Silo, an AMC Studios produced series and the early termination of an output agreement that resulted in the acceleration of program rights amortization into 2023. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in program rights amortization driven by the slate of AMC originals premiering over the last twelve months. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher employee related costs, partially offset by lower levels of marketing expenses related to the third quarter 2024 content slate. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher marketing and subscriber acquisition expenses. 
 Segment adjusted operating income 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The decrease in segment adjusted operating income was primarily attributable to the revenue headwinds in our linear businesses.

 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased primarily due to the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023. 25/7 Media incurred 15.5 million of technical and operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The remaining decrease was primarily attributable to content cost savings associated with the non-renewal of an AMCNI distribution agreement in the U.K. in the fourth quarter of 2023.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023, as well as a decrease in corporate overhead costs allocated to AMCNI. 25/7 Media incurred 3.2 million of selling, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023, partially offset by increased selling expenses at AMCNI, including commissions. 25/7 Media incurred 11.6 million of selling, general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Segment adjusted operating income 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The increase in segment adjusted operating income was primarily due to an increase in advertising revenues and a decrease in AMCNI selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the impact of the non-renewal of an AMCNI distribution agreement in the U.K. and the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023. 25/7 Media generated 0.8 million of adjusted operating income during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The increase in segment adjusted operating income was primarily due to the recognition of a one-time retroactive adjustment reported and paid by a third party for 13.4 million, partially offset by the impact of the non-renewal of an AMCNI distribution agreement in the U.K. and the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023. 25/7 Media generated 3.5 million of adjusted operating income during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Revenues, net 
 Revenue eliminations are primarily related to Domestic Operations revenues recognized for licensing sales to the International segment. 
 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 
 Technical and operating expense eliminations are primarily related to AMCNI programming amortization for content acquired from the Domestic Operations segment. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Corporate overhead costs not allocated to the segments include such costs as executive salaries and benefits, costs of maintaining corporate headquarters, facilities and common support functions. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 increased primarily due to higher employee related costs, including additional compensation incurred in connection with an executive officer's separation agreement. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our operations typically generate positive net cash flow from operating activities. However, each of our programming businesses has substantial programming acquisition and production expenditure requirements. 
 Our primary source of cash typically includes cash flow from operations. Sources of cash also include amounts available under our Revolving Credit Facility and, subject to market conditions, access to capital and credit markets. Although we currently believe that amounts available under our Revolving Credit Facility will be available when and if needed, we can provide no assurance that access to such funds will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. The obligations of the financial institutions under our Revolving Credit Facility are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. As a public company, we may have access to capital and credit markets, although adverse conditions in the financial markets have in the past impacted, and are expected in the future to impact, access to those markets. 
 On April 9, 2024, AMC Networks entered into Amendment No. 3 ("Amendment No. 3") to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of July 28, 2017 (as amended to date and by Amendment No. 3, the Credit Agreement ), among AMC Networks and its subsidiary, AMC Network Entertainment LLC AMC Network Entertainment ), as the initial borrowers, certain of AMC Networks' subsidiaries, as restricted subsidiaries, Bank of America, N.A., as an L/C Issuer, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and an L/C Issuer. 
 In connection with Amendment No. 3, AMC Networks made a partial prepayment of the Term Loan A Facility, bringing the total principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan A Facility to 425 million, and reduced the Revolving Credit Facility to 175 million. In addition, pursuant to Amendment No. 3, the maturity date of 325 million principal amount of loans under the Term Loan A Facility as well as all of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility has been extended to April 9, 2028. The maturity date of the remaining 100 million principal amount of loans under the Term Loan A Facility continues to be February 8, 2026. Amendment No. 3 also includes certain other modifications to covenants and other provisions of the Credit Agreement. In addition, we also voluntarily prepaid 35.0 million of borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility during the third quarter of 2024. 
 40 

On April 9, 2024, AMC Networks issued 875 million aggregate principal amount of 10.25 Senior Secured Notes due January 15, 2029 (the Secured Notes ). AMC Networks received net proceeds of 863.0 million, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts. The Secured Notes are guaranteed by AMC Network Entertainment and AMC Networks' subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Agreement. 
 On April 22, 2024, AMC Networks completed a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase any and all outstanding 4.75 Senior Notes due 2025 and redeemed all 4.75 Senior Notes due 2025 that remained outstanding after completion of the Offer at a price of 100.000 of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 On June 21, 2024, AMC Networks Inc. completed a private unregistered offering of 143.8 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.25 Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the Convertible Notes ), which amount includes the full exercise of the initial purchasers option to purchase additional Convertible Notes. AMC Networks received net proceeds of 139.4 million, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts. The Convertible Notes are guaranteed by each of the Company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Company s credit facilities and the Company s 4.25 Senior Notes due 2029 and the Secured Notes, subject to certain exceptions, on a senior, unsecured basis. 
 In June 2024, the Company repurchased 15.0 million of its outstanding 4.25 Senior Notes due 2029 through open market repurchases, at a discount of 4.9 million, and retired the repurchased notes. 
 On November 1, 2024, the Company closed a transaction with BBC Studios in which it acquired the remaining 50.1 of the BBC America joint-venture that the Company had not previously owned for 42.0 million in cash. The Company now owns 100 of the BBC America business, with full operational control, and will continue to fully consolidate BBC America. 
 Assuming the transaction had closed on September 30, 2024, 132.9 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest related to BBC America, and reflected on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, would have been eliminated. Additionally, the Company s future contractual programming commitments to BBC Studios would have been significantly reduced. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, 28.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, previously held by foreign subsidiaries, was repatriated to the United States. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 816.4 million, as of September 30, 2024, included 142.9 million held by foreign subsidiaries. Of this amount, approximately 35.0 million is expected to be repatriated to the United States with the remaining amount continuing to be reinvested in foreign operations. Tax expense related to the repatriated amount, as well as the expected remaining repatriation amount, has been accrued and we do not expect to incur any significant, additional taxes related to the remaining balance. 
 We believe that a combination of cash-on-hand, cash generated from operating activities, availability under our Revolving Credit Facility and our accounts receivable monetization program, borrowings under additional financing facilities and proceeds from the issuance of the new debt, will provide sufficient liquidity to service the principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, along with our other funding and investment requirements over the next twelve months and over the longer term. However, we do not expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to repay the entirety of the outstanding balances of our debt at the applicable maturity dates. As a result, we will be dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets in order to repay, refinance, repurchase through privately negotiated transactions, open market repurchases, tender offers or otherwise or redeem the outstanding balances of our indebtedness. 
 The Company's Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase up to 1.5 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock (the "Stock Repurchase Program"). The Stock Repurchase Program has no pre-established termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any of its Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 135.3 million of authorization remaining for repurchase under the Stock Repurchase Program. 
 Failure to raise significant amounts of funding to repay our outstanding debt obligations at their respective maturity dates would adversely affect our business. In such a circumstance, we would need to take other actions including selling assets, seeking strategic investments from third parties or reducing other discretionary uses of cash. For information relating to our outstanding debt obligations, refer to Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Debt Financing Agreements" of our 2023 Form 10-K. In addition, economic or market disruptions could lead to lower demand for our services, such as loss of subscribers and lower levels of advertising. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility was not drawn upon at September 30, 2024. The total undrawn revolver commitment is available to be drawn for our general corporate purposes. 
 AMC Networks was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of September 30, 2024.

 As of September 30, 2024, our contractual obligations not reflected on the condensed consolidated balance sheet increased 180.8 million, as compared to December 31, 2023, to 1,054.4 million. The increase was primarily driven by the execution of new long-term third-party service contracts. 
 Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information 
 The following is a description of the terms and conditions of the guarantees with respect to the notes outstanding as of September 30, 2024 for which AMC Networks is the issuer.

The notes were issued by AMC Networks and are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by each of AMC Networks existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (each, a Guarantor Subsidiary, and collectively, the Guarantor Subsidiaries ). The obligations of each Guarantor Subsidiary under its note guarantee are limited as necessary to prevent such note guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. A guarantee of the notes by a Guarantor Subsidiary is subject to release in the following circumstances: (i) any sale or other disposition of all of the capital stock of a Guarantor Subsidiary to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) a restricted subsidiary, in compliance with the terms of the applicable indenture (ii) the designation of a restricted subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the applicable indenture or (iii) the release or discharge of the guarantee (including the guarantee under the AMC Networks credit agreement) which resulted in the creation of the note guarantee (provided that such Guarantor Subsidiary does not have any preferred stock outstanding at such time that is not held by AMC Networks or another Guarantor Subsidiary). 
 Foreign subsidiaries of AMC Networks do not and will not guarantee the notes.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes in our significant accounting policies since December 31, 2023. 
 We discuss our critical accounting estimates in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Internally, we use AOI and Free Cash Flow as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. 
 We evaluate segment performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is operating segment AOI. We define AOI, which is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), as operating income (loss) before share-based compensation expenses or benefit, depreciation and amortization, impairment and other charges (including gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses), restructuring and other related charges, cloud computing amortization and including the Company s proportionate share of adjusted operating income (loss) from majority-owned equity method investees. From time to time, we may exclude the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) from AOI that affect our operating performance. 
 We believe that AOI is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance on both an operating segment and consolidated basis. AOI and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in the industry. AOI should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for 
 44 

operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Since AOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. 
 The following is a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to AOI for the periods indicated:

 We define Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, all of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment, investment, and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. 
 The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow for the periods indicated:

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Fair Value of Debt 
 Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our fixed rate debt of 1.98 billion was more than its fair value of 1.74 billion by 236.5 million. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at September 30, 2024 would decrease the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by 10.5 million to 1.73 billion. 
 Managing our Interest Rate Risk 
 To manage interest rate risk, we enter into interest rate swap contracts from time to time to adjust the amount of total debt that is subject to variable interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes and we only enter into interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions that we believe are credit worthy counterparties. We monitor the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and to the extent possible diversify our swap contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not have any interest rate swap contracts outstanding. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.4 billion of debt outstanding (excluding finance leases), of which 373.8 million is outstanding under our loan facility and is subject to variable interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates prevailing at September 30, 2024 would increase our annual interest expense by 3.7 million. The interest rate paid on approximately 84 of our debt (excluding finance leases) as of September 30, 2024 is fixed.

Managing our Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries' respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as affiliation agreements, programming contracts, certain trade receivables and accounts payable (including intercompany amounts) that are denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional currency. Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company recognized gains of 8.5 million and 4.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and losses of 3.3 million and 0.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, related to foreign currency transactions. Such amounts are included in miscellaneous, net in the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 To manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, we enter into foreign currency contracts from time to time with financial institutions to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes. 
 We also are exposed to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a negative impact on our comprehensive income (loss) and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including our principal executive officer (our Chief Executive Officer) and our principal financial officer (our Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based upon that evaluation as of September 30, 2024, the Company's principal executive officer (our Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (our Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
