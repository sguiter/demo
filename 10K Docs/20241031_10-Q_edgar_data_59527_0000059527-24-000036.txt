Selling, General Administrative ("SG A") Expenses: SG A expenses decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same 2023 period, primarily due to reductions in employee costs partially offset by acquisitions.

Rationalization and Asset Impairment Charges: Rationalization and asset impairment charges increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same 2023 periods, primarily due to the rationalization plans initiated during the third quarter of 2024 and the disposal of the Company s Russian entity in the second quarter of 2024.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company s cash flow from operations can be cyclical. Operational cash flow is a key driver of liquidity, providing cash and access to capital markets. In assessing liquidity, the Company reviews working capital measurements to define areas for improvement. Management anticipates the Company will be able to satisfy cash requirements for its ongoing businesses for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter primarily with cash generated by operations, existing cash balances, borrowings under its existing credit facilities and raising debt in capital markets. The Company continues to expand globally and periodically looks at transactions that would involve significant investments. The Company can fund its global expansion plans with operational cash flow, but a significant acquisition may require access to capital markets, in particular, the long-term debt market, as well as the syndicated bank loan market. The Company s financing strategy is to fund itself at the lowest after-tax cost of funding. Where possible, the Company utilizes operational cash flows and raises capital in the most efficient market, usually the United States, and then lends funds to the specific subsidiary that requires funding. If additional acquisitions providing appropriate financial benefits become available, additional expenditures may be made. The following table reflects changes in key cash flow measures: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Cash provided by operating activities 503,182 545,880 (42,698) Cash used by investing activities (1) (335,357) (101,109) (234,248) Capital expenditures (85,117) (66,459) (18,658) Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (252,746) (32,685) (220,061) Cash used by financing activities (2) (152,298) (311,382) 159,084 Proceeds from (payments on) short-term borrowings 5,521 (74,818) 80,339 Proceeds from long-term borrowings 550,000 550,000 Payments on long-term borrowings (400,508) (7,997) (392,511) Purchase of shares for treasury (211,212) (130,589) (80,623) Cash dividends paid to shareholders (121,979) (111,277) (10,702) Increase in Cash and cash equivalents (3) 10,431 145,517 (135,086) (1) Cash used by investing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily for the acquisition of businesses in 2024. The Company currently anticipates capital expenditures of 90,000 to 110,000 in 2024. Anticipated capital expenditures include investments for capital maintenance and projects to increase efficiency, reduce costs, promote business growth or improve the overall safety and environmental conditions of the Company s facilities. (2) Cash used by financing activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the proceeds from the 2024 Notes issuances, partially offset by the repayment of the Term Loan as described in Note 10.

 Return on Invested Capital The Company reviews ROIC in assessing and evaluating the Company s underlying operating performance. As discussed in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section above, Adjusted ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company s financial performance. The calculation may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted ROIC is defined as rolling 12 months of Adjusted net income excluding tax-effected interest income and expense divided by invested capital. Invested capital is defined as total debt, which includes Short-term debt and Long-term debt, less current portions, plus Total equity. The following table presents the reconciliations of ROIC and Adjusted ROIC to net income: 

Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net income as reported 482,523 497,751 Plus: Interest expense (after-tax) 37,665 36,283 Less: Interest income (after-tax) 7,845 3,104 Net operating profit after taxes 512,343 530,930 Special items: Rationalization and asset impairment charges 29,390 13,001 Acquisition transaction costs 4,554 2,935 Pension settlement charges 4,811 Amortization of step up in value of acquired inventories 3,471 12,253 Loss (gain) on asset disposal 4,950 (1,646) Tax effect of Special items (2) (2,413) (5,159) Adjusted net operating profit after taxes 557,106 552,314 Invested Capital September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Short-term debt 111,993 7,700 Long-term debt, less current portion 1,150,616 1,102,858 Total debt 1,262,609 1,110,558 Total equity 1,339,190 1,225,582 Invested capital 2,601,799 2,336,140 Return on invested capital as reported 19.7 22.7 Adjusted return on invested capital (1) 21.4 23.6 (1) The decrease in Adjusted ROIC is primarily related to the increase in long-term debt as discussed in Note 10.

The new revolving credit facility matures on June 20, 2029. The new revolving credit facility will initially bear interest on outstanding borrowings at a per annum rate equal to secured overnight finance rate SOFR plus 1.10 and could fluctuate based on the Company s total net leverage ratio at a spread ranging from SOFR plus 1.10 to SOFR plus 1.60 . The financial covenants consist of a maximum net leverage ratio of 3.5x EBITDA and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5x EBITDA. The new revolving credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, as well as customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants for credit facilities of this type (subject to negotiated baskets and exceptions), including limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets and transactions with affiliates.
