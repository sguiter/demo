Student Loan Pools are typically 97 guaranteed by the United States government while SBA bonds are 100 backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. The majority of the Bank's MBS are issued or guaranteed by an agency of the United States government such as Ginnie Mae, or by Government Sponsored Entities ("GSEs"), including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Ginnie Mae MBS are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, while those issued by GSEs are not. 
 
 The amortized cost and fair value of AFS securities at September 30, 2024 , are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Since MBS are not due at a single maturity date, they are disclosed separately, rather than allocated over the maturity groupings below.

At September 30, 2024 our AFS investment portfolio consisted of individual AFS securities, of which were in an unrealized loss position. At December 31, 2023 , individual AFS securities were in an unrealized loss position. The Company reviews its investment securities portfolio at least quarterly and more frequently when economic conditions warrant, assessing whether an allowance for credit loss is deemed necessary. Management s evaluation of those securities as of September 30, 2024 is discussed below. 
 
 SBA Bonds - SBA securities are fully backed by the U.S. government. At September 30, 2024 , there were AFS SBA Bonds, of which had unrealized losses. These unrealized losses related principally to changes in market interest rates. The contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost bases of the investments. Because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company did not recognize the unrealized losses on these securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 MBS - At September 30, 2024 , approximately of the AFS MBS held by the Company were issued or guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. government such as Ginnie Mae, or by GSEs, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Ginnie Mae MBS are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, while those issued by GSEs are not. At September 30, 2024 , there were of these securities in an unrealized loss position. These unrealized losses are believed to be caused by the current interest rate environment. The contractual cash flows of those investments are guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. Government. Because the decline in market value is attributable to the current interest rate environment and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses on these securities were not recognized into income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Also included in AFS MBS are private label collateralized mortgage obligation ("CMO") securities, which are issued by non-governmental real estate mortgage investment conduits and are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. At September 30, 2024 , we held private label CMO securities with an amortized cost and fair value of million and million, respectively. At that date, of these securities had unrealized losses. Of the securities in a loss position, were rated AA or higher by Moody s, Bloomberg, and/or S P. In addition, each of the individual securities have credit enhancements further reducing potential realized losses. The unrealized losses on these securities are believed to be caused by the current interest rate environment. Because the decline in market value is attributable to the current interest rate environment and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses were not recognized into income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Municipal Bonds - At September 30, 2024 there were tax exempt municipal securities and taxable municipal securities that had unrealized losses. The Company believes the unrealized losses on these investments were caused by the interest rate environment and do not relate to the underlying credit quality of the issuers. Because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses were not recognized into income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Each of the municipal securities held was rated A2 (Moody s) or AA- (S P) or better. 
 
 Accrued interest receivable on AFS securities totaled million at September 30, 2024 and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses.

At September 30, 2024 , the amortized cost and fair value of HTM securities that were pledged as collateral for certain deposit accounts, FHLB advances and FRB and other borrowings were million and million, compared to an amortized cost and fair value of million and million at December 31, 2023 respectively. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , HTM securities had a combined book value of million and an average book yield of , which was calculated by multiplying the carrying value of each HTM security by its yield and dividing the sum by the total carrying value. The following table includes a summary of the amortized cost and average book yield of HTM securities by contractual maturity at September 30, 2024 . Since MBS do not have fixed maturity dates, they are disclosed separately.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , and individual HTM securities were in a loss position, including and securities that were in a loss position for greater than 12 months, respectively. The Company believes, based on industry analyst reports and credit ratings, that the deterioration in value was attributable to changes in market interest rates and was not in the credit quality of the issuer. The Company has the ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity. 
 
 The estimate of expected credit losses on HTM securities is primarily based on the ratings assigned to the securities by debt rating agencies and the average of the annual historical loss rates associated with those ratings. The Company then multiplies those loss rates, as adjusted for any modifications to reflect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts as considered necessary, by the remaining lives of each individual security to arrive at a lifetime expected loss amount. Additionally, private label CMO securities which are not explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government are evaluated utilizing underlying pool data such as historical loss rates, loan-to-value ratios and credit enhancement data. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , the Company held an amortized cost and fair value of million and million in HTM private label CMO securities, compared to an amortized cost and fair value of million and million at December 31, 2023 , respectively. All MBS issued by government-sponsored corporations are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. The state and local governments securities held by the Company are highly rated by major rating agencies. 

As a result of the analysis, the allowance for credit losses for HTM securities was not considered to be material as of 
 September 30, 2024 
 . The following table summarizes the amortized cost and credit ratings of our HTM securities that were considered to have greater than zero percent credit loss probability at

Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information regarding the borrowers' ability to pay off their loan in accordance with its terms. This information includes, but is not limited to, current financial and credit documentation, payment history, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. Risk ratings are used to rate the credit quality of loans for the purposes of determining the Bank s allowance for credit losses. The following definitions are used for credit quality risk ratings: 
 
 Pass - Loans that are performing and are deemed adequately protected by the net worth of the borrower or the underlying collateral value. These loans are considered to have the least amount of risk in terms of determining the allowance for credit losses. 
 Caution - Loans that do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification but possess weaknesses. 
 
 Special Mention - Loans that do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification but possess more weaknesses than Caution loans. 
 Substandard - Loans that are considered to have the most risk. These loans typically have an identified weakness or weaknesses and are inadequately protected by the net worth of the borrower or collateral value. All loans 90 days or more past due are automatically classified in this category. 
 Doubtful - Loans that have all the weaknesses of Substandard loans and those weaknesses make collection or liquidation highly questionable and improbable based on current conditions and values. 
 Loss - Loans that are considered uncollectible and of such little values that their continuance as assets is not warranted.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company did not have any loans that were 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Our strategy is to work with our borrowers to reach acceptable payment plans while protecting our interests in the existing collateral. In the event an acceptable arrangement cannot be reached, we may have to acquire these properties through foreclosure or other means and subsequently sell, develop, or liquidate them.

Allowance for Credit Losses and Collateral Dependent Loans 
 
 The Company has certain loans for which repayment is dependent upon the operation or sale of collateral, as the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The underlying collateral can vary based upon the type of loan. The following provides more detail about the types of collateral that secure collateral dependent loans: 
 
 Commercial real estate loans can be secured by either owner occupied commercial real estate or non-owner occupied investment commercial real estate. Typically, owner occupied commercial real estate loans are secured by office buildings, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and other commercial and industrial properties occupied by operating companies. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans are generally secured by office buildings and complexes, retail facilities, multifamily complexes, land under development, industrial properties, as well as other commercial or industrial real estate. 
 
 Construction real estate loans are typically secured by commercial and residential lots. 
 Commercial and agricultural business loans are primarily secured by business equipment, furniture and fixtures, inventory and receivables. 
 Residential real estate loans are typically secured by first mortgages, and in some cases could be secured by a second mortgage. 
 
 Home equity lines of credit are generally secured by second mortgages on residential real estate property. 
 
 Consumer loans are generally secured by automobiles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and other personal property. Some consumer loans are unsecured and have no underlying collateral.

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 
 The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. 
 
 Loan modifications made for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty typically have their impact already factored into the allowance for credit losses. This is due to the measurement methodologies used in estimating the allowance. Consequently, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies loans by providing principal forgiveness on certain of its real estate loans. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 In some cases, the Company will modify a certain loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. As such multiple types of modifications may have been made on the same loan within the current reporting period each much be reported. The combination is at least two of the following: a term extension, principal forgiveness, and interest rate reduction. Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. 
 
 The Company had two modified loans with a combined balance of at September 30, 2024 , compared to two modified loans with a combined balance of at December 31, 2023 . The Company did not modify any loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , there were loans modified with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which there was a payment default within 12 months of the restructuring date. The Company considers any loan 30 days or more past due to be in default. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - Unfunded Commitments 
 
 The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses - unfunded commitments for credit exposures such as unfunded balances for existing lines of credit and commitments to extend future credit, as well as both standby and commercial letters of credit when there is a contractual obligation to extend credit and when this extension of credit is not unconditionally cancellable (i.e., commitment cannot be canceled at any time). The allowance for credit losses - unfunded commitments is adjusted through the provision for (reversal of) credit losses. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur, which is based on a historical funding study derived from internal information, and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, which are the same loss rates that are used in computing the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses - unfunded commitments of and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, is separately classified on the balance sheet within "Other Liabilities."

million in outstanding borrowings under the Federal Reserve discount window and million under the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program BTFP with a weighted average borrowing rate of at September 30, 2024 compared to million in outstanding borrowings under the BTFP with a weighted average borrowing rate of at December 31, 2023 . During the first quarter of 2023, the Company elected to participate in the BTFP, allowing the Company to refinance its existing borrowings from the FRB discount window to receive a lower fixed rate. Advances made under the BTFP were for up to one year and were extended at the one year overnight index swap ("OIS") rate as of the day the advance is made plus basis points. The interest rate was fixed for the term of the advance on the day the advance was made. To determine the rate, the BTFP used the fixed OIS rate based on the effective federal funds rate for a one -year maturity. Effective January 24, 2024, the FRB announced that future advances under the BTFP through its expiration on March 11, 2024, would be no lower than the interest rate on reserve balances in effect on the date the advance is made. Depository institutions may borrow from the FRB discount window for periods as long as 90 days, and borrowings are prepayable and renewable by the borrower daily. At September 30, 2024 , the Company had pledged as collateral for these borrowings investment securities with an amortized cost and fair value of million and million, compared to an amortized cost and fair value of million and million at December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the Company entered the FRB s Borrower-In-Custody ("BIC") program, which allows for the pledging of various loan types to secure FRB borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had pledged loan collateral for FRB borrowings with an amortized cost and collateral value of million and million at September 30, 2024 , and million and million at December 31, 2023 , respectively. Borrowing capacity provided by pledged loan collateral is included in the FRB discount window availability. 
 
 The Company had million and million in other borrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. These borrowings consist of short-term repurchase agreements with certain commercial demand deposit customers for sweep accounts. The repurchase agreements typically mature within one to three days and the interest rate paid on these borrowings floats monthly with money market type rates. The interest rate paid on the repurchase agreements was at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Collateral pledged by the Company for these repurchase agreements consisted of investments with a combined amortized cost and fair value of million and million at September 30, 2024 , and million and million at December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 There were outstanding FHLB advances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . FHLB advances are secured by a blanket collateral agreement with the FHLB by pledging the Company s portfolio of residential first mortgage loans and investment securities. The Company's total pledged collateral for FHLB advances had an amortized cost and fair value of million and million at September 30, 2024 , and million and million at December 31, 2023 , respectively.

 In November 2019, the Company sold and issued to certain institutional investors million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2029 (the 10 -Year Notes and million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2034 (the 15 -Year Notes , and together with the 10 -Year Notes, the Notes ). 
 
 The 10 -Year Notes have a stated maturity of November 22, 2029, and bear interest at a fixed rate of per year, from and including November 22, 2019 but excluding November 22, 2024. In accordance with the terms of the 10 -Year Notes, from and including November 22, 2024 to but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate on the 10 -Year Notes shall reset semi-annually to an interest rate equal to the then-current three -month LIBOR rate plus basis points. 
 
 The 15 -Year Notes have a stated maturity of November 22, 2034, and bear interest at a fixed rate of per year, from and including November 22, 2019 but excluding November 22, 2029.

 As a result of the discontinuation of LIBOR effective June 30, 2023, the Company is currently in the process of determining an appropriate benchmark replacement for LIBOR on the Notes. The Company expects the replacement benchmark to be materially consistent with the three -month LIBOR. 
 
 The Notes are payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year commencing June 1, 2020. 
 
 The Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holder and may be redeemed by the Company only under certain limited circumstances prior to November 22, 2024, with respect to the 10 -Year Notes, and November 22, 2029, with respect to the 15 -Year Notes. The Company may redeem the 10 -Year Notes and the 15 -Year Notes at its option, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, on or after November 22, 2024 and November 22, 2029, respectively. The Notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of the Company and rank junior in right to payment to the Company s current and future senior indebtedness, and each Note is equal in right to payment with respect to the other Notes. 
 
 The Notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for the Company under applicable regulatory guidelines. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to fund the redemption of the convertible senior debentures and for general corporate purposes to support future growth.

Fair value is estimated using one of the following methods: fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, discounted cash flows, or market value of the loan based on similar debt. The fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell is the most frequently used method. Typically, the Company reviews the most recent appraisal and if it is over 24 months old will request a new third party appraisal. Depending on the particular circumstances surrounding the loan, including the location of the collateral, the date of the most recent appraisal and the value of the collateral relative to the recorded investment in the loan, management may order an independent appraisal immediately or, in some instances, may elect to perform an internal analysis. Specifically, as an example, in situations where the collateral on a nonperforming commercial real estate loan is out of the Company s primary market area, management would typically order an independent appraisal immediately, at the earlier of the date the loan becomes nonperforming or immediately following the determination that the loan is collateral dependent. However, as a second example, on a nonperforming commercial real estate loan where management is familiar with the property and surrounding areas and where the original appraisal value far exceeds the recorded investment in the loan, management may perform an internal analysis whereby the previous appraisal value would be reviewed and adjusted for current conditions including recent sales of similar properties in the area and any other relevant economic trends. These valuations are reviewed at a minimum on a quarterly basis. 
 
 Those collateral dependent loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. At September 30, 2024 , all collateral dependent loans were evaluated based on the fair value of the collateral. Loans where an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral require classification in the fair value hierarchy. The Company records collateral dependent loans as nonrecurring Level 3. 
 
 Other Real Estate Owned 
 
 Fair value adjustments to OREO are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount of the loan or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs. Any write-downs based on the asset s fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses. After foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its new cost basis or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Foreclosed assets are recorded as nonrecurring Level 3.

For assets and liabilities
 not presented on the balance sheet at fair value, the following methods are used to determine fair value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value. All mature within 90 days and do not present unanticipated credit concerns. 
 
 Certificates of Deposit with Other Banks Fair value is based on market prices for similar assets. 
 
 HTM Securities HTM securities are valued at quoted market prices or dealer quotes. 
 
 Loans Receivable, Net The fair value of loans is estimated using an exit price notion. The exit price notion uses a discounted cash flows technique to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows for a financial instrument and incorporates other factors such as enhanced credit risk, illiquidity risk and market factors that sometimes exist in exit prices in dislocated markets. The credit risk assumption is intended to approximate the fair value that a market participant would realize in a hypothetical orderly transaction. The Company s loan portfolio is initially fair valued using a segmented approach. The Company divides its loan portfolio into the following categories: construction, residential mortgage, commercial real estate, other commercial, HELOCs and other consumer loans. The results are then adjusted to account for credit risk as described above. A further credit risk discount must be applied using a discounted cash flow model to compensate for illiquidity risk, based on certain assumptions included within the discounted cash flow model, primarily the use of discount rates that better capture inherent credit risk over the lifetime of a loan. This consideration of enhanced credit risk provides an estimated exit price for the Company s loan portfolio. For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, fair values approximate carrying values. 
 
 FHLB Stock The fair value approximates the carrying value. 
 
 Deposits The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and money market accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposits is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 
 
 FHLB Advances and Borrowings from the FRB Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows with current market rates for borrowings with similar terms. The Company had no outstanding FHLB advances as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Other Borrowed Money The carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value. 
 
 Subordinated Debentures The fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar debenture offerings with similar terms and maturities would be issued by similar institutions. As discount rates are based on current debenture rates as well as management estimates, the fair values presented may not be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale. 
 
 Junior Subordinated Debentures The carrying value of junior subordinated debentures approximates fair value.

At September 30, 2024 , the Company had million in off-balanc e sheet financial commitments compared to million at December 31, 2023. These commitments are to originate loans and unused consumer lines of credit and credit card lines. Because these obligations are based on current market rates, if funded, the original principal amount is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value. Fair value estimates are made on a specific date, based on relevant market data and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. 
 
 Because no active market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, current interest rates and prepayment trends, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in any of these assumptions used in calculating fair value would also significantly affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For example, the Company has significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities including deposit franchise values, loan servicing portfolios, deferred tax liabilities, and premises and equipment. 
 
 In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates. The Company has used management s best estimate of fair value on the above assumptions. Thus, the fair values presented may not be the amounts which could be realized in an immediate sale or settlement of the instrument. In addition, any income taxes or other expenses that would be incurred in an actual sale or settlement are not taken into consideration in the fair value presented.

Cash and cash equivalents increased 4.1 million or 3.2 to 132.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 128.3 million at December 31, 2023 , primarily as a result of an increase in deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the proceeds received from the sales, paydowns and maturities of securities. 
 
 AFS securities decreased 3.4 million or 0.6 to 534.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 537.6 million at December 31, 2023 as sales, maturities and principal paydowns of AFS securities exceeded purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . HTM securities decreased 25.2 million to 137.9 million at September 30, 2024 , from 163.1 million at December 31, 2023, as a result of paydowns and maturities exceeding purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Total loans receivable, net, including loans held for sale, increased 64.2 million or 10.3 to 686.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 622.5 million at December 31, 2023 , primarily due to increases in real estate loans originated during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Residential mortgage loans increased 27.6 million or 16.0 to 200.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 172.9 million at December 31, 2023 .

Commercial and agricultural loans decreased 2.9 million or 8.6 to 30.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 33.3 million at December 31, 2023 and other consumer loans decreased slightly to 23.9 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 24.5 million at December 31, 2023 . Loans held for sale increased to 1.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 967,000 at December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Premises and equipment, net increased 908,000 or 3.2 to 29.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 28.6 million at December 31, 2023 as a result of improvements made to existing branches. 
 
 Other assets decreased 14.5 million or 49.5 to 14.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 29.2 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to the collection of an outstanding receivable from a matured investment security, which was received in the first quarter of 2024 after being outstanding at the end of 2023. 
 
 Liabilities 
 
 Deposit Accounts - Total deposits increased 62.3 million or 5.2 to 1.26 billion at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 , due to increases in higher cost certificates of deposit and money market accounts, partially offset by decreases in checking and savings accounts. The Bank had 25.8 million in brokered time deposits at September 30, 2024 compared to 5.2 million at December 31, 2023 . Most of the Bank s deposits are originated within the Bank s immediate market area; however, the Bank uses brokered time deposits to manage interest rate risk because they are accessible in bulk at rates typically only slightly higher than those in our market areas. A portion of these brokered time deposits give the Bank a call option that allows the Bank the choice to redeem them early should rates change. In addition, the Bank had 5.2 million and 5.0 million in other brokered deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. At September 30, 2024 , the Bank had no deposit relationships greater than 5 of outstanding deposits, compared to one deposit relationship totaling approximately 5.2 of outstanding deposits at December 31, 2023 . At September 30, 2024 , approximately 330.6 million or 26.3 of our 1.26 billion deposit portfolio was uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimates based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank s regulatory reporting requirements. For additional details of deposits, see Note 9 Deposits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Borrowings - The Bank had 65.0 million in borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta FRB at September 30, 2024 , compared to 119.2 million at December 31, 2023 . During the first quarter of 2023, the Bank elected to participate in the Federal Reserve's Bank Term Funding Program BTFP ), allowing the Bank to refinance its existing FRB borrowings. The Bank also had 24.3 million in other borrowings at September 30, 2024 , compared to 19.2 million and December 31, 2023 , which consisted of short-term repurchase agreements with certain commercial demand deposit customers for sweep accounts. For additional information, see Note 10 Borrowings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this report. 
 
 At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had 5.2 million in junior subordinated debentures and 26.5 million in subordinated debentures outstanding. Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company notified holders that it will redeem on November 22, 2024 all of the Company s outstanding 10-Year Notes due November 22, 2029, having an aggregate principal amount of 16.5 million, in accordance with the terms of the 10-Year Notes. The total redemption price will be 100 of the aggregate principal amount of the 10-Year Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. See Note 11 - Subordinated Debentures and Note 17 Subsequent Events of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this report for additional information. 
 
 Shareholders Equity 
 
 Shareholders equity increased 12.7 million or 7.4 to 185.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 172.4 million at December 31, 2023 . The increase was attributable to 5.9 million of net income and a 9.0 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss, partially offset by 1.4 million in dividends paid to common shareholders, 512,000 in preferred dividends paid, and 829,000 in Company stock repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

Results of Operations for the Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Net income available to common shareholders decreased 127,000, or 6.0 , to 2.0 million or 0.62 per basic common share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 2.1 million or 0.65 per basic common share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in net income available to common shareholders was primarily the result of increases in non-interest expense, the provision for credit losses and preferred stock dividends paid during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 , partly offset by higher net interest income and non-interest income. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 The following table compares detailed average balances, average yields on interest-earning assets, average costs of interest-bearing liabilities and the resulting changes in interest income and expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . The average balances were derived from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated. The average yields or costs were calculated by dividing the income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. Nonaccrual loans are included in earning assets in the following table. Loan yields have been reduced to reflect the negative impact on our earnings of loans on nonaccrual status. Interest income from non-taxable investments is calculated on a tax equivalent basis, which recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets and was calculated using the effective tax rate for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

Net interest income increased 965,000 or 10.2 to 10.4 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 9.4 million for the same quarter in 2023 due to increases in both average interest-earning assets and net interest margin. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , average interest-earning assets increased 82.6 million or 6.0 to 1.46 billion from 1.37 billion for the same quarter in 2023 , while average interest-bearing liabilities increased 84.9 million or 8.3 to 1.11 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 1.03 billion for the comparable quarter in 2023 . The Company's net interest margin was 2.87 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.76 for the comparable quarter in 2023 . The Company's net interest spread on a tax equivalent basis was 2.10 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.04 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 Total tax-equivalent interest income increased 2.7 million or 16.0 to 19.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16.9 million for the same period in 2023 . 
 
 Interest income on loans increased 2.2 million or 26.1 to 10.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 8.4 million for the third quarter of 2023 . The increase was the result of a 79.4 million increase in the average loan portfolio balance combined with a 63 basis point increase in the average yield on loans receivable as adjustable-rate loans reset and new loans were originated at higher market interest rates. 
 
 Interest income from taxable investments decreased 160,000 or 2.1 to 7.4 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , from 7.6 million for the third quarter of 2023 , due to a 38.9 million decrease in the average balance of taxable investments, which was partially offset by a 16 basis point increase in the average yield to 4.52 , reflecting higher market interest rates. Tax equivalent interest income from non-taxable investments decreased 70,000 to 89,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a 7.8 million decrease in the average balance of non-taxable investments, reflecting investment sales during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Interest income from deposits with other banks increased 748,000 to 1.5 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , from 703,000 for the third quarter of 2023 , due to a 49.8 million increase in the average balance of these assets combined with a 47 basis point increase in the average yield earned on these assets due to increased market interest rates.

Interest Expense 
 
 Total interest expense increased 1.7 million or 23.7 to 9.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.4 million for the same quarter in 2023 due to an increase in market interest rates combined with a 84.9 million increase in the average balance of these liabilities. 
 
 Interest expense on deposits increased 1.7 million to 7.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , from 6.1 million for the third quarter of 2023 , due to an increase of 46 basis points in the average cost combined with an 83.5 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposit accounts, reflecting growth in higher cost money market and certificate of deposit accounts. Interest expense on FRB and other borrowings increased 59,000 to 1.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , from 1.3 million for the third quarter of 2023 , due to an increase of four basis points in the average cost of these liabilities, reflecting higher market interest rates, combined with a 1.4 million increase in the average balance of these liabilities. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 The amount of the provision and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses for loans and unfunded commitments is determined by management s on-going monthly analysis. The Company has policies and procedures in place for evaluating and monitoring the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio and for timely identification of potential problem loans including internal and external loan reviews. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed monthly by the Asset Classification Committee and quarterly by the Board of Directors. 
 
 On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments Accounting Standards Codification 326, which replaced the incurred loss methodology with the CECL methodology. CECL requires an estimate of credit losses for the remaining estimated life of the financial asset using historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and generally applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities, and some off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded commitments to extend credit. 
 
 The Company recorded a 725,000 provision for credit losses on loans and a 145,000 reversal of provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments, resulting in a total provision for credit losses of 580,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , compared to no provision for credit losses during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in the provision during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily the result of loan growth and, to a less extent, higher charge-offs. Net charge-offs totaled 79,000 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a net recovery of 15,000 during the third quarter of 2023 . For additional information on the changes in the allowance for credit losses, see "Note 6 - Investments, AFS", "Note 7 - Investments, HTM, and Note 8 - Loans Receivable" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Non-Interest Income 
 
 Non-interest income increased 457,000 or 21.1 to 2.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was due to increases in all non-interest income line items except for service fees on deposit accounts during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . The largest increase came from trust income, which increased 263,000 to 721,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . Additional changes in non-interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 included a 48,000 increase in commission on insurance, a 74,000 increase in gain on sale of loans and a 37,000 gain on sales of AFS securities, as well as smaller increases in other categories. For additional details of the changes in non-interest income, see Note 14 - Non-Interest Income of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Non-Interest Expense 
 
 Non-interest expense increased 389,000 or 4.4 to 9.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . The following table summarizes the changes in non-interest expense:

Most of the increases in non-interest expenses during the third quarter of 2024 were due to the overall growth of the Company, increased operations and the addition of our newest branch in Augusta, Georgia which opened in April 2023. The largest increase in non-interest expense during the third quarter of 2024 was compensation and employee benefits expense, which increased 397,000 to 5.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 5.0 million during the same period in 2023. Cloud services increased 299,000 due to the reclassification of those expenses from depreciation and maintenance of equipment expense, which decreased 360,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Provision For Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes increased 28.9 to 732,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , from 568,000 for the same period in 2023 , due to higher pre-tax net income. Pre-tax net income was 3.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.7 million for the third quarter of 2023 . The Company s combined federal and state effective income tax rate was 23.3 and 21.1 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively.

Interest income from non-taxable investments is calculated on a tax equivalent basis, which recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets and was calculated using the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

Net interest income increased 1.8 million or 6.1 to 30.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 28.8 million for the same nine months in 2023 , due to an increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decline in net interest margin. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , average interest-earning assets increased 108.5 million or 8.1 to 1.45 billion from 1.34 billion for the same nine months in 2023 , while average interest-bearing liabilities increased 116.0 million or 11.7 to 1.11 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 992.8 million for the comparable nine months in 2023 . The Company's net interest margin was 2.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.88 for the comparable nine months in 2023 , as higher funding costs continued to exert pressure on our net interest margin. The Company's net interest spread on a tax equivalent basis was 2.08 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 Total tax-equivalent interest income increased 10.5 million or 22.4 to 57.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 46.7 million for the same period in 2023 . 
 
 Interest income on loans increased 6.3 million or 26.4 to 30.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 23.9 million for the nine months of 2023 . The increase was the result of a 73.4 million increase in the average loan portfolio balance combined with a 66 basis point increase in the average yield on loans receivable as adjustable-rate loans reset and new loans were originated at higher market interest rates. 
 
 Interest income from taxable investments increased 1.3 million or 6.4 to 22.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , from 21.0 million for the nine months of 2023 , due to a 46 basis point increase in the average yield to 4.49 , reflecting higher market interest rates, which was partially offset by a 31.3 million decrease in the average balance of taxable investments. Tax equivalent interest income from non-taxable investments decreased 106,000 to 470,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a 3.2 million decrease in the average balance of non-taxable investments and a 13 basis point decrease in the average yield. 
 
 Interest income from deposits with other banks increased 2.9 million to 4.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , from 1.2 million for the nine months of 2023 , due to a 69.6 million increase in the average balance of these assets combined with a 50 basis point increase in the average yield earned due to increased market interest rates. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Total interest expense increased 8.7 million or 49.0 to 26.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.8 million for the same nine months in 2023 due to an increase in market interest rates combined with a 98.5 million increase in the average balance of these liabilities. 
 
 Interest expense on deposits increased 7.8 million to 21.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , from 14.2 million for the nine months of 2023 , due to an increase of 84 basis points in the average cost combined with a 98.5 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposit accounts, reflecting growth in higher-cost money market and certificate of deposit accounts. Interest expense on FRB and other borrowings increased 929,000 to 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , from 3.6 million for the nine months of 2023 , due to a 17.4 million increase in the average balance of these liabilities combined with an increase of 29 basis points in the average cost.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 The Company recorded a 1.2 million provision for credit losses on loans and a 110,000 reversal of provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments, resulting in a total provision for credit losses of 1.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to a 376,000 provision for credit losses on loans and a 155,000 reversal of provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments, resulting in a total provision for credit losses of 221,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in the provision during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was primarily the result of loan growth and higher net charge-offs. Net charge-offs totaled 165,000 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to a net recovery of 10,000 during the first nine months of 2023 . For additional information on the changes in the allowance for credit losses, see "Note 6 - Investments, AFS", "Note 7 - Investments, HTM, and Note 8 - Loans Receivable" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Non-Interest Income 
 
 Non-interest income increased 780,000 or 11.8 to 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was primarily due to a 480,000 increase in trust income. Additional changes in non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a 55,000 increase in commissions on insurance and a 75,000 increase in ATM and check card fee income, as well as smaller increase in other categories. For additional details of the changes in non-interest income, see Note 14 - Non-Interest Income of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Non-Interest Expense 
 
 Non-interest expense increased 1.8 million or 6.5 to 28.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 26.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The following table summarizes the changes in non-interest expense:

Most of the increases in non-interest expenses during the nine months of 2024 were due to overall growth of the Company, increased operations and the addition of our newest branch in Augusta, Georgia which opened in April 2023. The largest increase in non-interest expense during the nine months of 2024 was compensation and employee benefits expense, which increased 1.2 million to 16.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 15.2 million during the same period in 2023. In addition, cloud services increased 703,000 due to the reclassification of those expenses from depreciation and maintenance of equipment expense, which decreased 547,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in 2023. Other expenses increased 154,000 or 4.2 to 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Provision For Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes increased 103,000 or 5.8 to 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , up from 1.8 million for the same period in 2023 . The Company s combined federal and state effective income tax rate was 22.7 and 21.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively.

 The U.S. Department of the Treasury s Community Development Financial Institutions ("CDFI") Fund released a revised CDFI Certification Application on December 7, 2023. On June 20, 2024, the CDFI announced an extension to the recertification filing deadline that now requires applications to be submitted by December 31, 2025. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the revised Certification Application requirements and completing its recertification as a CDFI. Being a CDFI certified institution offers several benefits, including, among others: 

Access to Funding: CDFI certification provides access to various funding opportunities, including grants, loans, and investment capital from the CDFI Fund, a part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. This funding can assist the Bank in expanding its services and reach more underserved communities. 

Tax Incentives: CDFIs may be eligible for tax credits, such as the New Markets Tax Credit, which can attract private investment to low-income communities by providing investors with tax credits for investments made in economically distressed areas. 

Enhanced Credibility: Certification enhances the credibility and reputation of the Bank, signaling to investors and customers that the institution is committed to community development and financial inclusion. 

Technical Assistance: CDFIs can receive technical assistance from the CDFI Fund and other organizations, which can help them improve their operations, develop new products, and implement best practices. 

Regulatory Benefits: Some regulatory benefits, such as exemptions or modifications to certain banking regulations, may be available to CDFIs, making it easier for them to serve their target markets. 

Overall, CDFI certification can significantly enhance an institution's ability to serve its community and achieve its mission of promoting economic growth and financial inclusion in underserved areas. No assurance can be given as to whether the Company will receive approval of its certification to continue as a CDFI.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Liquidity Commitments, Capital Resources, and Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 We actively analyze and manage liquidity with the objective of maintaining an adequate level of liquidity and to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to support loan growth, fund deposit withdrawals, fund operations, and satisfy other financial commitments. See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows contained in Item 1 Financial Statements, herein. 
 
 The Bank's primary sources of funds include deposits, scheduled loan and investment securities repayments, including interest payments, maturities and sales of loans and investment securities, advances from the FRB, and cash flow generated from operations. The sources of funds, together with retained earnings and equity, are used to make loans, acquire investment securities and other assets, and fund continuing operations. While maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage repayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Management believes that the Company s current liquidity position and its forecasted operating results are sufficient to fund all its existing commitments. The Bank had 148.1 million in unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit at September 30, 2024 . 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , loan disbursements exceeded loan repayments resulting in a 64.7 million increase in total net loans receivable. Also, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , deposits increased 62.3 million. The Bank had no outstanding FHLB advances at September 30, 2024 with 443.8 million in total borrowing capacity at the FHLB at that date. The Bank had 65.0 million of outstanding borrowings from the FRB discount window at September 30, 2024 , which was collateralized by investments with a fair market value of 361.4 million at that date. The Bank also had a 50.0 million unused Fed Funds facility with Pacific Coast Bankers Bank at September 30, 2024 . Subject to market conditions, we expect to utilize these borrowing facilities from time to time in the future to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals, to satisfy other financial commitments, repay maturing debt and to take advantage of investment opportunities to the extent feasible. 
 
 The Bank's liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposits with other banks and AFS investments totaled 640.9 million at September 30, 2024 . Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2024 totaled 222.0 million. Historically, the Bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature. 
 
 Security Federal is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. At September 30, 2024 , Security Federal had liquid assets of 50.3 million. In addition to its operating expenses, Security Federal is responsible for paying any dividends declared, if any, to its shareholders, funds paid for Security Federal stock repurchases, and payments on trust-preferred securities and subordinated debentures held at the Company level. Security Federal's main source of funds are dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. We currently expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock subject to our Board of Directors discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is 0.14 per share which we believe is a dividend rate per share which enables us to balance our multiple objectives of managing and investing in the Bank, and returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. Assuming continued payment during 2024 at this rate of 0.14 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately 484,000 based on the number of outstanding shares at September 30, 2024 . 
 
 In June 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to three percent, or approximately 97,612 shares, of the Company s outstanding common stock as of that date. On August 19, 2024 the Company's Board of Directors announced an additional 100,000 shares available to be purchased under the program. In general, stock-repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , the Company repurchased 2,500 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of 60,000, leaving 35,276 shares available for further repurchase under the existing stock repurchase program at September 30, 2024 . The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares. For additional information, see Part II, Item 2 - Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 Additionally, Security Federal Corporation will redeem all of the Company s outstanding 10-Year Notes, having an aggregate principal amount of 16.5 million, on November 22, 2024. The total redemption price will be 100 of the aggregate principal amount of the 10-Year Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Company will utilize excess cash on hand for the redemption payment 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1), Tier 1 leverage-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, and total risk-based capital ratios of 18.0 , 10.3 , 18.0 , and 19.2 , respectively. To be categorized as well capitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions the Bank must maintain minimum CET1, total risk based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios of 6.5 , 10.0 , 8.0 and 5.0 , respectively. In addition to the minimum capital requirements, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer, which consists of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5 of risk weighted assets above the required minimum levels to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. At September 30, 2024 the Bank s conservation buffer was 11.2 . For additional details, see Note 12 - Regulatory Matters of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this report.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in its lending, investment, deposit and borrowing activities. Management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure. Although the Company manages other risks such as credit quality and liquidity risk in the normal course of business, management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk that could potentially have the largest material effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Other types of market risks such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price do not arise in the normal course of the Company s business activities. 
 
 The Company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in the market interest rate. Management s goal is to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations and earnings. A sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact the Company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not change at the same rate, to the same extent or on the same basis. The Company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using a test that measures the impact on net interest income and net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in 100 basis point increments. Net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. There were no material changes in information concerning market risk from the information provided in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Bank's interest rate spread, defined as the average yield on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.08 . 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a) 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a - 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Act )) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and several other members of the Company s senior management as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that at September 30, 2024 the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 

(b) 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and or fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

On June 23, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to three percent, or approximately 97,612 shares, of the Company s outstanding common stock as of that date. The June 2023 repurchase program does not have a set expiration date and will expire upon repurchase of the full amount of authorized shares. The repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate.
