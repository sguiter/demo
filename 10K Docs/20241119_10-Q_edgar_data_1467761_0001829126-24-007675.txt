for each share of common stock issued and outstanding. All shares and associated amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split. 

Liquidity 

The Company s operations have historically been financed through the issuance of common stock and borrowings. Since inception, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 4.4 ) million, and used cash from operations of 3.8 ) million, which was offset by 3.3 million in cash provided from financing activities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 96.8 ) million and cash and cash equivalents of 0.2 million. The Company will continue to monitor its costs in relation to its sales and adjust its cost structure accordingly. Management of the Company believes it will not have sufficient resources to continue as a going concern through at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. 

Merger Agreement with e2 Companies, LLC 

On March 12, 2024, the Company , and its wholly owned subsidiary, MME Sub 1 LLC, a Florida limited liability company Merger Sub ), formed in March 2024, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger Merger Agreement with e2Companies LLC, a Florida limited liability company e2Companies ). The Merger Agreement did not close by the end date, and as such, by the terms of the agreement,
in July 2024 it terminated of its own accord. 

Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations 

The remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. Unsatisfied and partially unsatisfied performance obligations consist of contract liabilities, in-transit orders with destination terms, and non-cancellable backlog. Non-cancellable backlog includes goods for which customer purchase orders have been accepted, that are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment, and that are not yet invoiced. 

Contract costs 

The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the Company expects the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. The Company has determined that certain sales commissions meet the requirements to be capitalized, and the Company amortizes these costs on a consistent basis with the pattern of transfer of the goods and services in the contract. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

The Company applies a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract when the amortization period is one year or less. These costs include sales commissions on SaaS contracts with a contract period of one year or less as sales commissions on contract renewals are commensurate with those paid on the initial contract. 

Contract Balances 

The Company records accounts receivable when it has an unconditional right to the consideration. The Company did t have contract liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, 

(b) Vendor Obligation Releases 

In its efforts to manage its liquidity and cash-flow position, the Company negotiated and executed liability release agreements with certain vendors in Q4 2023 who comprised million of outstanding accounts payable as of December 31, 2023. In aggregate, the executed release agreements resulted in a reduction of outstanding accounts payable obligations by 3.6 million from 5.0 million to 1.4 million. The executed release agreements became effective and are contingent upon payment of the million negotiated amounts received during the period of Q1 2024. In addition, the Company agreed to pay certain vendors an additional million contingent upon successful collection of customer receivables. After the collection of customer receivables, the contingent amount was amended to million during the period ended September 30, 2024. In July 2024, the Company paid the contingent amount of million to its vendors. 

(c) Contingencies 

The Company is party to various lawsuits and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company evaluates such lawsuits and proceedings on a case-by-case basis, and its policy is to vigorously contest any such claims which it believes are without merit. 

The Company reviews the status of its legal proceedings and records a provision for a liability when it is considered probable that both a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This review is updated periodically as additional information becomes available. If both criteria are not met, the Company reassesses whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss, or additional losses, may be incurred. If there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, the Company discloses the estimate of the amount of the loss or range of losses - that the amount is not material, or that an estimate of the loss cannot be made. At September 30, 2024, the Company is not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to the Company, in management s opinion, are currently expected to individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, operating results or financial condition taken as a whole. The Company expenses its legal fees as incurred. 

In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is subject to lawsuits, arbitrations, claims, and other legal proceedings in connection with their business. Some of the legal actions include claims for substantial or unspecified compensatory and/or punitive damages. A substantial adverse judgment or other unfavorable resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Management believes that the Company has adequate legal defenses with respect to the legal proceedings to which it is a defendant or respondent, and that the outcome of these pending proceedings is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. However, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters. 

in the aggregate of the Company s total net sales. At September 30, 2023, two companies with an accounts receivable balance of 10 or greater individually accounted for a combined of the Company s accounts receivable. 

The Company s customers generally do not enter into long-term agreements obligating them to purchase products. The Company may not continue to receive significant revenues from any of these or from other large customers. A reduction or delay in orders from any of the Company s significant customers, or a delay or default in payment by any significant customer could materially harm the Company s business and prospects. Because of the Company s significant customer concentration, its net sales and operating income could fluctuate significantly due to changes in political or economic conditions, or the loss, reduction of business, or less favorable terms for any of the Company s significant customers. The Company participates in the PC peripherals industry, which is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, continually changing customer demand patterns and rapid technological developments. The Company s operating results could be adversely affected should the Company be unable to successfully anticipate customer demand accurately; manage its product transitions, inventory levels and manufacturing process efficiently; distribute its products quickly in response to customer demand; differentiate its products from those of its competitors or compete successfully in the markets for its new products. 

The Company depends on many third-party suppliers for key components contained in its product offerings. For some of these components, the Company may only use a single source supplier, in part due to the lack of alternative sources of supply. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any concentration of suppliers. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had one supplier that provided of the Company s purchased inventory.

shares of the Company s preferred stock, par value per share (the Preferred Stock ), at a price per share of , for an aggregate purchase price of , subject to the conditions described below, pursuant to the exemptions afforded by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Regulation S thereunder. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to designate of the Preferred Stock as Series A Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock for the sale to Lazar (or a Lazar Transferee). Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1.4 shares of common stock of the Company, 0.01 par value per share (the Common Stock ), and vote on an as-if-converted basis and shall have full ratchet protection in any subsequent offerings. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company shall also issue Lazar (or a Lazar Transferee) warrants to purchase up to an additional 2,800,000 shares of Common Stock, with an exercise price equal to 1.00 per share, subject to adjustment therein (the Warrants , and together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the Purchased Securities ). 

The Company evaluated the Series A Preferred Stock and Warrants for liability or equity classification in accordance with the provisions of ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , and determined that equity treatment was appropriate because neither the Series A Preferred Stock nor the Warrants met the definition of liability instruments. 

The Warrants are classified as component of permanent equity because they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the shares of common stock with which they were issued, are immediately exercisable, do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, and permit the holder to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. In addition, the Warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return. The Company valued the Warrants at issuance using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and determined the fair value of the Warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at million. The key inputs to the valuation model included a weighted average volatility of and an expected term of years. 

The proceeds from the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock to the Company were allocated based on the relative fair value of the Warrants as compared to the fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock. The fair value of the Warrants incorporates assumptions regarding our common stock price, dividend yield, stock price volatility, as well as assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate. Using this model, the Warrants was valued at million at January 23, 2024 and was included in additional paid in capital on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

The fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock was determined based on assumptions that incorporated our common stock price and dividend rate. The Company valued the Series A Preferred Stock at million. Based on the fair value model to allocate the Series A Preferred Stock proceeds, the Series A Preferred Stock was valued at million at January 23, 2024 and was included in Series A Preferred Stock on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

On February 26, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, who voted and approved (i) the issuance of shares of our common stock, par value 0.01 per share Common Stock upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock or exercise of the Warrants to be issued at Closing of the Purchase Agreement, which conversions or exercise would result in a change of control of the Company under the applicable rules of Nasdaq and (ii) an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect the increase in authorized shares of Preferred Stock to .

Overview 

We historically delivered comprehensive WiFi as a Service platform to make everyone s connected home safe and supportive for life and work. 

Generally, our gross margin for a given product depends on a number of factors, including the type of customer to whom we were selling. The gross margin for products sold to retailers tended to be higher than for some of our other customers; but the sales, support, returns, and overhead costs associated with products sold to retailers also tended to be higher. 

Our cash and cash equivalents balance on September 30, 2024 was 0.2 million compared to 0.7 million on December 31, 2023. On September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings and working capital of negative 0.8 million. 

The Company s ability to maintain adequate levels of liquidity depends in part on our ability to sell inventory on hand and collect related receivables. The Company is evaluating options related to its liquidity. The Company will continue to monitor its costs in relation to its sales and adjust its cost structure accordingly. 

16 

The Company continues to experience losses, which in part is due to declining revenues. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated net sales of 0 million and 6.7 million, respectively, and 0.6 million and 24.6 million, respectively. 

Our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 12, 2024, provides additional information about our business and operations. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Report on 10-Q, for a full description of recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on the financial condition and results of operations, which are hereby incorporated by reference. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Management bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial statements may be affected. Our management evaluates its estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. 

Our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are revenue recognition, product returns, inventory valuation and costs of goods sold, warrants, valuation of deferred tax assets are described under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates.

The majority of the Company s revenues by geographic area are earned in North America for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net Sales 

Our total net sales decreased year-over-year by 6.7 million or 100 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and by 24.0 million or 97.4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in net sales is directly attributable to decreased sales of Motorola branded cable modems and gateways. In 2023, we primarily generated our sales by selling cable modems and gateways. Sales related to SaaS offerings were 0 thousand and 3 thousand in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0 thousand and 164 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in other category of 244 thousand in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended in September 30, 2023 and the decrease of 567 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to a reduction in DSL and MoCA products. Generally, our lower sales outside North America reflect the fact that cable modems are sold successfully through retailers in the U.S. but not in most countries outside the U.S., due primarily to variations in government regulations. 

Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin 

Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the following: the cost of finished products from our third-party manufacturers; overhead costs, including purchasing, product planning, inventory control, warehousing and distribution logistics; third-party software licensing fees; inbound freight; import duties/tariffs; warranty costs associated with returned goods; write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory; amortization of certain acquired intangibles and software development costs; and costs attributable to the provision of service offerings. 

The decrease in gross profit was attributable to less sales, largely resulting from the Motorola license termination. Our gross margin can be affected by a number of factors, including fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, sales returns, changes in average selling prices, end-user customer rebates and other channel sales incentives, changes in our cost of goods sold due to fluctuations and increases in prices paid for components, overhead costs, inbound freight and duty/tariffs, conversion costs, and charges for excess or obsolete inventory.

Gross profit decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended in the prior fiscal year period, primarily due to insufficient sales levels necessary to cover fixed costs and certain variable costs. Gross profit decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended in the prior fiscal year period, primarily due decreased sales of Motorola branded cable modems and gateways. 

For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we expect gross margin to decrease in sales of Motorola branded cable modems and gateways. Our cost of goods sold, as a percentage of net sales, can vary significantly based upon factors such as: uncertainties surrounding revenue volumes, including the timing of sales. 

Selling and Marketing 

Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising, trade shows, corporate communications and other marketing expenses, product marketing expenses, outbound freight costs, amortization of certain intangibles, personnel expenses for sales and marketing staff, technical support expenses, and facility allocations.

Selling and marketing expenses decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to reductions in personnel expenses by 0.3 million, Motorola royalty fees of 1.7 million, and other sales support costs of 0.1 million. Selling and marketing expenses decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to reductions in personnel expenses by 1.4 million, marketing campaigns by 2.2 million, Motorola royalty fees of 5.1 million, and other sales support costs of 0.6 million. 

For the remainder of the fiscal year 2024, we expect our selling and marketing expenses to decrease compared to the first three quarters of 2024. Expenses may fluctuate depending on sales levels achieved as certain expenses, and are determined based upon the net sales achieved. Forecasting both selling and marketing expenses is highly dependent on expected net sales levels and could vary significantly depending on actual net sales achieved in any given quarter. Marketing expenses may also fluctuate depending upon the timing, extent and nature of marketing programs. 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executives, finance and accounting, human resources, information technology, professional fees, including legal costs associated with defending claims against us, allowance for doubtful accounts, facility allocations, and other general corporate expenses.

General and administrative expenses decreased 0.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of 0.3 million and software subscriptions of 0.1 million. General and administrative expenses decreased 1.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in personnel expenses of 0.8 million and professional fees of 0.4 million. 

Future general and administrative expense increases or decreases in absolute dollars are difficult to predict due to the lack of visibility of certain costs, including legal costs associated with defending claims against us, and other factors. 

19 

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, payments to suppliers for design services, safety and regulatory testing, product certification expenditures to qualify our products for sale into specific markets, prototypes, IT, and other consulting fees. Research and development expenses are recognized as they are incurred. Our research and development organization is focused on enhancing our ability to introduce innovative and easy-to-use products and services.

The decrease of 0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to decreases in personnel expenses of 0.5 million, professional fees of 0.1 million, and other support costs of 0.1 million. The decrease of 3.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to decreases in personnel expenses of 2.3 million, contract labor of 0.2 million, professional fees of 0.2 million, and certification and other costs of 0.5 million. 

For the remainder of the fiscal year 2024, we expect research and development expenses to decrease compared to the first three quarters of 2024. Research and development expenses may fluctuate depending on the timing and number of development activities and could vary significantly as a percentage of net sales, depending on actual net sales achieved in any given year. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 0.2 million as compared to 0.7 million on December 31, 2023. On September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding and working capital of negative 0.8 million. We have funded our operations and financing activities primarily through sale of preferred stock. 

Our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with: (1) cash used for operating activities such as the purchase and growth of inventory, expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development infrastructure and other working capital needs; (2) expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing capacity and improving our manufacturing efficiency; (3) capital expenditures related to the acquisition of equipment; (4) cash used to repay our debt obligations and related interest expense; and (5) cash used for acquisitions. Fluctuations in our working capital due to timing differences of our cash receipts and cash disbursements also impact our cash inflows and outflows. 

Our consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2024, were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern, and we will require additional liquidity to continue operations beyond the next 12 months. 

Our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities, and reported expenses that may be necessary if we were unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or part of their investment.

Future Liquidity Needs 

Our primary short-term needs for capital, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to: 

the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities; 

upgrades to our information technology infrastructure to enhance our capabilities and improve overall productivity; 

support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products, including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources; 

the continued advancement of research and development activities. 

21 

Our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control. We expect that our product sales and the resulting operating loss, as well as the status of each of our product development programs, will significantly impact our cash management decisions. 

At September 30, 2024, we believe our current cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and operations during the next twelve months. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce or contain expenditures and increase revenues. Based on these factors, management determined that there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will continue to monitor its costs in relation to its sales and adjust accordingly. 

Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including the extent and duration of any future operating losses, the level and timing of future sales and expenditures, the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs, working capital required to support our sales growth, funds required to service our debt, the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals, our sales and marketing programs, our need for infrastructure to support our sales growth, the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace, competing technologies and changes in the market and regulatory environment. 

Our ability to fund our longer-term cash needs is subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control See Risk Factors We may require significant additional capital to pursue our growth strategy, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our growth strategy. Should we require additional funding, such as additional capital investments, we may need to raise the required additional funds through bank borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We cannot guarantee that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us, if at all. 

At September 30, 2024, we have Federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately 79.4 million and 48.0 million, respectively, available to reduce future taxable income. A valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of deferred income tax assets as management has concluded that it is more-likely than-not that the benefits from such assets will not realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets. As a result, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. 

Commitments and Contractual Obligations 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, except as otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q, there were no material changes to our capital commitments and contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may be a party to litigation or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe we are party to any claim or litigation; the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

Suspension of Trading on Nasdaq: 

As previously reported, on July 22, 2024, we received a letter (the Letter from the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel, stating that the Company s appeal to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel Panel of the Nasdaq Listings Qualification staff s (the Staff delist determination dated June 26, 2024, for the Company s failure to maintain compliance with the equity requirement in Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) had been abandoned. However, the Company has not abandoned its request for a hearing. Due to a clerical error, the Company was unaware of the passage of the time required to provide a written submission prior to the oral hearing in front of the Panel, until July 23, 2024. 

On
July 23, 2024, we immediately filed a submission in support of an appeal to the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council regarding the
hearing abandonment determination and the future delisting of the Company s securities from Nasdaq, and on July 24, 2024 we
remitted an additional 15,000 for this appeal to the Listing Council the following day. 

We strongly believe that such appeal should be granted, and that the delisting action referenced in the Staff s determination letter, dated June 26, 2024, should continue to remain stayed, pending a final written decision by the Panel, due to the Company s particular circumstances. Following such appeal, and in anticipation of being granted an oral hearing in front of the Panel, the Company has put in place a plan (the Plan to regain compliance with the terms of the minimum stockholders equity requirement of at least 2,500,000 for continued inclusion on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and has delivered such Plan to the Panel. Nevertheless on July 24, 2024, the Company s securities trading was suspended on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq effective with the open of business on July 24, 2024, at which point the Company s common stock was eligible to trade on the OTC Market s Pink Current Information. Our securities trading has merely been suspended on Nasdaq at this time, not delisted. It will not be delisted unless and until Nasdaq files a Form 25 Notification of Delisting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after all internal procedural periods have run. 

The NASDAQ Office of General Counsel did not respond to our notice of intent to appeal to the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council regarding the hearing abandonment determination and the future delisting of the Company s securities from Nasdaq until August 1, 2024, the date originally scheduled for the Panel hearing, when we received a message which stated that the NASDAQ is unable to consider an appeal to the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council in this matter. The NASDAQ s position is that pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5820, companies may appeal Panel Decisions to the Listing Council. However, in our matter, there was no Hearing and there is no Panel Decision to appeal. The NASDAQ further indicated that the information regarding our right to appeal to the Listing Council which was included in the letter confirming abandonment of the appeal appears to have been included in error, and that it would issue a refund for the appeal fee, thus informing us that this matter was not appealable to the Listing Council. 

Following some discussions and correspondence with the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel, on August 12, 2024 we delivered a letter to the Nasdaq stating that the Company is of the view that the NASDAQ has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in making its determinations concerning our continued listing, has acted inconsistent with prior precedent, as well as inconsistent with Nasdaq s own Listing Rules, including, inter alia, Rule 5840(f) governing the delivery of documents which requires that the NASDAQ in these circumstances utilize all methods of communications; Rules 5814(a)(4) and (5) governing the scheduling of a hearing and the timing for submission of Written Submissions and Written Updates; Rule 5820 as presently in effect which provides the Listing Council broad discretion to review this matter, a review for which the Company had duly applied and paid for; as well as a number of additional Rules. We requested the Nasdaq Office of the General Counsel allow us to present its case to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, as soon thereafter as possible, or alternatively to be allowed to appeal to the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council the determination of deemed abandonment of the Hearing Request. We also requested that the suspension in the trading of our shares be lifted pending final resolution of the above matters and a final decision to delist having been made following the Company s exhaustion of all available administrative relief. 

24 

On August 13, 2024 we were notified by the Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of the Nasdaq that its position remains unchanged. On the same day, Company counsel responded to the Nasdaq that we intend to immediately seek injunctive and equitable relief against the NASDAQ at a court of competent authority, and that we would expect the Nasdaq will not take any further steps to affect the status quo. 

We believe the delisting decision, and specifically the deemed abandonment of our appeal to the Panel constituted, inter alia : (i) a breach of contract by Nasdaq, (ii) an abuse of NASDAQ s discretionary authority, (iii) breach of NASDAQ s listing rules as approved by the SEC, and (iv) material procedural unfairness. NASDAQ s staff subjectively determined that we were deemed to have abandoned our appeal to the Panel without any basis whatsoever in NASDAQ s listing rules as approved by the SEC for making such a determination. NASDAQ s decision, and the subsequent suspension of the trading in our shares, caused, and continues to cause, irreparable harm to our operations, our reputation and our shareholders. It has also severely negatively impacted our ability to execute on already announced and signed contracts. 

In light of the above, we filed for, and on August 20, 2024, were granted a temporary restraining order TRO by the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Kings County (the State Court ). The application for the TRO was filed by the Company in order to prohibit The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq from delisting the Company s common stock from Nasdaq. The TRO was effective until September 5, 2024. On August 20, 2024, following the State Court s grant of the TRO, Nasdaq removed the case to federal court. On September 4, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York remanded the case to the State Court. On September 5, 2024, the parties entered into a stipulation which was ordered by the State Court on September 6, 2024, to extend the TRO until September 30, 2024, at which point oral arguments were to be heard by the State Court. 

That TRO continued until, on October 18, 2024, the Court denied the request by the Company for a preliminary injunction enjoining the Nasdaq from taking further action to delist the Company. We subsequently, on October 22, 2024 discontinued our case against the Nasdaq, without prejudice. On October 23, 2024, the Nasdaq issued a press release announcing that it will delist our common stock and file a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). On October 24, 2024, the Nasdaq filed a Form 25 with the SEC, announcing its determination to remove from listing the securities of the Company, effective at the opening of the trading session on November 4, 2024, stating, inter alia , that Nasdaq filed the Form 25 pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5830 because all available review and appeal procedures and periods available to us under Nasdaq Rules have expired. 

On October 25, 2024, we filed with the SEC an Application for Review, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.S. 78s(d), the October 24, 2024 decision of Nasdaq to delist the Company s securities and to deny us the right to a hearing on such delisting, by incorrectly deeming our appeal abandoned, and then denying us the right to appeal Nasdaq s decision deeming our right to a hearing as abandoned requests. In conjunction with the submission of this appeal, we also submitted to the SEC a motion for an emergency stay of the delisting, pursuant to the SEC s Rule of Practice 401. On November 1, 2024, the SEC granted us an administrative stay of the delisting pending further order of the SEC, to give the SEC an opportunity to consider the Company s motion for a stay. The SEC noted in its order that the administrative stay should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of our motion for a preliminary stay. 

We continue to vigorously dispute the certifications included by Nasdaq in its Form 25 regarding Minim s delisting, as we believe we were not allowed any review and appeal procedures available under the Nasdaq Rules.

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 12, 2024, which includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors , which discussion is hereby incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1A. Our Risk Factors could materially affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and the additional ones described below, are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. 

We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to close the Purchase Agreement with the Investors for 2,600,000 which we entered into on November 13, 2024 and regain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are unable to regain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we will not be able to close the Purchase Agreement and we could be subject to final delisting or other adverse action, which could negatively impact the trading of our common stock. 

As
disclosed previously and in Item 1 above in Part II of this Current Report on Form 10-Q, on June 26, 2024, the Company received a
letter from the listing staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq that the Company was no longer in compliance
with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1)
(the Stockholders Equity Rule ). The Stockholders Equity Rule requires companies listed on the Nasdaq
Capital Market to maintain stockholders equity of at least 2,500,000 or to meet alternatives of market value of listed
securities or net income from continuing operations, which the Company does not currently meet. In response to the letter, we
submitted a request to submit our appeal and plan to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule to the Nasdaq
Hearings Panel (the Panel ). On July 22, 2024, we received a letter (the Letter from the Nasdaq Office
of General Counsel, stating that the Company s appeal to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel Panel of the Nasdaq
Listings Qualification staff s (the Staff delist determination dated June 26, 2024, for the Company s
failure to maintain compliance with the equity requirement in Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) had been abandoned. However, the Company has
not abandoned its request for a hearing. Due to a clerical error, the Company was unaware of the passage of the time required to
provide a written submission prior to the oral hearing in front of the Panel, until July 23, 2024. On July 23rd, we immediately
filed a submission in support of an appeal to the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council regarding the hearing abandonment
determination and the future delisting of the Company s securities from Nasdaq, and on July 24, 2024 we remitted an additional
 15,000 for this appeal to the Listing Council the following day. 

We strongly believe that such appeal should be granted, and that the delisting action referenced in the Staff s determination letter, dated June 26, 2024, should continue to remain stayed, pending a final written decision by the Panel, due to the Company s particular circumstances. Following such appeal, and in anticipation of being granted an oral hearing in front of the Panel, the Company put in place a plan (the Plan to regain compliance with the terms of the minimum stockholders equity requirement of at least 2,500,000 for continued inclusion on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and delivered such Plan to the Panel.

Our securities trading has merely been suspended on Nasdaq at this time, not delisted. It will not be delisted unless and until Nasdaq files a Form 25 Notification of Delisting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after all internal procedural periods have run. 

The NASDAQ Office of General Counsel did not respond to our notice of intent to appeal to the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council regarding the hearing abandonment determination and the future delisting of the Company s securities from Nasdaq until August 1, 2024, the date originally scheduled for the Panel hearing, when we received a message which stated that the NASDAQ is unable to consider an appeal to the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council in this matter. The NASDAQ s position is that pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5820, companies may appeal Panel Decisions to the Listing Council. However, in our matter, there was no Hearing and there is no Panel Decision to appeal. The NASDAQ further indicated that the information regarding our right to appeal to the Listing Council which was included in the letter confirming abandonment of the appeal appears to have been included in error, and that it would issue a refund for the appeal fee, thus informing us that this matter was not appealable to the Listing Council.

27 

As disclosed on our Form 8-K filed
with the Commission on November 18, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with
Cao Yu, an individual Cao ), Hu Bin, an individual, and Youxin Consulting Limited, a Hong Kong company (the Investors ),
whereby, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the Closing ), subject to satisfaction
of certain closing conditions, including our stockholders voting in favor of the transaction at a Special Meeting, we will sell and the
Investors will purchase 1,984,733 shares of the Company s newly formed Series preferred stock, 0.001 par value per share (the Preferred
Stock ), at a price per share of 1.31, for an aggregate purchase price of 2,600,000, subject to the conditions described below,
pursuant to the exemptions afforded by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Regulation S thereunder. 

The Purchase Agreement contains
customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Investors, limitations and conditions regarding sales of the
Purchased Securities or underlying Common Stock, indemnification rights and other obligations of the parties. Furthermore, the Purchase
Agreement contains certain conditions to closing, including: (i) a resolution appointing three (3) individuals identified in writing by
the Investors to fill the vacancies on the Board of Directors caused by the resignations of all of the members of the Board of Directors
as of the Closing Date, (ii) satisfactory evidence that all reasonably required waivers and/or settlement agreements with the Company s
creditors, vendors and employees have been received, (iii) the Certificate of Designation of the rights and privileges of the Series B
Preferred Stock, (iv) satisfactory evidence that all third-party and governmental consents have been received or sent and not revoked,
(v) satisfactory evidence that all holders of equity of the Company with redemption rights or rights to participate in the issuance of
Series B Preferred Stock and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares, if any, have been waived, (vi) satisfactory
evidence that all persons with the right to receive severance, retention bonuses, stay bonuses, change in control bonuses,
transaction bonuses or other similar payments or arrangements have waived any and all rights to receive such bonuses, (vii) satisfactory
evidence that identified all related party transactions have been terminated, (viii) satisfactory evidence that all employment agreements
have been terminated, (ix) satisfactory evidence that a satisfactory written opinion of the Company s counsel that all of the Series
B Preferred Stock and the securities to be purchased pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated on even date of the Purchase
Agreement, by and among David Elliot Lazar and the Investors are, and the shares of Common Stock underlying the Series B Preferred Stock
will be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, have been issued in compliance with all federal and state securities
laws, and none of such shares was or would be issued in violation of any preemptive rights or similar rights to subscribe for or purchase
securities, (x) the Company s shares be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Nasdaq Global Market, the Nasdaq Global Select
Market, or any successors to any of the foregoing by no later than December 31, 2024, and (xi) the approval from the stockholders
of the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. 

We continue to vigorously dispute the certifications included by Nasdaq in its Form 25 regarding Minim s delisting, as we believe we were not allowed any review and appeal procedures available under the Nasdaq Rules. We also believe that upon closing of the Purchase Agreement we would be in compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule. However, the closing of the investment pursuant to the Purchase Agreement is subject to, inter alia , the Company confirming its continued listing on the Nasdaq by no later than December 31, 2024. 

While we intend to comply with the Nasdaq rules, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain or remain in compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule or other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements on an ongoing and long-term basis, nor that the Nasdaq staff will permit us to present the Purchase Agreement to either the Hearing Panel or the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council, nor that such bodies will grant the Company additional time to achieve compliance by confirming our continued listing on the Nasdaq subject to closing of the Purchase Agreement, nor that we will be successful with our appeal to the SEC. 

If we are unable to satisfy these Nasdaq requirements or standards, and we are not able to close the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, or otherwise successfully petition the SEC to allow us to present to the applicable Nasdaq reviewing body a plan for regaining compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule or other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, we could be subject to final delisting from the Nasdaq, which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so.
