 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Unless otherwise required by the context, in this report, the words EchoStar, the Company, we, our and us refer to EchoStar Corporation and its subsidiaries, DISH Network refers to DISH Network Corporation, our wholly owned subsidiary, and its subsidiaries, and DISH DBS refers to DISH DBS Corporation, a wholly - owned, indirect subsidiary of DISH Network, and its subsidiaries. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, in particular, statements about our plans, objectives and strategies, growth opportunities in our industries and businesses, our expectations regarding future results, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, our estimates regarding the impact of regulatory developments and legal proceedings, and other trends and projections. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts and may be identified by words such as future, anticipate, intend, plan, goal, seek, believe, estimate, expect, predict, will, would, could, can, may, and similar terms. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and represent management s current views and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, events or results and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may be beyond our control. Accordingly, actual performance, events or results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those summarized below: SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to the DIRECTV Transaction We are subject to a number of risks while the DIRECTV Transaction is pending, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to the Integration Although we expect that the Merger will result in synergies and other benefits, those synergies and benefits may not be realized in the amounts anticipated, or may not be realized within the expected timeframe, or at all, and risks associated with the foregoing may also result from any extended delay in the Integration. The market price for shares of our common stock may be affected by factors different from, or in addition to, those that historically affected the market prices of shares of DISH Network Class A Common Stock and EchoStar Class A Common Stock. 
 Competition and Economic Risks We face intense and increasing competition from providers of video, broadband and/or wireless services. Changing consumer behavior and new technologies in our Pay-TV and/or Wireless business may reduce our subscriber activations and may cause our subscribers to purchase fewer services from us or to cancel our services altogether, resulting in less revenue to us. We face certain risks competing in the wireless services industry and operating a facilities-based wireless services business. Our pay-TV competitors may be able to leverage their relationships with programmers to reduce their programming costs and/or offer exclusive content that will place them at a competitive advantage to us. 

 i 

Table of Contents 
 Through the MNSA and the NSA, we depend on T-Mobile and AT T to provide network services to our Wireless subscribers. Our failure to effectively manage these relationships, including without limitation, our minimum commitments, any system failure in their wireless networks, interruption in the services provided to us, and/or the termination of the MNSA or the NSA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We compete with the MNOs whose networks we rely on to provide wireless services to our customers, and they may seek to limit, reduce or terminate our network access to the extent that it becomes competitively advantageous to do so. If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, or at all, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy. 
 Operational and Service Delivery Risks Any deterioration in our operational performance, subscriber activations and churn rate and subscriber satisfaction could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on others to provide the programming that we offer to our Pay-TV subscribers and, if we fail to obtain or lose access to certain programming, our Pay-TV subscriber activations and our subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted. We have limited satellite capacity and any failures or reduced capacity, caused by, among other things, operational and environmental risks, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Extreme weather may result in risk of damage to our infrastructure and therefore our ability to provide services, and may lead to changes in federal, state and foreign government regulation, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business. We depend on independent third parties to solicit orders for our services that represent a meaningful percentage of our total gross new subscriber activations. 
 Risks Related to our Human Capital We rely on highly skilled personnel for our business, and any inability to hire and retain key personnel or to hire qualified personnel may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business growth and customer retention strategies rely in part on the work of technically skilled employees. 
 Risks Related to our Products and Technology Our business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. 

 ii 

Table of Contents 
 We are, and may become, party to various lawsuits which, if adversely decided, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, particularly lawsuits regarding intellectual property. If our products contain defects, we could be subject to significant costs to correct such defects and our product and network service contracts could be delayed or cancelled, which could adversely affect our revenue. 
 Risks Related to Cybersecurity We have experienced and may experience in the future consistent cyber-attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems and any failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure and communications systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations could disrupt or harm our business. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our services and products depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and other enabling systems. 
 Acquisition and Capital Structure Risks We have substantial debt outstanding and may incur additional debt and covenants in our Indentures could limit our ability to undertake certain types of activities and adversely affect our liquidity. We may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, capital expenditures, the development, acquisition and launch of new satellites and other strategic initiatives to complement or expand our business, which may not be successful and we may lose a portion or all of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions. We have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related assets, and may be unable to realize a return on these assets. We may need additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, to fund current obligations, to continue investing in our business and to finance acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We are controlled by one principal stockholder who is our Chairman. 
 Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business Our services depend on FCC licenses that can expire or be revoked or modified and applications for FCC licenses that may not be granted. 
 Other factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the caption Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 10-K filed with the SEC, those discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein and in the 10-K and those discussed in other documents we file with the SEC. All cautionary statements made or referred to herein should be read as being applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear. Investors should consider the risks and uncertainties described or referred to herein and should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

 billion, not including Permitted Transfer Cap receivables of up to billion and certain other amounts of residual capital remaining based on performance. Upon the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction, DISH DBS will become a direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of DTV. The DIRECTV Transaction is subject to a number of terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The completion of the DIRECTV Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, government approval.

Future Capital Requirements The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

 primary business segments: (1) Pay-TV; (2) Retail Wireless; (3) 5G Network Deployment; and (4) Broadband and Satellite Services. Pay-TV We offer pay-TV services under the DISH brand and the SLING brand (collectively Pay-TV services). The DISH branded pay-TV service consists of, among other things, Federal Communications Commission FCC licenses authorizing us to use direct broadcast satellite DBS and Fixed Satellite Service FSS spectrum, our owned and leased satellites, receiver systems, broadcast operations, a leased fiber optic network, in-home service and call center operations and certain other assets utilized in our operations DISH TV ). We also design, develop and distribute receiver systems and provide digital broadcast operations, including satellite uplinking/downlinking, transmission and other services to third-party pay-TV providers. The SLING branded pay-TV services consist of, among other things, multichannel, live-linear and on-demand streaming over-the-top OTT Internet-based domestic, international, Latino and Freestream video programming services SLING TV ). As of September 30, 2024, we had million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States, including million DISH TV subscribers and million SLING TV subscribers. Retail Wireless We offer nationwide prepaid and postpaid retail wireless services to subscribers primarily under our Boost Mobile and Gen Mobile brands Retail Wireless services), as well as a competitive portfolio of wireless devices. Prepaid wireless subscribers generally pay in advance for monthly access to wireless talk, text and data services. Postpaid wireless subscribers are qualified to pay after receiving wireless talk, text and data services, and may also qualify for certain device financing arrangements. We are currently operating our Retail Wireless segment primarily as a mobile virtual network operator MVNO as we continue our 5G Network Deployment and commercialize and grow customer traffic on our 5G Network, as defined below. We are transitioning our Retail Wireless segment to a mobile network operator MNO as our 5G Network has become commercially available and we grow customer traffic on our 5G Network. We are currently activating Boost Mobile subscribers with compatible devices onto our 5G Network in markets where we have reached voice over new radio VoNR . We have deployed 5G VoNR covering over million Americans. Within our MVNO operations, today we depend on T-Mobile and AT T to provide us with network services under the amended Master Network Services Agreement MNSA and Network Services Agreement (the NSA ), respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had million Wireless subscribers. 5G Network Deployment We have invested a total of over billion in Wireless spectrum licenses. The billion of investments related to Wireless spectrum licenses does not include billion of capitalized interest related to the carrying value of such licenses. See Note 2 and Note 10 for further information. We plan to commercialize our Wireless spectrum licenses through the completion of the nation s first cloud-native, Open Radio Access Network O-RAN based 5G network (our 5G Network Deployment ). We have committed to deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network (our 5G Network capable of serving increasingly larger portions of the U.S. population at different deadlines.

 of our nationwide 5G commitments. The single remaining 5G commitment, that at least of the U.S. population has access to average download speeds equal to 35 Mbps, was achieved in March 2024 using the drive test methodology previously agreed upon by us and the FCC and overseen by an independent monitor. We currently have the largest commercial deployment of 5G VoNR in the world covering over million Americans and 5G broadband service covering over million Americans. In September 2024, the FCC conditionally granted our requests to extend the 5G deployment deadlines for certain of our licenses based on several commitments, as detailed in Note 10. We may need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, continue our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate these licenses and related assets and any additional acquired licenses and related assets, as well as to comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such activities, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we continue our 5G Network Deployment, we have and may continue to incur significant additional expenses related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and ongoing upgrades to the wireless network infrastructure, software and third-party integration. As a result of these investments, among other factors, we may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required for our 5G Network Deployment and to compete effectively with other wireless service providers. Broadband and Satellite Services We offer broadband satellite technologies and broadband internet products and services to consumer customers. We provide broadband network technologies, managed services, equipment, hardware, satellite services and communications solutions to government and enterprise customers.

Concurrently with entering into the convertible note hedge transactions, we also entered into warrant transactions with each option counterparty whereby we sold to such option counterparty warrants to purchase, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, up to the same number of shares of DISH Network Class A common stock, which initially gives the option counterparties the option to purchase approximately million shares of DISH Network Class A common stock at a price of approximately per share, which in connection with the completion of the Merger converted into approximately million shares of EchoStar Class A Common Stock at price ranges of approximately to per share. We received million in cash proceeds from the original sale of these warrants. In accordance with accounting guidance on hedge and warrant transactions, the net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions are recorded as a reduction in Additional paid-in capital within Stockholders Equity (Deficit) on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016.

 billion in Wireless spectrum licenses. The billion of investments related to Wireless spectrum licenses does not include billion of capitalized interest related to the carrying value of such licenses. See Note 2 for further information. We plan to commercialize our Wireless spectrum licenses through our 5G Network Deployment. We have committed to deploy our 5G Network capable of serving increasingly larger portions of the U.S. population at different deadlines. We may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms, to fund the efforts described below, as well as, among other things, make any potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment for the AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete all build-out requirements or profitably deploy our Wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations. Wireless Spectrum Licenses Liberty Puerto Rico Asset Sale. On November 5, 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, License Purchase Agreement and other ancillary transaction agreements with Liberty Latin America Liberty and its affiliate providing for the sale of certain of our wireless assets in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands (the Liberty Puerto Rico Asset Sale ). The consideration also includes a right for us to receive preferential international roaming rates within Liberty s footprint at a reduced rate for a 10 year period. The Liberty Puerto Rico Asset Sale was approved by the FCC and DOJ and closed in the third quarter of 2024. We will receive payments totaling million, including working capital adjustments, over a period, including a million upfront payment, which we received in September 2024. We expect to receive the remaining amounts annually over the next s. The Liberty Puerto Rico Asset Sale contains a clawback provision under which we retained the ability to clawback certain wireless licenses. Due to this clawback provision and the associated accounting requirements, we will not derecognize the impacted wireless licenses until the associated contingencies have been resolved. As of September 30, 2024, the contingent liability associated with the clawback provision was million and was recorded in Long-term deferred revenue and other long-term liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The difference between our net carrying value of the assets sold to their fair value resulted in a million gain which was recorded in Other, net within Other Income (Expense) on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 of the population in each license area with respect to these licenses shall be extended to December 14, 2026. The final deadline shall be further extended to June 14, 2028, if: by December 31, 2024, we are offering 5G broadband service to at least of the U.S. population and, as of June 14, 2025 (as defined in our September 2024 FCC extension request): (a) we have offered a low-cost 5G broadband plan and device to consumers nationwide; (b) we have deployed at least 24,000 5G sites; (c) we have upgraded our deployed 5G sites to 3GPP Release 17; and (d) we have provisioned at least of new subscribers with an EchoStar-certified 5G device on our MNO network if the subscriber is within the accelerated markets as set forth in Appendices A-F of our September 2024 FCC extension request. (12) See Note 2 for further information. Commercialization of Our Wireless Spectrum Licenses and Related Assets. On September 29, 2023, the FCC confirmed we have met all of our June 14, 2023 band-specific 5G deployment commitments, and two of our three nationwide 5G commitments. The single remaining 5G commitment, that at least of the U.S. population has access to average download speeds equal to 35 Mbps, was achieved in March 2024 using the drive test methodology previously agreed upon by us and the FCC and overseen by an independent monitor . We currently have the largest commercial deployment of 5G VoNR in the world covering over million Americans and 5G broadband service covering over million Americans. We currently expect capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, for our 5G Network Deployment to be approximately billion, including amounts incurred in 2021, 2022, 2023 and the first nine months of 2024. See Note 2 for further infor mation. In September 2024, the FCC conditionally granted our requests to extend the 5G deployment deadlines for certain of our licenses based on several commitments, described above. We may need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, continue our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate these licenses and related assets and any additional acquired licenses and related assets, as well as to comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such activities, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we continue our 5G Network Deployment, we have and may continue to incur significant additional expenses related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and ongoing upgrades to the wireless network infrastructure, software and third-party integration. As a result of these investments, among other factors, we may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required for our 5G Network Deployment and to compete effectively with other wireless service providers. AWS-3 Auction Northstar Wireless is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northstar Spectrum, which is an entity owned by us and, prior to October 12, 2023, by us and Northstar Manager. SNR Wireless is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SNR HoldCo, which is an entity owned by us and, prior to February 16, 2024, by us and SNR Management. See Note 2 for further information. Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless each filed applications with the FCC to participate in Auction 97 (the AWS-3 Auction for the purpose of acquiring certain AWS-3 Licenses. Each of Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless applied to receive bidding credits of as designated entities under applicable FCC rules.

 bidding credits (approximately billion for Northstar Wireless and billion for SNR Wireless). On November 23, 2020, the FCC released a Memorandum Opinion and Order on Remand, FCC 20-160, that found that Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless are not eligible for bidding credits based on the FCC s determination that they remain under DISH Network s de facto control. Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless appealed the FCC s order to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On June 21, 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an Opinion rejecting this challenge. On January 17, 2023, Northstar Wireless filed a petition for a writ of certiorari asking the United States Supreme Court to hear a further appeal, but that petition was denied on June 30, 2023. Letters Exchanged between Northstar Wireless and the FCC Wireless Bureau. As outlined in letters exchanged between Northstar Wireless and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau of the FCC (the FCC Wireless Bureau ), Northstar Wireless paid the gross winning bid amounts for AWS-3 Licenses and notified the FCC that it would not be paying the gross winning bid amounts for AWS-3 Licenses. As a result of the nonpayment of those gross winning bid amounts, the FCC retained those licenses. If the winning bids from re-auction or other award of the AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC are greater than or equal to the winning bids of Northstar Wireless, no additional amounts will be owed to the FCC by Northstar Wireless. However, if those winning bids are less than the winning bids of Northstar Wireless, then we will be responsible for the difference less any overpayment of the Northstar interim payment, detailed below, (which will be recalculated as of the winning bids from re-auction or other award) (the Northstar Re-Auction Payment ). For example, if the winning bids in a re-auction are 1, the Northstar Re-Auction Payment would be approximately billion, which is calculated as the difference between billion (the Northstar winning bid amounts) and 1 (the winning bids from re-auction) less the resulting million overpayment of the Northstar interim payment. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the timing or outcome of any re-auction or the amount of any Northstar Re-Auction Payment. Letters Exchanged between SNR Wireless and the FCC Wireless Bureau. As outlined in letters exchanged between SNR Wireless and the FCC Wireless Bureau, SNR Wireless paid the gross winning bid amounts for AWS-3 Licenses and notified the FCC that it would not be paying the gross winning bid amounts for AWS-3 Licenses. As a result of the nonpayment of those gross winning bid amounts, the FCC retained those licenses. If the winning bids from re-auction or other award of the AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC are greater than or equal to the winning bids of SNR Wireless, no additional amounts will be owed to the FCC by SNR Wireless. However, if those winning bids are less than the winning bids of SNR Wireless, then we will be responsible for the difference less any overpayment of the SNR interim payment, detailed below, (which will be recalculated as of the winning bids from re-auction or other award) (the SNR Re-Auction Payment ). For example, if the winning bids in a re-auction are 1, the SNR Re-Auction Payment would be approximately billion, which is calculated as the difference between billion (the SNR winning bid amounts) and 1 (the winning bids from re-auction) less the resulting million overpayment of the SNR interim payment. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the timing or outcome of any re-auction or the amount of any SNR Re-Auction Payment.

That verdict became moot on March 21, 2023, when the trial court indicated that it would grant DISH Network L.L.C. s and DISH Technologies L.L.C. s motion for judgment as a matter of law, thus effectively vacating the jury award. On June 2, 2023, the Court entered its formal order granting judgment as a matter of law. On December 12, 2023, the Court denied ClearPlay s motion to alter or amend the judgment. ClearPlay has filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and briefing should be completed by November 27, 2024.

 additional putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, purporting to represent the same nationwide class of people, and Owen-Brooks has filed an amended complaint. On August 2, 2023, the Court issued an order consolidating the first ten cases (the eleventh was dismissed) and, on November 16, 2023 and January 16, 2024, the plaintiffs filed consolidated amended class action complaints. On September 27, 2024, the Court granted DISH Network s motion to dismiss the First Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint as to eight of the eleven named plaintiffs and as to certain causes of action. On October 29, 2024, the Plaintiffs filed the operative Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint, which deletes the allegations as to the dismissed plaintiffs and causes of action, leaving three named plaintiffs and causes of action for negligence, negligence per se, breach of implied contract, and declaratory judgment. We intend to vigorously defend this case. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages. Digital Broadcasting Solutions, LLC On August 29, 2022, Digital Broadcasting Solutions, LLC filed a complaint against our wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges infringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,929,710 (the 710 patent and U.S. Patent No. 9,538,122 (the 122 patent ), each entitled System and method for time shifting at least a portion of a video program. Generally, the plaintiff contends that the AutoHop feature of our Hopper set-top boxes infringes the asserted patents. On June 21, 2023, the Court granted the motion of DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. to have the case transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. In May 2023, DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. filed petitions with the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of all claims of the 710 patent and the 122 patent and, on December 11, 2023, the United States Patent and Trademark Office entered decisions instituting each petition. On May 9, 2024, a magistrate judge issued an order granting the defendants motion to stay the case pending the petitions before the United States Patent and Trademark Office and any related appeals. We intend to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe the asserted patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain features that we currently offer to consumers. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

 -year payment schedule. Under this payment schedule, HCIPL is required to make an annual payment every March 31, through 2031. Following the Supreme Court of India s October 2019 judgment, HCIPL made payments during the first quarter of 2020, and additional payments on each March 31 thereafter. As of September 30, 2024, the gross amount of fees, penalties and interest owed was approximately million with million remaining outstanding as a result of historical payments . Pursuant to the Contribution and Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement dated December 3, 2004 between The DirecTV Group, Inc. DirecTV and certain other entities relating to DirecTV s spinoff of certain of its subsidiaries, including HCIPL, DirecTV undertook to indemnify HCIPL for certain pre-closing tax liabilities. On March 27, 2020, HCIPL filed an indemnification complaint against DirecTV in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking to recover certain license fees, penalties and interest owed to the Indian government as a result of the aforementioned proceedings. On November 16, 2021, the New York court granted summary judgment in favor of DirecTV, but on June 22, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that, under the Purchase Agreement, HCIPL is entitled to indemnification from DirecTV. The Second Circuit remanded the case back to the trial court to determine the amount of indemnification owed. The parties have reached a conditional agreement to settle the matter, and, on October 3, 2024, at the parties request, the Court stayed the case pending the determination of those conditions. Lingam Securities Class Action (formerly Jaramillo) On March 23, 2023, a securities fraud class action complaint was filed against our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network and Messrs. Ergen, Carlson and Orban in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The complaint is brought on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of our securities during the February 22, 2021 to February 27, 2023 class period. In general, the complaint alleges that DISH Network s public statements during that period were false and misleading and contained material omissions, because they did not disclose that DISH Network allegedly maintained a deficient cyber-security and information technology infrastructure, were unable to properly secure customer data and DISH Network s operations were susceptible to widespread service outages. In August 2023, the Court appointed a new lead plaintiff and lead plaintiff s counsel, and, on October 20, 2023, they filed an amended complaint that abandoned the original allegations. In their amended complaint, plaintiffs allege that, during the class period, the defendants concealed problems concerning the 5G network buildout that prevented scaling and commercializing the network to obtain enterprise customers.

Realtime Adaptive Streaming filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit from the exceptionality and fee award orders, and on August 23, 2024, that Court vacated the exceptionality finding and remanded for further consideration of the issue. On October 23, 2024, DISH Network L.L.C., DISH Technologies L.L.C., Sling TV L.L.C. and Sling Media L.L.C. filed a petition with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit seeking rehearing en banc. SafeCast Limited On June 27, 2022, SafeCast Limited filed a complaint against our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges that DISH Network infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,392,302, entitled System for providing improved facilities in time-shifted broadcasts (the 302 patent ). On the same day, it brought complaints in the same court asserting infringement of the same patent against AT T, Google, HBO, NBCUniversal, Paramount and Verizon. On October 24, 2022, in response to the parties joint motion, the Court ordered the case against DISH Network transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. On December 1, 2022, SafeCast filed an amended complaint naming our wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. as defendants and withdrawing the allegations as to DISH Network. The plaintiff is an entity that seeks to license a patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein. On June 22, 2023, DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. filed a petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of the asserted claims of the 302 patent, and on June 26, 2024, the United States Patent and Trademark Office agreed to institute proceedings on that petition. On August 28, 2023, the Court stayed the case pending resolution of the petition. On October 3, 2024, in connection with a third party s petition citing different prior art, the United States Patent and Trademark Office invalidated all claims asserted against DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. but that decision remains subject to a potential appeal. We intend to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe the asserted patent, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain features that we currently offer to consumers. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Rather than opposing the motion, on July 18, 2024, the Trustee filed a first amended complaint, which adds a new declaratory judgment claim challenging certain intercompany advances and new factual allegations challenging a certification of compliance with the DBS Indentures. We intend to vigorously defend this case. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages. Vermont National Telephone Company On September 23, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia unsealed a qui tam complaint that, on May 13, 2015, Vermont National filed against our wholly-owned subsidiaries, DISH Network, American AWS-3 Wireless I L.L.C., American II, American III, and DISH Wireless Holding L.L.C.; Charles W. Ergen (our Chairman) and Cantey M. Ergen (a member of our Board of Directors); Northstar Wireless; Northstar Spectrum; Northstar Manager; SNR Wireless; SNR HoldCo; SNR Management; and certain other parties. The complaint alleges violations of the federal civil False Claims Act (the FCA based on, among other things, allegations that Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless falsely claimed bidding credits of in the AWS-3 Auction when they were allegedly under the de facto control of DISH Network and, therefore, were not entitled to the bidding credits as designated entities under applicable FCC rules. Vermont National participated in the AWS-3 Auction through its wholly-owned subsidiary, VTel Wireless. The complaint was unsealed after the United States Department of Justice notified the District Court that it had declined to intervene in the action. Vermont National seeks to recover on behalf of the United States government approximately billion, which reflects the billion in bidding credits that Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless claimed in the AWS-3 Auction, trebled under the FCA. Vermont National also seeks civil penalties of not less than and not more than for each violation of the FCA. On March 2, 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a stay of the litigation until such time as the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in SNR Wireless LicenseCo, LLC, et al. v. F.C.C. The D.C. Circuit issued its opinion on August 29, 2017 and remanded the matter to the FCC for further proceedings. Thereafter, the District Court maintained the stay until October 26, 2018. On February 11, 2019, the District Court granted Vermont National s unopposed motion for leave to file an amended complaint. On March 28, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss Vermont National s amended complaint, and on March 23, 2021, the District Court granted the motion to dismiss. On April 21, 2021, Vermont National filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and, on May 17, 2022, that court reversed the District Court s dismissal of the complaint. On June 16, 2022, the Defendants-Appellees filed a petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc, but on August 17, 2022, that petition was denied.

 We are currently operating our Retail Wireless segment primarily as a mobile virtual network operator MVNO as we continue our 5G Network Deployment and commercialize and grow customer traffic on our 5G Network, as defined below. We are transitioning our Retail Wireless segment to a mobile network operator MNO as our 5G Network has become commercially available and we grow customer traffic on our 5G Network. We are currently activating Boost Mobile subscribers with compatible devices onto our 5G Network in markets where we have reached voice over new radio VoNR . We have deployed 5G VoNR covering over 200 million Americans. Within our MVNO operations, today we depend on T-Mobile and AT T to provide us with network services under the amended Master Network Services Agreement MNSA and Network Services Agreement (the NSA ), respectively. Our 5G Network Deployment segment strategy is to commercialize our Wireless spectrum licenses through the completion of the nation s first cloud-native, Open Radio Access Network O-RAN based 5G network (our 5G Network Deployment ). We have committed to deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network (our 5G Network capable of serving increasingly larger portions of the U.S. population at different deadlines. On September 29, 2023, the FCC confirmed we have met all of our June 14, 2023 band-specific 5G deployment commitments, and two of our three nationwide 5G commitments. The single remaining 5G commitment, that at least 70 of the U.S. population has access to average download speeds equal to 35 Mbps, was achieved in March 2024 using the drive test methodology previously agreed upon by us and the FCC and overseen by an independent monitor . We currently have the largest commercial deployment of 5G VoNR in th e world covering over 200 million Americans and 5G broadband service covering over 250 million Americans. In September 2024, the FCC conditionally granted our requests to extend the 5G deployment deadlines for certain of our licenses based on several commitments, as detailed in Note 10 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Broadband and Satellite Services segment business strategy is to maintain and improve our leadership position and competitive advantage through development of leading-edge technologies and services marketed to selected sectors within the consumer, enterprise and government markets globally. Within our Broadband and Satellite Services segment we are an industry leader in both networking technologies and services, innovating to deliver the global solutions that power a connected future for people, enterprises and things everywhere. We provide broadband services to consumer customers, which include home and small to medium-sized businesses, and satellite, multi-transport technologies and managed network services to enterprise customers, telecommunications providers, aeronautical service providers and government entities, including civilian and defense. Our EchoStar XXIV satellite began service in December 2023, bringing additional broadband capacity across North and South America and is expected to be an integral part of our satellite service business. We will leverage EchoStar XXIV to deliver satellite services to unserved and underserved consumer markets in the Americas as well as enterprise and government markets. Economic Environment During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, we experienced inflationary pressures in our commodity and labor costs resulting from the macroeconomic environment in the United States, which has significantly impacted our overall operating results.

 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ). EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) attributable to EchoStar plus Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized and net of Interest income, Income tax (provision) benefit, net and Depreciation and amortization. This non-GAAP measure is reconciled to Net income (loss) attributable to EchoStar in our discussion of Results of Operations below. Operating income before depreciation and amortization OIBDA ). OIBDA is defined as Operating income (loss) plus Depreciation and amortization. This non-GAAP measure is reconciled to Operating income (loss) in our discussion of Results of Operations below. DISH TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distribution relationships in our DISH TV subscriber count. We also provide DISH TV services to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by 34.99, and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH TV subscriber count. SLING TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales and third-party marketing agreements in our SLING TV subscriber count. SLING TV subscriber additions are recorded net of disconnects. SLING TV customers receiving SLING TV Freestream service, or service for no charge, under certain new subscriber promotions, are excluded from our SLING TV subscriber count. For customers who subscribe to multiple SLING TV packages, each customer is only counted as one SLING TV subscriber. Pay-TV subscribers. Our Pay-TV subscriber count includes all DISH TV and SLING TV subscribers discussed above. For customers who subscribe to both our DISH TV services and our SLING TV services, each subscription is counted as a separate Pay-TV subscriber. Pay-TV average monthly revenue per subscriber Pay-TV ARPU ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate Pay-TV average monthly revenue per Pay-TV subscriber, or Pay-TV ARPU, by dividing average monthly Pay-TV segment Service revenue, excluding revenue from broadband services, for the period by our average number of Pay-TV subscribers for the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Pay-TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two. SLING TV subscribers on average purchase lower priced programming services than DISH TV subscribers, and therefore, as SLING TV subscribers increase as a percentage of total Pay-TV subscribers, it has had a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU. DISH TV average monthly subscriber churn rate DISH TV churn rate ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate our DISH TV churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH TV subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average number of DISH TV subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of DISH TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two.

 DISH TV SAC. Subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating traditional companies in the pay-TV industry. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the average subscriber acquisition costs per new DISH TV subscriber activation, or DISH TV SAC, and we believe presentations of pay-TV SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. Our DISH TV SAC is calculated using all costs of acquiring DISH TV subscribers (e.g., subsidized equipment, advertising, installation, commissions and direct sales, etc.) which are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses, plus capitalized payments made under certain sales incentive programs and the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers, divided by gross new DISH TV subscriber activations.

Our gross new Wireless subscriber activations exclude all Government subsidized subscribers as we record these subscribers net of disconnects, as discussed below. Government subsidized wireless subscribers and other wireless subscribers Government subsidized subscribers ). Our Government subsidized subscribers have different subscriber economics than our core Wireless subscribers, including a significantly higher churn rate and lower subscriber acquisition costs. Therefore, our Government subsidized subscriber additions are recorded net of disconnects. Our Government subsidized subscriber count includes Wireless subscribers that participate in government subsidized programs, including the ACP program and Lifeline program, defined below, and other subscribers acquired under the Gen Mobile brand. The Affordable Connectivity Program ACP is a federal program offering broadband services and devices discounts to help low-income individuals that meet certain eligibility criteria.

The Lifeline Program is a federal program offering broadband services discounts to help low-income individuals that meet certain eligibility criteria. Certain states also offer a separate Lifeline program. Wireless average monthly revenue per subscriber Wireless ARPU ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate average monthly revenue per Wireless subscriber, or Wireless ARPU, by dividing average monthly Retail Wireless segment Service revenue for the period by our average number of Wireless subscribers for the period. The average number of Wireless subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Wireless subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Wireless subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Wireless subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Wireless average monthly subscriber churn rate Wireless churn rate ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate our Wireless churn rate for any period by dividing the number of Wireless subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average number of Wireless subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Wireless subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Wireless subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Wireless subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Wireless subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Government subsidized subscriber additions are recorded net of disconnects and therefore excluded from our calculation of our Wireless churn rate.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Segments Business Segments We currently operate four primary business segments: (1) Pay-TV; (2) Retail Wireless; (3) 5G Network Deployment; and (4) Broadband and Satellite Services. Revenue and operating income (loss) by segment are shown in the table below: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023. 

For the Three Months Ended September 30, Variance 2024 2023 Amount (In thousands) Revenue: Pay-TV 2,618,031 2,807,101 (189,070) (6.7) Retail Wireless 895,949 890,980 4,969 0.6 5G Network Deployment 43,227 29,916 13,311 44.5 Broadband and Satellite Services 386,709 413,073 (26,364) (6.4) Eliminations (52,932) (32,196) (20,736) (64.4) Total revenue 3,890,984 4,108,874 (217,890) (5.3) Operating income (loss): Pay-TV 588,501 589,465 (964) (0.2) Retail Wireless (113,792) (168,166) 54,374 32.3 5G Network Deployment (600,270) (463,105) (137,165) (29.6) Broadband and Satellite Services (36,116) 9,991 (46,107) Eliminations 910 466 444 95.3 Total operating income (loss) (160,767) (31,349) (129,418) 

 Percentage is not meaningful Total revenue. Our consolidated revenue totaled 3.891 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 218 million or 5.3 compared to the same period in 2023. The net decrease primarily resulted from the decrease in revenue from our Pay-TV and Broadband and Satellite Services segments. Total operating income (loss). Our consolidated operating loss totaled 161 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase in operating loss of 129 million compared to the same period in 2023. This change primarily resulted from an increase in operating loss from our 5G Network Deployment segment and an operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to operating income during the same period in 2023 from our Broadband and Satellite Services segment, partially offset by a decrease in operating loss from our Retail Wireless segment.

Our consolidated revenue totaled 11.859 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 994 million or 7.7 compared to the same period in 2023. The net decrease primarily resulted from the decrease in revenue from our Pay-TV, Broadband and Satellite Services and Retail Wireless segments. Total operating income (loss). Our consolidated operating loss totaled 241 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to operating income of 574 million during the same period in 2023. This change primarily resulted from an increase in operating loss from our 5G Network Deployment and Retail Wireless segments, a decrease in operating income from our Pay-TV segment, and an operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to operating income during the same period in 2023 from our Broadband and Satellite Services segment.

 Pay-TV Segment We offer Pay-TV services under the DISH brand and the SLING brand. As of September 30, 2024, we had 8.031 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States, including 5.888 million DISH TV subscribers and 2.143 million SLING TV subscribers. We promote our Pay-TV services by providing our subscribers with better service, technology and value than those available from other subscription television service providers. We offer a wide selection of video services under the DISH TV brand, with access to hundreds of channels depending on the level of subscription. Our standard programming packages generally include programming provided by national cable networks. We also offer programming packages that include local broadcast networks, specialty sports channels, premium movie channels and Latino and international programming. We market our SLING TV services to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services, as well as to current and recent traditional pay-TV subscribers who desire a lower cost alternative. Our SLING TV services require an Internet connection and are available on multiple streaming-capable devices including, among others, streaming media devices, TVs, tablets, computers, game consoles and phones. We offer SLING domestic, SLING International, SLING Latino and SLING Freestream video programming services. Trends in our Pay-TV Segment Competition Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured. We and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. We face substantial competition from established pay-TV providers and broadband service providers and increasing competition from companies providing/facilitating the delivery of video content via the Internet to computers, televisions, and other streaming and mobile devices, including wireless service providers. In recent years, industry consolidation and convergence has created competitors with greater scale and multiple product/service offerings. These developments, among others, have contributed to intense and increasing competition, and we expect such competition to continue. We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH TV subscribers, generally as a result of upgrading their equipment to next generation receivers, primarily including our Hopper receivers, and by providing retention credits. Our DISH TV subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period. Many of our competitors have been especially aggressive by offering discounted programming and services for both new and existing subscribers, including, but not limited to, bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other promotional offers. Certain competitors have been able to subsidize the price of video services with the price of broadband and/or wireless services. Our Pay-TV services also face increased competition from programmers and other companies who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet, as well as traditional satellite television providers, cable companies and large telecommunications companies that are rapidly increasing their Internet-based video offerings and direct-to-consumer exclusive and non-exclusive content. We also face competition from providers of video content, many of which are providers of programming content to us, that distribute content over the Internet including services with live-linear television programming, as well as single programmer offerings and offerings of large libraries of on-demand content, including in certain cases original content. These product offerings include, but are not limited to, Netflix, Hulu, Apple+, Prime Video, YouTube TV, Disney+, ESPN+, Paramount+, Max, STARZ, Peacock, Fubo, Philo and Tubi and certain bundles of these offerings.

 Significant changes in consumer behavior regarding the means by which consumers obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. In particular, consumers have shown increased interest in viewing certain video programming in any place, at any time and/or on any broadband or Internet-connected device they choose. Online content providers may cause our subscribers to disconnect our DISH TV services cord cutting ), downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages cord shaving or elect to purchase through these online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us. Mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances among cable television providers, telecommunications companies, programming providers and others may result in, among other things, greater scale and financial leverage and increase the availability of offerings from providers capable of bundling video, broadband and/or wireless services in competition with our services and may exacerbate the risks described under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere in our public filings. These transactions may affect us adversely by, among other things, making it more difficult for us to obtain access to certain programming networks on nondiscriminatory and fair terms, or at all. Our Pay-TV subscriber base has been declining due to, among other things, the factors described above. There can be no assurance that our Pay-TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. As our Pay-TV subscriber base continues to decline, it could have a material adverse long-term effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Programming Our ability to compete successfully will depend, among other things, on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices. Programming costs represent a large percentage of our Cost of services and the largest component of our total expense. We expect these costs to continue to increase due to contractual price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms and certain programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation. In particular, the rates we are charged for retransmitting local broadcast channels have been increasing substantially and may exceed our ability to increase our prices to our subscribers. Our ability to provide services under these agreements and negotiate acceptable terms depends on, among other things, the number of subscribers we have, our actual, perceived or anticipated financial condition and our negotiating power against each programmer, which can vary depending on the size and scale of such programmer. Going forward, our margins may face pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on acceptable pricing and other economic terms or if we are unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our subscribers. Increases in programming costs have caused us to increase the rates that we charge to our subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing Pay-TV subscribers to disconnect our services or cause potential new Pay-TV subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our services. Additionally, even if our subscribers do not disconnect our services, they may purchase through new and existing online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us.

 Furthermore, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew our long-term programming carriage contracts. In the past, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. There can be no assurance that the removal of any channels will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses. Other Developments Adaptive Bitrate Streaming Patents Through our subsidiaries, we hold dozens of issued United States and foreign patents that relate to Adaptive Bitrate Streaming. On September 9, 2022, the chief administrative law judge at the United States International Trade Commission ITC issued an Initial Determination holding that the video streaming in certain Peloton, NordicTrack and Mirror exercise equipment infringes four of those patents, and recommended that the ITC prevent the importation of the infringing products. On March 8, 2023, the ITC issued its Final Determination, which affirmed the Initial Determination for three of the four patents in all material aspects, and issued the recommended exclusion and cease and desist orders, which will become effective after a Presidential review period. On February 9, 2023, we entered into a confidential license agreement covering Mirror exercise equipment that resolves our litigation involving those products. On May 1, 2023, we entered into a 75 million license agreement covering Peloton exercise equipment that resolves our litigation involving those products. During the second quarter of 2023, we recorded the 75 million license agreement in Equipment sales and other revenue on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). On March 6, 2024, we entered into a license agreement covering NordicTrack exercise equipment that resolves our litigation involving those products and received the initial payment.

(1) Purchases of property and equipment, net of refunds includes satellite purchases during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 29 million and 27 million, respectively. Pay-TV Subscribers DISH TV subscribers . We lost approximately 188,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the loss of approximately 181,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2023. This increase in net DISH TV subscriber losses primarily resulted from lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, partially offset by a lower DISH TV churn rate. 

 74 

Table of Contents Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 
 SLING TV subscribers . We added approximately 145,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the addition of approximately 117,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the same period in 2023. The change in net SLING TV subscribers was primarily related to higher SLING TV subscriber activations and lower SLING TV subscriber disconnects in 2024 due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. We continue to experience increased competition, including competition from other subscription video on-demand and live-linear OTT service providers, many of which are providers of our content and offer football and other seasonal sports programming direct to subscribers on an a la carte basis. DISH TV subscribers, gross . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we activated approximately 75,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers compared to approximately 142,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 47.2 . This decrease in our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations was primarily related to the lack of demand, shifting consumer behavior and lower marketing expenditures, as well as increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive short term introductory pricing and bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, and direct-to-consumer offerings by certain of our programmers. Our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations continue to be negatively impacted by an emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. DISH TV churn rate . Our DISH TV churn rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.47 compared to 1.58 for the same period in 2023. Our DISH TV churn rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by our emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers. Our DISH TV churn rate continues to be adversely impacted by external factors, such as, among other things, cord cutting, shifting consumer behavior and increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. Our DISH TV churn rate is also impacted by internal factors, such as, among other things, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud and the level of our retention efforts. Our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and DISH TV subscriber churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses. We have not always met our own standards for performing high-quality installations, effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise, answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe, effectively communicating with our subscriber base, reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business, improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment and aligning the interests of certain independent third-party retailers and installers to provide high-quality service. Most of these factors have affected both gross new DISH TV subscriber activations as well as DISH TV subscriber churn rate. Our future gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and our DISH TV subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted by these factors, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue. Service revenue. Service revenue totaled 2.602 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 175 million or 6.3 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Service revenue compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to lower average Pay-TV subscriber base, partially offset by an increase in Pay-TV ARPU, discussed below. 

 75 

Table of Contents Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 
 Pay-TV ARPU. Pay-TV ARPU was 108.88 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 105.25 during the same period in 2023. The 3.63 or 3.4 increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH TV and SLING TV programming price increases and higher Pay-TV ad sales revenue. The DISH TV and SLING TV programming package price increases were effective in the fourth quarter of 2023. Cost of services. Cost of services totaled 1.639 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 77 million or 4.5 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Cost of services was primarily attributable to a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base, partially offset by higher programming costs per subscriber. Programming costs per subscriber increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels. Cost of services represented 63.0 and 61.8 of Service revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are generally contingent on the number of Pay-TV subscribers to whom we provide the respective content. Our Cost of services have and will continue to face further upward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. In addition, our programming expenses will increase to the extent we are successful in growing our Pay-TV subscriber base. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 284 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 102 million or 26.4 decrease compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in subscriber acquisition costs resulting from lower marketing expenditures and lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a decrease in personnel costs. In addition, the three months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by Merger related costs. DISH TV SAC. DISH TV SAC was 985 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,065 during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 80 or 7.5 . This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in advertising costs per subscriber and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts, partially offset by higher commission costs due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers totaled 6 million and 16 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulted from a decrease in gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts. To remain competitive, we upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the costs associated with these upgrades may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and consequently would realize less benefit from the DISH TV SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Our DISH TV SAC may materially increase in the future to the extent that we, among other things, transition to newer technologies, introduce more aggressive promotions, or provide greater equipment subsidies.

We added approximately 88,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the loss of approximately 214,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the same period in 2023. The change in net SLING TV subscribers was primarily related to lower SLING TV subscriber disconnects in 2024 due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers, partially offset by lower SLING TV subscriber activations.

This decrease in our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations was primarily related to the lack of demand, shifting consumer behavior and lower marketing expenditures, as well as increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive short term introductory pricing and bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, and direct-to-consumer offerings by certain of our programmers.

Our DISH TV churn rate continues to be adversely impacted by external factors, such as, among other things, cord cutting, shifting consumer behavior and increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. Our DISH TV churn rate is also impacted by internal factors, such as, among other things, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud and the level of our retention efforts. In addition, our DISH TV churn rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was briefly elevated due to the cyber-security incident in the first quarter of 2023. Our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV subscriber churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses. Service revenue. Service revenue totaled 7.962 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 630 million or 7.3 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Service revenue compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to lower average Pay-TV subscriber base, partially offset by an increase in Pay-TV ARPU, discussed below. Equipment sales and other revenue. Equipment sales and other revenue totaled 59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 103 million compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Equipment sales and other revenue compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to a non-recurring 75 million license of our Adaptive Bitrate Streaming patents to Peloton covering certain Peloton products that resolves our litigation involving those products during the second quarter of 2023 .

 Pay-TV ARPU. Pay-TV ARPU was 108.21 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 103.98 during the same period in 2023. The 4.23 or 4.1 increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH TV and SLING TV programming price increases and higher Pay-TV ad sales revenue. The DISH TV and SLING TV programming package price increases were effective in the fourth quarter of 2023. Cost of services. Cost of services totaled 4.942 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 356 million or 6.7 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Cost of services was primarily attributable to a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base and lower variable and retention costs per subscriber, partially offset by higher programming costs per subscriber. Programming costs per subscriber increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels. Variable and retention costs per subscriber during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were negatively impacted by approximately 30 million in cyber-security-related expenses to remediate the incident and provide additional customer support. Cost of services represented 62.1 and 61.7 of Service revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 840 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 269 million or 24.2 decrease compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in subscriber acquisition costs resulting from lower marketing expenditures and lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a decrease in personnel costs. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by Merger related costs. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled 258 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , a 28 million or 9.8 decrease compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation expense from equipment leased to new and existing DISH TV subscribers and the EchoStar XI satellite which became fully depreciated during the second quarter of 2023. DISH TV SAC. DISH TV SAC was 993 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,095 during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 102 or 9.3 . This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in advertising costs per subscriber and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts, partially offset by higher commission costs due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers totaled 19 million and 43 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulted from a decrease in gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts.

 Retail Wireless Segment We offer nationwide prepaid and postpaid Retail Wireless services to subscribers primarily under our Boost Mobile and Gen Mobile brands, as well as a competitive portfolio of wireless devices. Prepaid wireless subscribers generally pay in advance for monthly access to wireless talk, text and data services. Postpaid wireless subscribers are qualified to pay after receiving wireless talk, text and data services, and may also qualify for certain device financing arrangements. Boost Mobile postpaid . During 2023, we launched our nationwide expansion of our Boost Mobile postpaid wireless service. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, we began offering premium wireless devices, including Apple products. We currently offer a broad range of premium wireless devices on our 5G Network. We are currently operating our Retail Wireless segment primarily as an MVNO as we continue our 5G Network Deployment and commercialize and grow customer traffic on our 5G Network. We are transitioning our Retail Wireless segment to an MNO as our 5G Network has become commercially available and we grow customer traffic on our 5G Network. We are currently activating Boost Mobile subscribers with compatible devices onto our 5G Network in markets where we have reached VoNR . We have deployed 5G VoNR covering over 200 million Americans. Within our MVNO operations, today we depend on T-Mobile and AT T to provide us with network services under the MNSA and NSA, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 we had 6.984 million Wireless subscribers. Currently, we offer Wireless subscribers competitive consumer plans with no annual service contracts and monthly service plans including high-speed data and unlimited talk and text, and device financing arrangements for certain qualified subscribers. During the second half of 2022, we began the process of migrating subscribers off the Transition Services Agreement TSA with T-Mobile, including the billing systems, and onto our own billing and operational support systems. The migration of subscribers to our new billing and operational support systems accelerated during the fourth quarter of 2022 and continued in the first and second quarters of 2023. The migration of subscribers during the first and second quarters of 2023 negatively impacted our Wireless churn rate and our results of operations. During the second quarter of 2023, we completed the migration of subscribers off the TSA with T-Mobile and onto our own billing and operational support systems. ACP Subscribers. A portion of our Wireless subscriber base and revenue is comprised of subscribers who received benefits under ACP through May 2024. Households enrolled in the ACP program continued to receive the benefit on their service through April 2024. In May 2024, households received a partial benefit and on June 1, 2024 the ACP program funding concluded and households no longer received their benefit. Although we implemented plans to retain and/or migrate these subscribers to lower priced service plans, these subscribers began deactivating in the second and third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 33,000 Wireless ACP subscribers, and if we are unsuccessful in retaining and/or migrating the remaining subscribers, they will deactivate in the fourth quarter of 2024. Generally, ACP subscribers have lower Wireless ARPU than other Wireless subscribers and as a result, any loss of ACP subscribers will have a nominal impact on pre-tax net income. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact of the loss of the ACP benefit to our Wireless subscriber base, net Wireless subscriber activations and results of operations.

 5G Network Deployment Segment We have invested a total of over 30 billion in Wireless spectrum licenses. The 30 billion of investments related to Wireless spectrum licenses does not include 9 billion of capitalized interest related to the carrying value of such licenses. See Note 2 and Note 10 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We plan to commercialize our Wireless spectrum licenses through our 5G Network Deployment. We have committed to deploy our 5G Network capable of serving increasingly larger portions of the U.S. population at different deadlines. We may need to raise additional capital in the future , which may not be available on favorable terms, to fund the efforts described below, as well as, among other things, make any potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment for the AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete all build-out requirements or profitably deploy our Wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations. See Note 10 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Our Wireless spectrum licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements, as well as certain renewal requirements. On September 29, 2023, the FCC confirmed we have met all of our June 14, 2023 band-specific 5G deployment commitments, and two of our three nationwide 5G commitments. The single remaining 5G commitment, that at least 70 of the U.S. population has access to average download speeds equal to 35 Mbps, was achieved in March 2024 using the drive test methodology previously agreed upon by us and the FCC and overseen by an independent monitor . We currently have the largest commercial deployment of 5G VoNR in the world covering over 200 million Americans and 5G broadband service covering over 250 million Amer icans. In September 2024, the FCC conditionally granted our requests to extend the 5G deployment deadlines for certain of our licenses based on several commitments, as detailed in Note 10 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We may need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, continue our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate these licenses and related assets and any additional acquired licenses and related assets, as well as to comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such activities, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we continue our 5G Network Deployment, we have and may continue to incur significant additional expenses related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and ongoing upgrades to the wireless network infrastructure, software and third-party integration. As a result of these investments, among other factors, we may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required for our 5G Network Deployment and to compete effectively with other wireless service providers.

 Broadband and Satellite Services Segment We are an industry leader in both networking technologies and services, innovating to deliver the global solutions that power a connected future for people, enterprises and things everywhere. We provide broadband services to consumer customers, which include home and small to medium-sized businesses, and satellite, multi-transport technologies and managed network services to enterprise customers, telecommunications providers, aeronautical service providers and government entities, including civilian and defense. Our EchoStar XXIV satellite began service in December 2023, bringing additional broadband capacity across North and South America and is expected to be an integral part of our satellite service business. We will leverage EchoStar XXIV to deliver satellite services to unserved and underserved consumer markets in the Americas as well as enterprise and government markets. We also design, provide and install gateway and terminal equipment to customers for other satellite systems. In addition, we design, develop, construct and provide telecommunication networks comprising satellite ground segment systems and terminals to mobile system operators and our enterprise customers. We also offer a robust suite of integrated, multi-transport solutions to enable airline and airline service providers to deliver reliable in-flight network connectivity serving both commercial and business aviation. Backlog As of September 30, 2024, our Broadband and Satellite services segment had approximately 1.521 billion of contracted revenue backlog. We define the Broadband and Satellite services segment contracted revenue backlog as our expected future revenue under enterprise customer contracts that are non-cancelable, including lease revenue. Competition Our industry is highly competitive. As a global provider of network technologies, products and services, our Broadband and Satellite Services Segment competes with a large number of telecommunications service providers, which puts pressure on prices and margins. To compete effectively, we emphasize our network quality, customization capability, offering of networks as a turnkey managed service, position as a single point of contact for products and services and competitive prices. In our consumer broadband satellite technologies and internet services markets, we compete against traditional telecommunications and wireless carriers, other satellite internet providers, as well as fiber optic, cable and wireless internet service providers. Customers consider cost, speed and accessibility to be key determining factors in the selection of a service provider. In addition, government subsidies, such as the Federal Communications Commission s FCC Rural Development Opportunity Fund, can have the effect of subsidizing the growth of our wired, wireless and satellite competitors. Our primary satellite competitors in the North American consumer market are ViaSat Communications, Inc., which is owned by ViaSat, Inc. ViaSat and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. SpaceX ). Both ViaSat and SpaceX have also entered the South and Central American consumer markets. We seek to differentiate ourselves based on the ubiquitous availability of our service, quality, proprietary technology and distribution channels.

 Non-GAAP Performance Measures and Reconciliation It is management s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of our GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. Consolidated EBITDA Consolidated EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Consolidated EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it is a helpful measure for those evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 Segment OIBDA Segment OIBDA, which is presented below, is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability of our business segments on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions for those business segments, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment OIBDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to business segments operating income (loss). See Note 11 to the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash, Cash Equivalents, Current Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Investment Securities We consider all liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. See Note 5 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our current restricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. As of September 30, 2024 cash, cash equivalents, current restricted cash and cash equivalents, and current marketable investment securities totaled 2.722 billion compared to 2.444 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 278 million. This increase in cash, cash equivalents, current restricted cash and cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities primarily resulted from 2.364 billion in net proceeds from the New DISH DBS Financing and cash generated from operating activities of 1.207 billion, partially offset by capital expenditures, net of refunds, of 1.844 billion (including capitalized interest related to Regulatory authorizations), the redemption of our 2 3/8 Convertible Notes due 2024 of 951 million and the purchase of SNR Management s ownership interest in SNR HoldCo of 442 million. Cash Flow The following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash flows from operating activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported Net cash flows from operating activities of 1.207 billion primarily attributable to 1.020 billion of Net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the non-cash items for Depreciation and amortization expense, Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments, impairments and other, Liberty Puerto Rico Asset Sale losses (gains), Non-cash, stock-based compensation expense, Deferred tax expense (benefit), and Equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates. In addition, Net cash flows from operating activities was impacted by the timing difference between book expense and cash payments, including income taxes, and other working capital changes. Cash flows from investing activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported outflows from Net cash flows from investing activities of 1.177 billion primarily related to capital expenditures, net of refunds, of 1.844 billion (including capitalized interest related to Regulatory authorizations), partially offset by 534 million in net sales of marketable investment securities and 95 million in proceeds from the Liberty Puerto Rico asset sale. Cash flows from financing activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported inflows from Net cash flows from financing activities of 870 million primarily related to 2.364 billion in net proceeds from the New DISH DBS Financing, partially offset by the redemption of our 2 3/8 Convertible Notes due 2024 of 951 million, the purchase of SNR Management s ownership interest in SNR HoldCo of 442 million and repayments of long-term debt, finance lease and other obligations of 101 million.

 Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less: (i) Purchases of property and equipment net of Refunds and other receipts of purchases of property and equipment, and (ii) Capitalized interest related to Regulatory authorizations, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments (including strategic wireless investments), fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. Free cash flow can be significantly impacted from period to period by changes in Net income (loss) adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges, operating assets and liabilities, Purchases of property and equipment, net of Refunds and other receipts of purchases of property and equipment, and Capitalized interest related to Regulatory authorizations. These items are shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities and Net cash flows from investing activities sections on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, management s timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber additions (losses), service revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition and retention costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs for DISH TV subscribers, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment, expenditures related to our 5G Network Deployment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net cash flows from operating activities 1,207,144 2,021,550 Purchases of property and equipment, net of refunds (including capitalized interest related to Regulatory authorizations) (1,843,595) (3,246,877) Free cash flow (636,451) (1,225,327) Operational Liquidity We make general investments in property such as, among others, satellites, wireless devices, set-top boxes, information technology and facilities that support our Pay-TV, Retail Wireless and Broadband and Satellite Services segments. We are also making significant additional investments and may partner with others to, among other things, continue our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate our Wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. Moreover, since we are primarily a subscriber-based company, we also make subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers. While the general investments may be deferred without impacting the business in the short-term, the subscriber-specific investments are less discretionary. Our overall objective is to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of each subscriber to provide an adequate return against the upfront investment. Once the upfront investment has been made for each subscriber, the subsequent cash flow is generally positive, but there can be no assurance that over time we will recoup or earn a return on the upfront investment. 

 104 

Table of Contents Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 
 There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at a given point in time. The first factor is our churn rate and how successful we are at retaining our current subscribers. To the extent we lose subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced. The second factor is how successful we are at maintaining our service margins. To the extent our Cost of services grow faster than our Service revenue, the amount of cash flow that is generated per existing subscriber is reduced. Our Pay-TV service margins have been reduced by, among other things, higher programming costs. Our Retail Wireless service margins are impacted by, among other things, our MNSA agreement with T-Mobile and our NSA agreement with AT T and the speed with which we are able to migrate Wireless subscribers onto our 5G Network. The third factor is the rate at which we acquire new subscribers. The faster we acquire new subscribers, the more our positive ongoing cash flow from existing subscribers is offset by the negative upfront cash flow associated with acquiring new subscribers. Conversely, the slower we acquire subscribers, the more our operating cash flow is enhanced in that period. Finally, our future cash flow is impacted by, among other things, the rate at which we complete our 5G Network Deployment, incur litigation expense, and any cash flow from financing activities. We anticipate operating expenditures for our 5G Network Deployment to increase for the remainder of 2024 as we continue to, among other things, deploy cell sites and communication towers to continue to commercialize our 5G Network. We expect our capital expenditures to remain consistent in the near term. However, as we prepare for our next build-out requirement deadlines, we expect our capital expenditures to increase as we approach these deadlines. As a result, our historical cash flow is not necessarily indicative of our future cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, as a result of, among other things, capital expenditures for our 5G Network Deployment, we experienced negative free cash flow. We expect that this trend will continue in 2024 and in future periods. In addition, declines in our Pay-TV and Wireless subscriber base and any decrease in subscriber-related margins negatively impact our cash flow, and there can be no assurance that our subscriber declines will not continue. Subscriber Base Pay TV, Retail Wireless and Broadband and Satellite Services Segments See Results of Operations above for further information. Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs We incur significant upfront costs to acquire Pay-TV, Wireless and Broadband subscribers, including, but not limited to, advertising, independent third-party retailer incentives, payments made to third parties, equipment and wireless device subsidies, installation services and/or new customer promotions. While we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscription, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that objective. With respect to our DISH TV services and Boost Mobile postpaid, we employ business rules such as minimum credit requirements for prospective customers and contractual commitments. We strive to provide outstanding customer service to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their Pay-TV services and Boost Mobile postpaid service over longer periods of time. Subscriber acquisition costs for SLING TV subscribers are significantly lower than those for DISH TV subscribers. Our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period. We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH TV subscribers, generally as a result of upgrading their equipment to next generation receivers, primarily including our Hopper receivers, and by providing retention credits. As with our subscriber acquisition costs, our retention upgrade spending includes the cost of equipment and installation services. In certain circumstances, we also offer programming at no additional charge and/or promotional pricing for limited periods to existing customers in exchange for a contractual commitment to receive service for a minimum term. A component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move. Retention costs for Wireless subscribers are primarily related to promotional pricing on upgraded wireless devices for qualified existing subscribers. Our DISH TV and Wireless subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period.

 Seasonality Historically, the first half of the year generally produces fewer gross new DISH TV subscriber activations than the second half of the year, as is typical in the pay-TV industry. In addition, the first and fourth quarters generally produce a lower DISH TV churn rate than the second and third quarters. However, in recent years, as the pay-TV industry has matured, we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. As a result, historical trends in seasonality described above may not be indicative of future trends. Our net SLING TV subscriber additions are impacted by, among other things, certain major sporting events and other major television events. The first and third quarters generally produce higher gross new Wireless subscriber activations. The historical trends discussed above, for net DISH TV subscriber additions, net SLING TV subscriber additions and gross new Wireless subscriber activations, may not be indicative of future trends. There can be no assurance that these trends will not continue and/or accelerate. Satellites Pay-TV Segment. Operation of our DISH TV services requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming that we offer. Moreover, competitive conditions may require that we expand our offering of new programming. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and cause us to expend a significant portion of our cash to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity. Broadband and Satellite Services Segment. Operation of our Broadband and Satellite Services also requires adequate satellite transmission capacity for the services that we offer. Prior to the launch of EchoStar XXIV, we were nearing or had reached capacity in most areas of the U.S., which constrained growth within our consumer subscriber base. These constraints have been addressed by the EchoStar XXIV satellite. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of services. Covenants and Restrictions Related to our Long-Term Debt We are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures related to our long-term debt. DISH Network and DISH DBS Corporation The indentures related to our outstanding senior notes issued by DISH DBS Corporation DISH DBS contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on the ability of DISH DBS and its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions on DISH DBS capital stock or repurchase DISH DBS capital stock; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with another company; and (viii) transfer or sell assets. 

 106 

Table of Contents Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 
 The indentures related to our outstanding DISH Network and DISH DBS senior secured notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on our ability and certain of our subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock; (iv) make certain investments of spectrum collateral; (v) create liens; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with another company; and (viii) transfer or sell assets. Should we fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of the debt under the senior notes, senior secured notes and our other long-term debt could become immediately payable. The senior notes and senior secured notes also provide that the debt may be required to be prepaid if certain change-in-control events occur. In addition, the Convertible Notes provide that, if a fundamental change (as defined in the related indenture) occurs, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes. As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we, DISH Network and DISH DBS were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions related to our respective long-term debt recorded on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation The indentures related to our outstanding senior notes issued by Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation HSSC contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on the ability of HSSC and its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make distributions on HSSC s capital stock or repurchase HSSC s capital stock; (iii) allow to exist certain restrictions on such subsidiaries ability to pay dividends, make distributions, make other payments, or transfer assets; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with another company; and (viii) transfer or sell assets. As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we and HSSC were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions related to our respective long-term debt recorded on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. Other We are also vulnerable to fraud, particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers. While we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions, there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud, which could impact our subscriber growth and churn. Economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft, piracy and subscriber fraud, which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual Obligations See Note 10 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Future Capital Requirements We expect to fund our future working capital, capital expenditures, other investments, and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations, existing cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities balances, and cash generated through raising additional capital. We may need to make significant additional investments to, among other things, continue our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate our Wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. The amount of capital required to fund our future working capital, capital expenditure and other investment needs varies, depending on, among other things, the rate at which we complete our 5G Network Deployment, the potential purchase of additional wireless spectrum licenses and the rate at which we acquire new subscribers, and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention. 

 107 

Table of Contents Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 
 Certain of our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be driven by the rate of our 5G Network Deployment as well as costs associated with subscriber premises equipment. These expenditures are necessary for our 5G Network Deployment as well as to operate and maintain our DISH TV services. Consequently, we consider them to be non-discretionary. Our capital expenditures vary depending on, among other things, the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time and could increase materially as a result of increased competition, significant satellite failures, or economic weakness and uncertainty. Our DISH TV subscriber base has been declining and there can be no assurance that our DISH TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. In the event that our DISH TV subscriber base continues to decline, it will have a material adverse long-term effect on our cash flow. We have and expect to continue to incur expenditures in 2024 related to our 5G Network Deployment, including, but not limited to, capital expenditures associated with our 5G Network Deployment and the potential purchase of additional wireless spectrum licenses. The amount of capital required will also depend on, among other things, our available liquidity, the growth of our Retail Wireless segment and the levels of investment necessary to support potential strategic initiatives that may arise from time to time. These factors, including, but not limited to, a reduction in our available future cash flows as a result of our 5G Network Deployment, may require us to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms. Volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high-yield indebtedness, such as us, to access capital markets at favorable terms. These developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position. Wireless 5G Network Deployment See Note 10 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Availability of Credit and Effect on Liquidity The ability to raise capital has generally existed for us despite economic weakness and uncertainty. While modest fluctuations in the cost of capital will not likely impact our current operational plans, significant fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Debt Issuances and Maturity We repurchased or redeemed the principal balance of our 2 3/8 Convertible Notes due 2024 as of March 15, 2024, the instrument s maturity date. Our 5 7/8 Senior Notes due 2024 with remaining balance of approximately 1.983 billion mature on November 15, 2024. We expect to fund this obligation from our current restricted cash and cash equivalents balances on hand. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors. The information presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Risks Relating to the DIRECTV Transaction Termination of the Purchase Agreement or failure to otherwise complete the DIRECTV Transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Termination of the Purchase Agreement or any failure to otherwise complete the DIRECTV Transaction may result in various adverse consequences, including: our not being able to realize the anticipated benefits of the DIRECTV Transaction ; our business being materially adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the DIRECTV Transaction, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the DIRECTV Transaction; and
 negative reactions from the financial markets, respective customers and other stakeholders possibly related to the above. If any of the foregoing consequences were to occur as a result of termination of the Purchase Agreement, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 The timing of the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction is not certain, and is subject to certain conditions, some of which we cannot control, which could result in the DIRECTV Transaction not being completed or being completed later than we expect, which could have a material adverse impact on our costs and revenues or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the DIRECTV Transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including, for example, the satisfaction of certain antitrust and other regulatory approvals and the successful exchange of DISH DBS Notes, none of which have been satisfied, and the absence of legal restraints prohibiting the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. Governmental agencies may not approve the DIRECTV Transaction or may impose conditions to any such approval or require changes to the terms of the DIRECTV Transaction. Any such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the DIRECTV Transaction, imposing costs on or limiting our revenues or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the DIRECTV Transaction. Furthermore, under the Purchase Agreement, each party s obligation to consummate the DIRECTV Transaction is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to certain qualifications and exceptions) and the performance in all material respects of the other party s covenants under the Purchase Agreement, including, with respect to us, certain covenants regarding the operation of our business prior to completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. As a result of these conditions, we cannot provide assurance that the DIRECTV Transaction will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. If such conditions are not fulfilled by the Outside Date or, if for any other reason, the DIRECTV Transaction is not completed on or prior to the Outside Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), the Purchase Agreement may be terminated and the DIRECTV Transaction may not be completed. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the required governmental and regulatory approvals to complete the DIRECTV Transaction, which, if delayed or not granted, is likely to delay or jeopardize the DIRECTV Transaction . The DIRECTV Transaction is conditioned on the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission FCC and possibly the consent of certain other merger control authorities and other governmental entities as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (collectively, Regulatory Approval ). These governmental and regulatory agencies have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations. As a condition to their approval of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, those agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business. The required approvals may not be obtained or the required conditions to the DIRECTV Transaction may not be satisfied, or, even if the required approvals are obtained and the conditions to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction are satisfied, the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals are uncertain. Any delay in completing the DIRECTV Transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Table of Contents 
 The DIRECTV Transaction is conditioned on the consummation of a pre-closing reorganization, which requires the completion of transfers of certain assets and liabilities between us and certain of our affiliates, which transfers may require consents from or approval of third parties. The Purchase Agreement is conditioned, among other things, upon the consummation of a pre-closing reorganization, which requires, among other things, that certain contracts and other assets, rights and liabilities are to be transferred between DISH DBS and certain of its affiliates in connection with the DIRECTV Transaction, as further described in the Purchase Agreement. The transfer of certain of these contracts and other assets, rights and liabilities may require consents or approvals of third parties or provide other rights to third parties. Some parties may use consent requirements or other rights to terminate contracts or obtain more favorable contractual terms from us, which, for example, could take the form of price increases for services or assets that we require, forcing us and/or our affiliates to either expend additional resources in order to obtain the services or assets previously provided under the contracts or to make arrangements with new third parties. If we do not obtain required consents or approvals, the DIRECTV Transaction may not be completed, or, if completed, we may not be reflective of the currently intended DIRECTV Transaction and we may be required to seek alternative arrangements, which may not come on a timely basis or at all, or be more costly and/or of lower quality. The termination, modification, replacement or replication of these contracts or permits or the failure to timely complete the transfer or assignment of these contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and on the prospects for completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. We have and continue to incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the DIRECTV Transaction. If the DIRECTV Transaction does not occur, we will not benefit from these transaction related costs. We have incurred and will continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction and the satisfaction of the related closing conditions, which could be substantial. Nonrecurring transaction costs may include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial, consulting, investment banking and accounting advisors and costs incurred in connection with obtaining required consents or approvals from governmental authorities or contract counterparties. Such costs may be material and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if the DIRECTV Transaction does not occur in a timely manner or at all, we may not be able to derive any benefit from such costs. The announcement and pendency of the DIRECTV Transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The announcement and pendency of the DIRECTV Transaction could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with respective existing and future customers, suppliers, vendors and employees, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether the DIRECTV Transaction is completed. In particular, we could potentially lose customers, suppliers or vendors, and new contracts with any of these third parties could be delayed, increased or decreased, and we may lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the DIRECTV Transaction. 

 111 

Table of Contents 
 Additionally, uncertainty about the completion and effect of the DIRECTV Transaction on our business, financial condition and results of operations may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel until the DIRECTV Transaction is completed. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the DIRECTV Transaction, as employees may feel uncertain about their future roles within each company after the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. If such employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty relating to the DIRECTV Transaction or a desire not to continue to be employees of ours or DTV after the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have expended, and continue to expend, significant management resources in an effort to complete the DIRECTV Transaction, which are being diverted from our day-to-day operations and future growth plans. In addition, the failure to complete the DIRECTV Transaction may result in negative publicity and/or a negative impression of us in the investment community and may affect our relationship with employees, customers and other partners in the business community. As a public company listed on a stock exchange, we may be a target of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the DIRECTV Transaction from being completed. Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into business combinations or merger agreements or similar agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment in connection with such a suit could result in monetary damages, which could also have a material adverse impact on DISH DBS s or our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the DIRECTV Transaction, then that injunction may delay or prevent the DIRECTV Transaction from being completed within the expected timeframe or at all, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. The Purchase Agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities prior to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction . The Purchase Agreement subjects us and our subsidiaries, particularly DISH DBS, to restrictions on our business activities prior to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. The Purchase Agreement obligates us generally to, among other things, operate our Pay-TV business in the ordinary course until the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction and to use our commercially reasonable efforts to preserve a substantially intact business organizations, operations and goodwill of the business and maintain in all material respects commercial relationships. These restrictions on our business activities may adversely affect our ability to execute certain business strategies outside of the ordinary course of business, including paying dividends or making distributions, pursuing attractive business opportunities, making certain investments or acquisitions, hiring or terminating certain employees, selling, leasing, or licensing material real property, settling litigation matters, entering into certain material contracts, selling assets, engaging in capital expenditures, incurring indebtedness or making changes to its business. Such limitations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations prior to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. The risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. For additional information, see the complete set of terms and conditions of the DIRECTV Transaction included in the Purchase Agreement.

 The Purchase Agreement also obligates us to, among other things, incur certain costs, make substantial investments in the Pay-TV business and take other actions, that absent the Purchase Agreement, we may or may not have taken. Absent certain exemptions in the Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to take such actions regardless if the DIRECTV Transaction is completed. These actions may be different than the historical manner in which we ran the business. As a holding company, we are dependent on the operations and funds of our subsidiaries. We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Our only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests in our subsidiaries. As a result, we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries to meet our obligations, including to service any of our debt obligations. On September 30, 2024, we announced a sale of our Pay-TV business, from which we derive a substantial portion of our cash flow. With the sale of that business, and the interim operating covenants that restrict our access to that cash, we will be required to, among other things, sell our Pay-TV business and transfer at least 400 million of cash (subject to certain upward adjustments) to DTV upon closing of the DIRECTV Transaction and we are prevented from declaring any dividend or otherwise permitting any leakage in excess of 1.520 billion (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including transaction expenses and certain accrued interest adjustments and adjustments tied to certain key performance indicators) between the signing and closing of the DIRECTV Transaction. As a result, our ability to fund our Wireless and Broadband Satellite Services business will be limited to by our cash flow from operations and ability to generate capital from our other businesses. The market price for shares of our Class A Common Stock after the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction may be affected by factors different from, or in addition to, those that historically have affected or currently affect the market prices of shares of our Class A Common Stock. Upon consummation of the DIRECTV Transaction, we will no longer own the Pay-TV business, but will continue to operate our Wireless and Broadband Satellite Services businesses. Accordingly, after the consummation of the DIRECTV Transaction, our results of operations may be affected by some factors that are different from those currently or historically affecting our results of operations. Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Exchange Offer On March 4, 2024, we commenced a tender offer to eligible employees (which excludes our co-founders and the non-executive/non-employee members of our Board of Directors) to exchange eligible stock options (which excludes the Ergen 2020 Performance Award) for new options as detailed in our Schedule TO filed March 4, 2024 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Exchange Offer ), to, among other things, further align employee incentives with the current market. The Exchange Offer expired on April 1, 2024 and we accepted for exchange approximately 7 million stock options. As a result of the Exchange Offer, during the second quarter of 2024, the exercise price of approximately 6 million new stock options, affecting approximately 1,000 eligible employees, was adjusted to 14.04. The new stock options were offered in reliance of the exemption from registration under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. For details on the terms of the new options, see Item 4 of our Schedule TO Tender Offer Statement dated March 4, 2024 and filed with the SEC on March 4, 2024.

With the expiration and closing of the EchoStar Exchange Offers on November 8, 2024, the PIPE Shares will be issued and settlement will occur on November 12, 2024. The PIPE Shares will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder.
