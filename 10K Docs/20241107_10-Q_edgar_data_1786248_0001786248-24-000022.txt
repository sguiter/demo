 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements relating to our liquidity and capital resources, our performance and results of operations contain forward-looking statements. Furthermore, all of the statements regarding future financial performance (including market conditions and demographics) are forward-looking statements. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements presented in this quarterly report are based on management s then-current beliefs and assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, "could," expect, intend, may, might, plan, estimate, project, should, will, would, result, the negative version of these words and similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. 
 Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. 
 Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, liquidity or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 
 Our loans and investments expose us to risks similar to and associated with debt-oriented real estate investments generally; 
 Commercial real estate-related investments that are secured, directly or indirectly, by real property are subject to delinquency, foreclosure and loss, which could result in losses to us; 
 Fluctuations in interest rate and credit spreads could reduce our ability to generate income on our loans and other investments, which could lead to a significant decrease in our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our investments; 
 Risks associated with the ownership of real estate; 
 Our loans and investments are concentrated in terms of type of interest, geography, asset types and sponsors and may continue to be so in the future; 
 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs; 
 We have limited operating history as a standalone company and may not be able to operate our business successfully, find suitable investments, or generate sufficient revenue to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders; 
 We may not replicate the historical results achieved by other entities managed or sponsored by affiliates of NexPoint Advisors, L.P. (our Sponsor ), members of the management team of NexPoint Real Estate Advisors VII, L.P. (our Manager or their affiliates; 
 We are dependent upon our Manager and its affiliates to conduct our day-to-day operations; thus, adverse changes in their financial health or our relationship with them could cause our operations to suffer; 
 Our Manager and its affiliates face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our Manager s compensation arrangements with us, including compensation which may be required to be paid to our Manager if our management agreement is terminated, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders; 
 We pay substantial fees and expenses to our Manager and its affiliates, which payments increase the risk that you will not earn a profit on your investment; 
 If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust (a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, cash available for distributions CAD to be paid to our stockholders could decrease materially, which would limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders;

 While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. They are based on estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this quarterly report.

 metropolitan statistical areas ("MSAs"). Substantially all of the Company s business is conducted through NexPoint Real Estate Finance Operating Partnership, L.P. (the OP ), the Company s operating partnership. As of September 30, 2024, the Company holds approximately of the common limited partnership units in the OP OP Units which represents of the Class A OP Units, and the OP owns all of the common limited partnership units SubOP Units of its subsidiary partnerships (collectively, the Subsidiary OPs (see Note 13). 
 The OP also directly owns all of the membership interests of a limited liability company (the Mezz LLC through which it owns a portfolio of mezzanine loans, as further discussed below. NexPoint Real Estate Finance OP GP, LLC (the OP GP is the sole general partner of the OP. 
 The Company commenced operations on February 11, 2020 upon the closing of its initial public offering of shares of its common stock (the IPO ). Prior to the closing of the IPO, the Company engaged in a series of transactions through which it acquired an initial portfolio consisting of senior pooled mortgage loans backed by SFR properties (the SFR Loans ), the junior most bonds of multifamily CMBS securitizations (the CMBS B-Pieces ), mezzanine loan and preferred equity investments in real estate companies and properties in other structured real estate investments within the multifamily, SFR and self-storage asset classes (the Initial Portfolio ). The Initial Portfolio was acquired from affiliates (the Contribution Group of NexPoint Advisors, L.P. (our Sponsor ), pursuant to a contribution agreement with the Contribution Group through which the Contribution Group contributed their interest in the Initial Portfolio to special purpose entities SPEs owned by the Subsidiary OPs, in exchange for SubOP Units (the Formation Transaction ). Subsequent to the Formation Transaction, the Company has continued to invest in asset types and real estate sectors within the Initial Portfolio and expanded to include additional asset types and real estate sectors. 
 The Company is externally managed by NexPoint Real Estate Advisors VII, L.P. (the Manager through a management agreement dated February 6, 2020 and amended as of July 17, 2020 and November 3, 2021, that renewed on February 6, 2024 for a term and is automatically renewed for successive terms thereafter unless earlier terminated (as amended, the Management Agreement ), by and between the Company and the Manager. The Manager conducts substantially all of the Company s operations and provides asset management services for its real estate investments. The Company expects it will only have accounting employees while the Management Agreement is in effect. All of the Company s investment decisions are made by the Manager, subject to general oversight by the Manager s investment committee and the Company s board of directors (the Board ). The Manager is wholly owned by our Sponsor. 
 The Company s primary investment objective is to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over the long term. The Company intends to achieve this objective primarily by originating, structuring and investing in our target assets. The Company concentrates on investments in real estate sectors where our senior management team has operating expertise, including in the multifamily, SFR, self-storage and life science sectors predominantly in the top MSAs. In addition, the Company targets lending or investing in properties that are stabilized or have a light transitional business plan, meaning a property that requires limited deferred funding to support leasing or ramp-up of operations and for which most capital expenditures are for value-add improvements. Through active portfolio management the Company seeks to take advantage of market opportunities to achieve a superior portfolio risk-mix that delivers attractive total returns.

 million reduction in retained earnings. The beginning allowance for credit loss as of January 1, 2024 was million. The reversal of credit losses of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is included in reversal of (provision for) credit losses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, resulting in an ending allowance for credit loss of million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Significant judgment is required in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting loss allowance, and actual losses, if any, could materially differ from those estimates. 
 The Company performs a quarterly review of the portfolio. In conjunction with this review, the Company assesses the risk factors of each loan, including, without limitation, loan-to-value ratio, debt yield, property type, geographic and local market dynamics, physical condition, collateral, cash-flow volatility, leasing and tenant profile, loan structure, exit plan and project sponsorship. Based on a 5-point scale, our loans are rated 1 through 5, from least risk to greatest risk, respectively, which ratings are defined as follows: 
 1 Outperform Materially exceeds performance metrics (for example, technical milestones, occupancy, rents and net operating income) included in original or current credit underwriting and business plan; 
 2 Exceeds Expectations Collateral performance exceeds substantially all performance metrics included in original or current credit underwriting and business plan; 
 3 Satisfactory Collateral performance meets, or is on track to meet, underwriting; business plan is met or can reasonably be achieved; 
 4 Underperformance Collateral performance falls short of underwriting, material differences exist from business plan, or both; technical milestones have been missed; defaults may exist or may soon occur absent material improvement; and 
 5 Risk of Impairment/Default Collateral performance is significantly worse than underwriting; major variance from business plan; loan covenants or technical milestones have been breached; timely exit from loan via sale or refinancing is questionable. 
 The Company regularly evaluates the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower. Specifically, the collateral s operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan and/or (iii) the collateral s liquidation value. The Company also evaluates the financial condition of any loan guarantors, as well as any changes in the borrower s competency in managing and operating the collateral. In addition, the Company considers the overall economic environment, real estate or industry sector and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as property operating statements, occupancy,

On a quarterly basis, the Company determines the value using widely accepted valuation techniques. A bottoms-up approach was used by valuing the wholly-owned self-storage assets in aggregate and development loans individually. In this bottoms-up approach, the discounted cash flow methodology is applied to the self-storage assets owned by NSP. Additionally, the income approach is used to determine the fair value of the development loans owned by NSP whereby contractual cash flows are discounted at observable market discount rates. In addition, as a secondary check for reasonableness, a top-down approach was applied whereby observable market terminal capitalization rates and discount rates are applied to the consolidated NSP cash flows. The valuation relies primarily on the bottoms-up approach but uses the top-down approach to corroborate the bottoms-up conclusion with a reasonable precision. 
 The Company owns approximately of the total outstanding shares of common stock of a private ground lease REIT (the "Private REIT") as of September 30, 2024. The Company elected the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825-10-10 for the Private REIT.

Our strategy is to originate, structure and invest in first-lien mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, convertible notes, multifamily properties and common stock investments, as well as multifamily and SFR CMBS securitizations, promissory notes and mortgage backed securities, or our target assets. We primarily focus on investments in real estate sectors where our senior management team has operating expertise, including in the multifamily, SFR, self-storage and life science sectors predominantly in the top 50 MSAs. In addition, we target lending or investing in properties that are stabilized or have a light-transitional business plan.

 Our investment objective is to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over the long term. We seek to employ a flexible and relative-value focused investment strategy and expect to re-allocate capital periodically among our target investment classes. We believe this flexibility will enable us to efficiently manage risk and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns under a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. 
 We are externally managed by our Manager, a subsidiary of our Sponsor, an SEC-registered investment advisor, which has extensive real estate experience, having completed as of September 30, 2024 approximately 20.1 billion of gross real estate transactions since the beginning of 2012. In addition, our Sponsor, together with its affiliates and NexBank, is one of the most experienced global alternative credit managers managing approximately 9.6 billion of loans and debt or credit related investments as of September 30, 2024 and has managed credit investments for over 25 years. We believe our relationship with our Sponsor benefits us by providing access to resources including research capabilities, an extensive relationship network, other proprietary information, scalability, and a vast wealth of knowledge of information on real estate in our target assets and sectors. 
 We elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain one or more exclusions or exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act.

Table of Contents 

 The following tables set forth a summary of our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Net interest income 12,518 4,817 7,701 159.9 Other income (expense) 18,659 (15,535) 34,194 (220.1) Operating expenses (7,844) (6,332) (1,512) 23.9 Net income (loss) 23,333 (17,050) 40,383 (236.9) Net (income) loss attributable to Series A Preferred stockholders (874) (874) NA Net (income) loss attributable to Series B Preferred stockholders (2,403) (2,403) NA Net (income) loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests (3,940) 2,374 (6,314) (266.0) Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders 16,116 (15,550) 31,666 (203.6) 
 The change in our net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relates to an increase in interest income due to higher yielding assets and a decrease in interest expense related to the repayment of one of our senior loans. Our net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 16.1 million. We had approximately 12.5 million in net interest income, generated income of 18.7 million in other income, incurred operating expenses of 7.8 million, allocated 0.9 million of income to Series A Preferred stockholders, allocated 2.4 million of income to Series B Preferred stockholders, and allocated 3.9 million of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Revenues 
 Net interest income. Net interest income was 12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net interest income of 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 which was an increase of approximately 7.7 million. The increase between the periods is primarily due to an increase in interest income due to higher yielding assets and a decrease in interest expense from the repayment of one of our senior loans. As of September 30, 2024 we own 83 discrete investments compared to 89 as of September 30, 2023. 
 Other income (expense). Other income was 18.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (15.5) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 34.2 million. This was primarily due to an increase in unrealized gain related to consolidated CMBS VIEs and an increase in fair value marks between the periods. 
 Expenses 
 G A expenses. G A expenses were 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 0.3 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to 0.2 million increase in payroll expense compared to the prior period. 
 Loan servicing fees. Loan servicing fees were 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 0.7 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to a decrease in SFR Loans in the portfolio compared to the prior period. 
 Management fees. Management fees were 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Expenses from consolidated real estate owned . Expenses from consolidated real estate owned were 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 2.4 million. The increase is due to the consolidation of Alexander at the District.

 The change in our net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relates to an increase in other income. Our net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 9.3 million. We had approximately 6.4 million in net interest income, generated income of 42.0 million in other income, incurred operating expenses of 27.7 million, allocated 2.6 million of income to Series A Preferred stockholders, allocated 4.5 million of income to Series B Preferred stockholders, and allocated 4.3 million of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Revenues 
 Net interest income. Net interest loss was 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net interest income of 13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 6.5 million. The decrease between the periods is primarily due to accelerated amortization of the premium associated with the prepayment on a senior loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 we own 83 discrete investments compared to 89 as of September 30, 2023.

Other income was 42.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which was an increase of approximately 37.2 million. This was primarily due to an increase in unrealized gains related to consolidated CMBS VIEs, an increase in fair value marks between the periods and a reversal of credit losses. 
 Expenses 
 G A expenses. G A expenses were 9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 2.4 million.

 Loan servicing fees. Loan servicing fees were 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 1.9 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to a decrease in SFR Loans in the portfolio compared to the prior period.

 Key Financial Measures and Indicators 
 As a real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared, EAD, CAD and book value per share. 
 Earnings Per Share and Dividends Declared 
 The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share and dividends declared per share (in thousands, except per share data): 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net income attributable to common stockholders 16,116 (15,550) 203.6 Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests 3,940 (2,374) 266.0 Net (income) loss attributable to Series B preferred stockholders 2,403 N/A Weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding Basic 17,461 17,232 1.3 Diluted 30,468 23,086 32.0 Net income per share, basic 0.92 (0.90) 202.3 Net income per share, diluted 0.74 (0.90) 182.2 Dividends declared per share 0.5000 0.6850 (27.0) 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net income attributable to common stockholders 9,317 (3,236) 387.9 Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests 4,322 1,419 204.6 Net (income) loss attributable to Series B preferred stockholders 4,545 N/A Weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding Basic 17,383 17,188 1.1 Diluted 27,673 22,950 20.6 Net income per share, basic 0.54 (0.19) 384.7 Net income per share, diluted 0.54 (0.08) 782.1 Dividends declared per share 1.5000 2.0550 (27.0) 
 
 Earnings Available for Distribution, Cash Available for Distribution and Adjusted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding - Diluted 
 EAD is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe EAD serves as a useful indicator for investors in evaluating our performance and our long-term ability to pay distributions. EAD is defined as the net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in net income (loss), excluding any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income (loss) for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income (loss), or in net income (loss) and adding back amortization of stock-based compensation. Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders may also be adjusted for the effects of certain GAAP adjustments and transactions that may not be indicative of our current operations. 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 We use EAD to evaluate our performance which excludes the effects of certain GAAP adjustments and transactions that we believe are not indicative of our current operations and to assess our long-term ability to pay distributions. We believe providing EAD as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) to our investors is helpful to their assessment of our performance and our long term ability to pay distributions. EAD does not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. Our computation of EAD may not be comparable to EAD reported by other REITs. 
 We also use EAD as a component of the management fee paid to our Manager. As consideration for the Manager s services, we will pay our Manager an annual management fee of 1.5 of Equity, paid monthly, in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of our Manager. Equity means (a) the sum of (1) total stockholders equity immediately prior to the closing of our IPO, plus (2) the net proceeds received by us from all issuances of our equity securities in and after the IPO, plus (3) our cumulative EAD from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, (b) less (1) any distributions to our holders of common stock from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter and (2) all amounts that we have paid to repurchase for cash the shares of our equity securities from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. In our calculation of Equity, we will adjust our calculation of EAD to remove the compensation expense relating to awards granted under one or more of our long-term incentive plans that is added back in our calculation of EAD. Additionally, for the avoidance of doubt, Equity does not include the assets contributed to us in the Formation Transaction. For the purpose of calculating EAD for the management fee, net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders may be adjusted for the effects of certain GAAP adjustments and transactions that may not be indicative of our current operations, in each case after discussions between the Manager and the independent directors of our Board and approved by a majority of the independent directors of our Board. 
 CAD is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate CAD by adjusting EAD by adding back amortization of premiums, depreciation and amortization of real estate investment, amortization of deferred financing costs and by removing accretion of discounts and non-cash items, such as stock dividends. We use CAD to evaluate our performance and our current ability to pay distributions. We also believe that providing CAD as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) to our investors is helpful to their assessment of our performance and our current ability to pay distributions. CAD does not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. Our computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other REITs. 
 Starting in the second quarter of 2024, EAD per diluted common share and CAD per diluted common share are based on adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted. Adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted is a non-GAAP measure calculated by subtracting the dilutive effect of potential redemptions of Series B Preferred shares for shares of our common stock from weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted. We believe providing adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted and EAD per diluted common share and CAD per diluted common share based on adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted is helpful to our investors in their assessment of our performance without the potential dilutive effective of the Series B Preferred shares. We have the right to redeem the Series B Preferred shares for cash or shares of our common stock. Additionally, Series B Preferred redemptions are capped at 2 of the outstanding Series B Preferred shares per month, 5 per quarter and 20 per year. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to pay cash to cover any redemptions up to the quarterly redemption cap. Further, it is the Company's intent to not settle Series B Preferred redemptions in shares of common stock when the Company's common stock price is below book value. 
 Adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted should not be considered as an alternative to the GAAP measures. Our computation of adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted may not be comparable to adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted reported by other companies. 
 Prior period EAD per diluted common share and CAD per diluted common share have not been updated to reflect this adjustment as the dilutive effect of the Series B Preferred redemptions were immaterial to prior periods. 
 The following tables provide a reconciliation of EAD and CAD to GAAP net income including the dilutive effect of noncontrolling interests and adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted to weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

 (1) Starting in the third quarter of 2023, the Company has adjusted EAD to remove the (income) / loss from equity method investments as it does not represent distributable earnings. Prior periods have been updated to reflect this adjustment. We will include income from equity method investments to the extent that we receive cash distributions and upon realizing gains and/or losses. 
 (2) Unrealized gains are the net change in unrealized loss on investments held at fair value applicable to common stockholders. 
 (3) Starting in the second quarter of 2024, EAD per diluted common share, CAD per diluted common share and adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted do not include the dilutive effect of the potential redemption of Series B Preferred Stock for common shares. Prior periods have not been updated to reflect this adjustment because the dilutive effect of potential Series B Preferred redemptions were immaterial to prior periods.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, maintain our investments, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. Our investments generate liquidity on an ongoing basis through principal and interest payments, prepayments and dividends. We believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows, and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments, potential obligations to fulfill unfunded commitments and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following September 30, 2024. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of acquiring additional investments, scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include future debt or equity issuances, net cash provided by operations and other secured and unsecured borrowings. Our leverage is matched in term and structure to provide stable contractual spreads which will protect us from fluctuations in market interest rates over the long-term. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders, general market conditions for REITs and our operating performance and liquidity. We believe that our various sources of capital, which may include future debt or equity issuances, net cash provided by operations and other secured and unsecured borrowings, will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated debt service payments, potential obligations to purchase investments under the Company's commitments noted in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and dividend requirements for the long-term.

 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources to date consist of cash generated from our operating results and the following: 
 Freddie Mac Credit Facilities 
 Prior to the Formation Transaction, two of our subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement, dated July 12, 2019, with Freddie Mac (the Credit Facility ). Under the Credit Facility, these entities borrowed approximately 788.8 million in connection with their acquisition of senior pooled mortgage loans backed by SFR properties (the Underlying Loans ). No additional borrowings can be made under the Credit Facility, and our obligations will be secured by the Underlying Loans. The Credit Facility was assumed by the Company as part of the Formation Transaction. As such, the remaining outstanding balance of 788.8 million was contributed to the Company on February 11, 2020. Our borrowings under the Credit Facility will mature on July 12, 2029; however, if an Underlying Loan matures prior to July 12, 2029, we will be required to repay the portion of the Credit Facility that is allocated to that loan. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility was 113.3 million. 
 Repurchase Agreements 
 From time to time, we may enter into repurchase agreements to finance the acquisition of our target assets. Repurchase agreements will effectively allow us to borrow against loans and securities that we own in an amount equal to (1) the market value of such loans and/or securities multiplied by (2) the applicable advance rate. Under these agreements, we will sell our loans and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus an interest factor. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we will receive the principal and interest on the related loans and securities and pay interest to the lender under the

 repurchase agreement. At any point in time, the amounts and the cost of our repurchase borrowings will be based on the assets being financed. For example, higher risk assets will result in lower advance rates (i.e., levels of leverage) at higher borrowing costs. In addition, these facilities may include various financial covenants and limited recourse guarantees. 
 As discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, we, through the OP and the Subsidiary OPs, have borrowed approximately 239.0 million under our repurchase agreements and posted approximately 1.0 billion par value of our CMBS B-Piece, CMBS I/O Strip and mortgage backed security investments as collateral. The CMBS B-Pieces, CMBS I/O Strips and mortgage backed securities held as collateral are illiquid and irreplaceable in nature. These assets are restricted solely to satisfy the interest and principal balances owed to the lender as described in our Annual Report.

 At-The-Market Offering 
 On March 15, 2022, the Company, the OP and the Manager separately entered into the 2022 Equity Distribution Agreements with the 2022 Sales Agents, pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell from time to time shares of the Company s common stock and Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate sales price of up to 100.0 million in the 2022 ATM Program. The 2022 Equity Distribution Agreements provide for the issuance and sale of common stock or Series A Preferred Stock by the Company through a sales agent acting as a sales agent or directly to the sales agent acting as principal for its own account at a price agreed upon at the time of sale. As of September 30, 2024, pursuant to the 2022 Equity Distribution Agreements, the Company had sold 531,728 shares of its common stock and zero shares of Series A Preferred Stock for total gross sales of 12.6 million. For additional information about the 2022 ATM Program, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.

 Other Potential Sources of Financing 
 We may seek additional sources of liquidity from further repurchase facilities, other borrowings and future offerings of common and preferred equity and debt securities and contributions from existing holders of the OP or Subsidiary OPs. In addition, we may apply our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to any liquidity needs. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 34.7 million. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents selected data from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (in thousands): 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 24,925 28,428 Net cash provided by investing activities 735,935 639,485 Net cash (used in) financing activities (738,802) (675,341) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 22,058 (7,428) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 16,649 20,347 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period 38,707 12,919

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 24.9 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 28.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease primarily relates to the change in unrealized gains on investments held at fair value. 
 Cash flows from investing activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 735.9 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 639.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. 
 We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, and may elect to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. We may be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. 
 
 Dividends 
 We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock. We also intend to make the accrued dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock, which are payable quarterly in arrears as provided in the articles supplementary setting forth the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock, which are payable monthly as provided in the articles supplementary setting forth the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85 of our ordinary income, (2) 95 of our capital gain net income and (3) 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income, which is not used to pay a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, to holders of our common stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities. 
 We will make dividend payments to holders of our common stock based on our estimate of taxable earnings per share of common stock, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair-value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion and non-deductible G A expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share of our common stock may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. Our Board declared the second regular quarterly dividend to common stockholders of 0.50 per share on April 29, 2024, which was paid on June 28, 2024, to stockholders of record as of June 14, 2024.

On March 22, 2024, our Board declared a Series B Preferred Stock dividend to Series B Preferred stockholders of 0.1875, which was paid on May 6, 2024, to stockholders of record as of April 25, 2024.

Our Board declared the third regular quarterly dividend to common stockholders of 0.50 per share on July 29, 2024, which was paid on September 30, 2024, to stockholders of record as of September 13, 2024. On July 16, 2024, our Board declared a Series B Preferred Stock dividend to Series B Preferred stockholders of 0.1875, which was paid on September 5, 2024, to stockholders of record as of August 23, 2024. On August 19, 2024, our Board declared a Series B Preferred Stock dividend to Series B Preferred stockholders of 0.1875, which was paid on October 7, 2024, to stockholders of record as of September 25. On September 9, 2024, our Board declared a Series A Preferred Stock dividend of 0.53125 per share, which was paid on October 25, 2024, to stockholders of record as of October 15, 2024.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had one off balance sheet arrangement that has or is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 On December 8, 2022 and in connection with a restructuring of NSP, the Company, through REIT Sub, together with NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust ("NXDT"), an entity that is advised by an affiliate of the Manager, Highland Income Fund and NexPoint Real Estate Strategies Fund (collectively, the "Co-Guarantors"), as guarantors, entered into a sponsor guaranty agreement (the "NSP Sponsor Guaranty Agreement") in favor of Extra Space Storage, LP ("Extra Space") pursuant to which REIT Sub and the Co-Guarantors guaranteed obligations of NSP with respect to accrued dividends on NSP s newly created Series D preferred stock and two promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of approximately 64.2 million issued to Extra Space. The guaranties by REIT Sub and the Co-Guarantors are capped at 97.6 million, and each of REIT Sub and the Co-Guarantors generally guaranteed the foregoing obligations of NSP up to the cap amount on a pro rata basis with respect to its percentage ownership of NSP s common stock. On February 15, 2023, NSP paid down approximately 15.0 million of these promissory notes, resulting in an aggregate principal amount of approximately 49.2 million. On December 8, 2023, NSP paid down the remaining principal balance of 49.2 million. The NSP Series D preferred stock remains outstanding as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding NSP Series D Preferred Stock accrued dividends was 11.6 million and the Company and NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust are jointly and severally liable for 85.90 of the guaranteed amount equal to 10.0 million. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 Except as otherwise disclosed below, the Company is not aware of any contractual obligations, legal proceedings or any other contingent obligations incurred in the normal course of business that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 On September 29, 2021, the Company, through one of the Subsidiary OPs, entered into an agreement to purchase up to 50.0 million in a new preferred equity investment (the Preferred Units upon notice from the issuer. Subject to certain conditions, the Company may be required to purchase an additional 25.0 million of Preferred Units at the option of the issuer. The funds are expected to be used to capitalize special purpose limited liability companies PropCos to engage in sale-and-leaseback transactions and development transactions on life science real property. On September, 22, 2023, the issuer exercised its right to extend the final obligation date to purchase any additional Preferred Units to September 29, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has fully funded the commitments under the Preferred Units agreement. The Preferred Units accrue distributions at a rate of 10.0 annually, compounded monthly. Distributions on the Preferred Units will be paid in cash with respect to stabilized PropCos and paid in kind with respect to unstabilized PropCos. The obligations of the issuer will be supported by a pledge of all equity units of the PropCos. All or a portion of the Preferred Units may be redeemed at any time for a redemption price equal to the purchase price of the Preferred Units to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid distributions thereon and a cash redemption fee. Upon the redemption of any Preferred Units and if the parties agree, the remaining amount to be funded by the Company may be increased by the aggregate purchase price of the redeemed Preferred Units. In addition, if the issuer experiences a change of control, the redemption price will also include a payment equal to the amount needed to achieve a multiple on invested capital ("MOIC") equal to 1.25x for unstabilized PropCos and 1.10x for stabilized PropCos. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not recorded any contingencies related to the Preferred Units agreement on its Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company's commitment is fully funded. 
 The Company provides certain guarantees in connection with the NSP Sponsor Guaranty Agreement. See Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements above for further details. 
 On March 14, 2023, the Company, through one of the Subsidiary OPs, committed to fund 24.0 million of preferred equity with respect to a ground up construction horizontal single-family property located in Phoenix, Arizona, of which 10.5 million was unfunded as of September 30, 2024. The preferred equity investment provides a floating annual return that is the greater of prime rate plus 5.0 or 11.25 , compounded monthly with a MOIC of 1.30x and 1.0 placement fee. The Company was also issued a common interest at the time of its first funding of preferred equity on May 16, 2023.

There was no value ascribed to the common interest as of September 30, 2024. Further, once the Company's preferred equity and accrued interest has been repaid, any additional cash flow and net sale proceeds shall be distributed as follows:

The IQHQ Promissory Note will automatically convert into Series E preferred stock of IQHQ, L.P. upon a Qualified Equity Financing (as defined in the IQHQ Promissory Note). In accordance with the Purchase Agreement, IQHQ Holdings, L.P. IQHQ Holdings also issued and sold a corresponding warrant to Bridge Investor I to purchase Class A-3 Units of IQHQ Holdings (the IQHQ Warrant ). The IQHQ Warrant entitles the holder to purchase, at an exercise price of 0.01, Class A-3 Units of IQHQ Holdings representing up to 6.25 of the fully diluted and outstanding common equity of IQHQ Holdings if the IQHQ Promissory Note is fully funded. The IQHQ Warrant is exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time, and expires on May 23, 2034, unless there is an earlier change of control, initial public offering or liquidation. 
 In connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company, through certain subsidiaries, along with certain entities advised by affiliates of our Manager (the IQHQ Participating Purchasers entered into a participation rights agreement with Bridge Investor I pursuant to which the Company and the IQHQ Participating Purchasers have a right to fund up to specified amounts of the IQHQ Promissory Note and the IQHQ Warrant. Upon receipt of a draw request, each IQHQ Participating Purchaser will have the right to elect to fund an amount equal or greater than zero up to their respective preemptive right under the IQHQ Holdings or IQHQ, L.P. organizational documents less the total amount of advances previously made by such IQHQ Participating Purchaser.

 right to pledge or exchange the assets and provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor, and (3) the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. The IQHQ Promissory Note is classified as Loans, held-for-investment, net, and the IQHQ Warrant is classified as Stock warrant investments. The IQHQ Warrant is accounted for as investments in equity securities under ASC 321, Investments Equity Securities , and the Company elected to use the measurement alternative to measure the investment at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, if any.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for changes that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management s historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that involve significant estimation uncertainty that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 We adopted ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2023. The implementation process included the utilization of loan loss forecasting models, updates to our loan credit loss policy documentation, changes to internal reporting processes and related internal controls, and overall operational readiness for our adoption of the new standard. We have implemented loan loss forecasting models for estimating expected life-time credit losses, at the individual loan level, for our loan portfolio. These models are also utilized for estimating expected life-time credit losses for unfunded loan commitments for which the Company has a present contractual obligation to extend the credit and the obligation is not unconditionally cancellable. The CECL forecasting methods used by the Company include (i) a probability of default and loss given default method using underlying third-party CMBS/Commercial Real Estate loan database with historical loan losses from 1998 to 2022, and (ii) probability weighted expected cash flow method, depending on the type of loan and the availability of relevant historical market loan loss data. We might use other acceptable alternative approaches in the future depending on, among other factors, the type of loan, underlying collateral, and availability of relevant historical market loan loss data. Significant inputs to our forecasting methods include (i) key loan-specific inputs such as loan-to-value, vintage year, loan-term, underlying property type, occupancy, geographic location, performance against the underwritten business plan, and our internal loan risk rating, and (ii) a macro-economic environment forecast. The cumulative effect of adoption of ASU 2016-13 is a 1.6 million reduction in retained earnings. The beginning allowance for credit loss as of January 1, 2024 was 2.1 million. The reversal of credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is included in other income on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, resulting in a September 30, 2024 ending allowance for credit loss of 1.4 million. 
 Significant judgment is required in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting loss allowance, and actual losses, if any, could materially differ from those estimates.

 Valuation of Common Equity and Preferred Stock 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owns approximately 25.7 of the total outstanding shares of NSP and thus can exercise significant influence over NSP. The Company elected the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825-10-10. On a quarterly basis, the Company, with the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm, determines the fair value for subsequent measurement absent a readily available market price. The valuation is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques consistent with the principles of ASC 820. Specifically, these techniques include the discounted cash flow methodology whereby observable market terminal capitalization rates and discount rates are applied to projected cash flows generated by self-storage assets owned by NSP. The necessary inputs for the valuation include projected cash flows of NSP, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates. These inputs are reflective of public company comparables but are assumptions and estimates. As a result, the determination of fair value involves significant estimation uncertainty because it involves subjective judgments and estimates that are based on unobservable inputs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the unrealized gain (loss) related to the change in fair value estimate is 2.6 million. See Notes 5 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding the valuation of NSP. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owns approximately 6.4 of the total outstanding common equity of the Private REIT. The Company records the Private REIT at fair value in accordance with ASC 321, Investments - Equity Securities . The valuation is determined using a market approach. The necessary input for the valuation includes the yield of the Private REIT. As a result, the determination of fair value is uncertain because it involves subjective judgments and estimates that are unobservable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the unrealized loss related to the change in fair value estimate is 0.9 million. See Notes 5 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding the valuation of the Private REIT. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owns approximately 98.0 of the total outstanding common equity of each of RFGH and RTB, 12.3 of the total outstanding common equity of SK Apartments, and 79.1 of the total outstanding membership interests of CAP. The Company holds these equity method investments based on the Company's proportionate share of income (losses) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Notes 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding the equity method investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owns 9.5 of the total outstanding shares of the Series D-1 preferred stock in IQHQ, Inc. See Notes 5 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding the equity security investment in IQHQ, Inc. 
 Considerations Related to Tightening Monetary Policy 
 The macroeconomic environment remains challenging as central banks have held interest rates high to combat inflation. The high rate environment, coupled with large bank failures in early 2023 and ongoing economic uncertainty, has limited credit availability to commercial real estate. Less available and more expensive debt capital has had pronounced effects on the capital markets, making investments harder to finance. Similar factors also impact the timing of and proceeds generated from asset sales and our ability to obtain debt capital. 
 
 REIT Tax Election 
 We elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, as defined by the Code, to our stockholders. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. We believe that our organization and current and proposed method of operation will allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of September 30, 2024, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 We believe, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
