 The Company s unrealized losses from marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were caused primarily by interest rate increases. The Company does not intend to sell marketable securities that are in an unrealized loss position, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity. There was allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale marketable securities at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, other liabilities, accounts payable, certain accrued expenses, and borrowings which consist of a term loan and a revolving credit facility. The carrying values of the financial instruments classified as current in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities. The Company's cash and cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure its loans to physician partner groups, primarily in connection with taxes payable on shares distributed to them upon completion of the Company's initial public offering ("IPO"), at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Such measurements are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of the term loan and revolving credit facility are a reasonable estimate of fair value because the interest rates on such borrowings approximate market rates as of the reporting date. Such borrowings are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no material transfers of financial assets or liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. 
 The Company measures and discloses the fair value of nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities utilizing a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value measurement are considered to be observable or unobservable in a marketplace. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. These inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: 
 Level 1 quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 
 Level 2 quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
 Level 3 fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.

 Risk-bearing Entities. At September 30, 2024, the Company operates wholly-owned risk-bearing entities RBEs for the purpose of entering into risk-bearing contracts with payors. Each RBE s equity at risk is considered insufficient to finance its activities without additional support, and, therefore, each RBE is considered a VIE. The Company consolidates the RBEs as it has determined that it is the primary beneficiary because it has: (i) the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the RBEs economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the RBEs. Specifically, the Company has the unilateral ability and authority, through the RBE governance and management agreements, to make significant decisions about strategic and operating activities of the RBEs, including negotiating and entering into risk-bearing contracts with payors, and approving the RBEs annual operating budgets. The Company also has the obligation to fund losses of the RBEs and the right to receive a significant percentage of any financial surplus generated by the RBEs. The assets of the RBEs primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, net, intangible assets, net, and other assets. Its obligations primarily consist of medical claims and related payables as well as operating expenses of the RBEs (accounts payable and accrued expenses), including incentive compensation obligations to the Company s physician partners. On February 18, 2021, the Company executed the Credit Facility, which is guaranteed by certain of the Company s VIEs. Assets generated by the RBEs (primarily from medical services revenues) may be used, in certain limited circumstances, to settle the Company s contractual debt obligations. 
 Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had equity method investees, including wholly-owned CMS ACO Models entities discussed below, that were deemed to be VIEs. The Company has determined that the activities that most significantly impact the performance of these VIEs consist of the allocation of resources to and other decisions related to clinical activities and provider contracting decisions. Because the Company does not have the ability to control these activities due to another party s control of the VIEs board of directors, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of and therefore does not consolidate these VIEs. The Company provided support to assist its CMS ACO Models investments in obtaining surety bonds related to risk-bearing capital contributions to CMS. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the ACOs had million and million outstanding surety bonds. The Company's maximum loss exposure as a result of the Company s involvement with the VIEs cannot be quantified as the Company has the obligation to provide ongoing operational support to the unconsolidated VIEs, as needed.

 Overview and Recent Developments 
 Our business is transforming healthcare by empowering the primary care physicians PCPs to be the agent for change in the communities they serve. We believe that PCPs, with their intimate patient-physician relationships, are best positioned to drive meaningful change in quality, cost, and patient experience when provided with the right infrastructure and payment model. Through our combination of the agilon platform, a long-term partnership model with existing physician groups and a growing network of like-minded physicians, we are poised to revolutionize healthcare for seniors across communities throughout the United States. Our purpose-built model provides the necessary capabilities, capital, and business model for existing physician groups to create a Medicare-centric, globally capitated line of business. Our model operates by forming risk-bearing entities RBEs within local geographies, that enter into arrangements with payors providing for monthly payments to manage the total healthcare needs of our physician partners attributed patients (or, global capitation arrangements). The RBEs also contract with agilon to perform certain functions and enter into long-term professional service agreements with one or more anchor physician groups pursuant to which the anchor physician groups receive a base compensation rate and share in the savings from successfully improving quality of care and reducing costs. 
 Our business model is differentiated by its focus on existing community-based physician groups and is built around three key elements: (1) agilon s platform; (2) agilon s long-term physician partnership approach; and (3) agilon s network. With our model, our goal is to remove the barriers that prevent community-based physicians from evolving to a Total Care Model, where the physician is empowered to manage health outcomes and the total healthcare needs of their attributed Medicare patients.

 Key Financial and Operating Metrics 
 All of our key metrics exclude historical results from our Hawaii operations (which are included as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 We monitor the following key financial and operating metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. We believe the following key metrics are useful in evaluating our business (dollars in thousands): 
 As of and For the As of and For the Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change MA members 525,200 384,200 37 525,200 384,200 37 Medical services revenue 1,447,697 1,133,457 28 4,528,471 3,253,810 39 Gross profit (64,167) 36,839 (274) 43,096 164,538 (74) Medical margin (1)

 ___________________________________________ 
 (1) Medical margin and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. Gross profit is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP to medical margin. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for additional information. 
 Medicare Advantage Members 
 Our MA members include all individuals enrolled in an MA plan that are attributed to the PCPs on our platform at the end of a given period. 
 Medical Services Revenue 
 Our medical services revenue consists of capitation revenue under contracts with various payors. Under the typical capitation arrangement, we are entitled to per member per month ("PMPM") fees to provide a defined range of healthcare services for MA health plan members through our contracted physician partners and affiliated PCPs. Such fees are typically based on a defined percentage of corresponding premium that payors receive from the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services' CMS ). We recognize capitation revenue over the period eligible members are entitled to receive healthcare services. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit represents the amount earned from total revenues less medical services expense and other medical expenses. Total revenues include medical services revenue and other operating revenue. The Company s costs of revenues consist of medical services expense and other medical expenses, which represents the costs that are directly related to providing the services that generate revenue.

 ___________________________________________ 
 (1) Represents physician compensation expense related to surplus sharing and other care management expenses that help to create medical cost efficiency. Includes costs in geographies that are in implementation and are not yet generating revenue and investments to grow existing markets. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, costs incurred in implementing geographies were 1.4 million and 10.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, costs incurred in implementing geographies were 2.0 million and 20.3 million, respectively. 
 Medical Margin 
 We define medical margin as medical services revenue after medical services expense is deducted. Medical services expense represents costs incurred for medical services provided to our members. As our platform matures over time, we expect medical margin to increase in absolute dollars. However, medical margin PMPM may vary as the percentage of new members brought onto our platform fluctuates. New membership added to the platform is typically dilutive to medical margin PMPM. 
 See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for information regarding our use of medical margin and a reconciliation of gross profit to medical margin. 
 Platform Support Costs 
 Our platform support costs, which include regionally-based support personnel and other operating costs to support our geographies, are expected to decrease over time as a percentage of revenue as our physician partners add members and our revenue grows. Our operating expenses at the enterprise level include resources and technology to support payor contracting, clinical program development, quality, data management, finance, and legal and compliance functions. 
 The table below represents costs to support our live geographies and enterprise functions, which are included in general and administrative expenses (dollars in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Platform support costs 42,353 41,590 129,752 126,923 of Revenue 3 4 3 4 
 Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude: (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) interest expense, (iii) income tax expense (benefit), (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) stock-based compensation expense, (vi) severance and related costs, and (vii) certain other items that are not considered by us in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We reflect our share of Adjusted EBITDA for equity method investments by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity-by-entity basis. 
 See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA.

 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 Medical Services Revenue 
 Our medical services revenue consists of capitation revenue under contracts with various payors. Under the typical capitation arrangement, we are entitled to PMPM fees to provide a defined range of healthcare services for MA health plan members through our contracted physician partners and affiliated PCPs. Such fees are typically based on a defined percentage of corresponding premium that payors receive from CMS. We recognize capitation revenue over the period eligible members are entitled to receive healthcare services. 
 Medical services revenue constitutes substantially all of our total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Medical Services Expense 
 In each of our geographies, a network of physicians, hospitals, and other healthcare providers provide care to our members. Medical services expense represents costs incurred for medical services provided to our members. Our medical services expense trends primarily relate to changes in per visit costs incurred by our members, along with changes in health system and provider utilization of services. Medical services expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include estimates of our obligations for medical services that have been rendered by third parties but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. 
 Other Medical Expenses 
 Other medical expenses include: (i) partner physician compensation expense and (ii) other provider costs. Partner physician compensation expense represents obligations to our physician partners corresponding to a portion of the surplus generated in our geographies, which is a function of medical services revenues less the sum of medical services expenses, other provider costs and market operating costs, for the respective geography. Physician payment obligations are reconciled quarterly, and settlement payments are typically issued to providers on an annual basis in arrears, with interim payments issued periodically. Other provider costs include payments to support physician-patient engagement, certain other medical costs, and other care management expenses that help to create medical cost efficiency. Other provider costs include costs incurred for geographies that are in implementation and are not yet generating revenue. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist of market-based support personnel and other operating costs to support our geographies, personnel and other operating costs to support our enterprise functions, and investments to support development and expansion of our physician partners. Our enterprise functions include salaries and related expenses, stock-based compensation (including shares issued under partner physician group equity agreements), operational support expenses, technology infrastructure, finance, and legal, as well as other costs associated with the continued growth of our platform. For the purposes of calculating physician partner incentive expense, we allocate a portion of our enterprise general and administrative expenses to our geographies. General and administrative expenses also include severance and accruals for unasserted claims. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses are associated with our property and equipment and acquired intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with computer equipment and software, furniture and fixtures, and leasehold improvements. Amortization primarily includes expenses associated with acquired intangible assets. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 Other Income (Expense) 
 Income (loss) from equity method investments 
 Income (loss) from equity method investments consists primarily of income associated with our participation in the CMS Shared Savings Program MSSP ), along with its existing participation in the Accountable Care Organization Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health ACO REACH Model, (collectively, CMS ACO Models ). 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net includes interest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities, including amortization/accretion of discount/premium. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including amortization of debt discounts and costs. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
 We are subject to corporate U.S. federal, state, and local income taxation. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management believes it is not more likely than not to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. Management makes estimates and judgments about future taxable income based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates. 
 Total Discontinued Operations 
 Total discontinued operations primarily consist of the results of our Hawaii operations. For certain of our divestiture transactions, we continue to be responsible for any liabilities arising from the business that were incurred prior to the closing date of such transaction, including any fines, penalties, and other sanctions, the payment of claims for medical services incurred prior to the effective date of each transaction, a liability for unrecognized tax benefits for which we are indemnified, and other contingent liabilities that we currently believe are remote. For additional discussion, see Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present medical margin and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. 
 We define medical margin as medical services revenue after medical services expense is deducted. Medical services expense represents costs incurred for medical services provided to our members. As our platform matures over time, we expect medical margin to increase in absolute dollars. However, medical margin PMPM may vary as the percentage of new members brought onto our platform fluctuates. New membership added to the platform is typically dilutive to medical margin PMPM. We believe this metric provides insight into the economics of our capitation arrangements as it includes all medical services expense directly associated with our members care. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude: (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) interest expense, (iii) income tax expense (benefit), (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) stock-based compensation expense, (vi) severance and related costs, and (vii) certain other items that are not considered by us in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We reflect our share of Adjusted EBITDA for equity method investments by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity-by-entity basis. 
 Gross profit is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure to medical margin. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA. 
 We believe medical margin and Adjusted EBITDA help identify underlying trends in our business and facilitate evaluation of period-to-period operating performance of our operations by eliminating items that are variable in nature and not considered by us in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance, allowing comparison of our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. We also believe medical margin and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics we use for financial and operational decision-making. We believe medical margin and Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled non-GAAP measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies, and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance. Other companies may calculate medical margin and Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently from the way we calculate these metrics. As a result, our presentation of medical margin and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 Adjusted EBITDA is not considered a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and the items excluded therefrom are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to such U.S. GAAP measures as net income (loss), cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing, or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in our consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity. Some of these limitations are: 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax expense (benefit) or the cash requirements to pay taxes; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 Although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 
 The expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically financed our operations primarily through funds generated from our capitation arrangements with payors, issuances of equity securities, and borrowings under credit agreements. We generally invest any excess cash in money market accounts, which are classified as cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our investment strategies are designed to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet the cash flow needs of our business operations, and attainment of a competitive return. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and equivalents of 153.8 million and investments in marketable securities of 244.8 million. 
 We expect to continue to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future due to the investments we intend to continue to make in expanding our business and additional general and administrative costs we expect to incur related to our operation as a public company. As a result, we may require additional capital resources in the future to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business. 
 Our primary uses of cash include payments for medical claims and other medical expenses, general and administrative expenses, costs associated with the development of new geographies and expansion of existing geographies, debt service, and capital expenditures. Final reconciliation and receipt of amounts due from payors are typically settled in arrears, following completion of the contractual program year. 
 Based on our planned operations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, as well as available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility (defined below), will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months, though we may require additional capital resources in the future. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 We may require additional financing in the future to fund working capital and pay our obligations. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings and/or debt financings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms when needed, we may be required to significantly reduce operating expenses, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 or other preferences that adversely affect our existing stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. 
 Our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock is significantly limited as a practical matter by our growth plans as well as the Credit Facility insofar as we may seek to pay dividends out of funds made available to us by agilon health management, inc. agilon management or its subsidiaries because the Credit Facility restricts agilon management s ability to pay dividends or make loans to us. The borrower on the Credit Facility is agilon management, our wholly-owned subsidiary. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries, including those identified as variable interest entities, and contain customary covenants including, among other things, limitations on restricted payments including: (i) dividends and distributions from restricted subsidiaries, (ii) requirements of minimum financial ratios, and (iii) limitation on additional borrowings based on certain financial ratios. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 25.1 million outstanding surety bonds related to health plan payor risk-bearing capital contributions. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table sets forth changes in cash flows (dollars in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (74,196) (95,033) 20,837 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 116,218 (41,816) 158,034 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (2,561) (192,288) 189,727 
 Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 74.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 95.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily as a result of the timing of settlements with payors from new and existing geographies. Our cash flow from operations is dependent upon the number of members on our platform, the timing of settlements with payors, and the level of operating and general and administrative expenses necessary to operate and grow our business, among other factors. 
 Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 116.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 41.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities of 154.8 million and made investments of 38.6 million primarily for the acquisition of intangible assets and property and equipment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we completed the acquisition of My Personal Health Record Express, Inc. for 44.4 million and made investments in marketable securities of 107.0 million, which were partially offset by proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities of 133.9 million. 
 Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 192.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 200.0 million to repurchase shares of our common stock in an underwritten secondary public offering. 
 Debt Obligations 
 On February 18, 2021, we executed a credit facility agreement (as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2021 and the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of May 25, 2023, the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility includes: (i) a 100.0 million senior secured term loan (the Secured Term Loan Facility and (ii) a 100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Secured Revolving Facility with a 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 capacity to issue standby letters of credit in certain circumstances up to a maximum of 100.0 million. Subject to specified conditions and receipt of commitments, the Secured Term Loan Facility may be expanded (or a new term loan facility, revolving credit facility or letter of credit facility added) by up to (i) 50.0 million plus (ii) an additional amount determined in accordance with a formula tied to repayment of certain of our indebtedness. The maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended to February 18, 2026. 
 Effective with the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement on May 25, 2023, we transitioned to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as a benchmark interest rate used in the Credit Agreement. At our option, borrowings under the Credit Facilities, as defined in the credit agreement, can be either: (i) SOFR Rate Loans, (ii) Daily Simple SOFR Rate Loans, or (iii) Base Rate Loans. Daily Simple SOFR Rate Loans and SOFR Rate Loans bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of 3.50 and the higher of (a) SOFR, as defined in the credit agreement, and (b) 0 . Base Rate Loans bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of 2.50 and the highest of: (a) 0.50 in excess of the overnight federal funds rate, (b) the prime rate established by the administrative agent from time to time, (c) the one-month SOFR rate (adjusted for maximum reserves) plus 1.00 and (d) 0 . Additionally, we pay a commitment fee on the unfunded 2021 Revolving Credit Facility amount of 0.375 . We must also pay customary letter of credit fees. 
 The Credit Facility contains customary covenants including, among other things, limitations on restricted payments including: (i) dividends and distributions from restricted subsidiaries, (ii) requirements of minimum financial ratios, and (iii) limitation on additional borrowings based on certain financial ratios. 
 For additional discussion on our debt obligations, see Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Equity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 412.0 million shares of common stock outstanding. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our equity transactions. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our historical experience, known trends and events, and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 in Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during 2024. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For the impact of new accounting standards, see Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business or for speculative or trading purposes. 
 Our exposures to market risk for changes in interest expense relate primarily to the Credit Facility. Indebtedness under the Credit Facility is floating rate debt and is carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 impact our consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on this debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our interest expense. 
 We held cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalents, and marketable securities of 398.6 million and 495.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, consisting of bank deposits, certificates of deposits, money market funds, U.S. Treasury notes, and corporate debt securities. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our marketable securities. Declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income. The goals of our investment policy are liquidity and capital preservation. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), with the assistance of other members of management, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this review, although we continue to work to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and progress has been made to date, our CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures related to this material weakness were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement. An evaluation of effectiveness is subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may decrease over time. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Under applicable SEC rules (Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d)), management is required to evaluate any change in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during each fiscal quarter that had materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 As explained in greater detail under Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we are undertaking a broad range of remedial procedures to address the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified as of December 31, 2023. Our efforts to improve our internal controls are ongoing. Therefore, while we determined, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, that there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, we continue to monitor the operation of these remedial measures through the date of this report.
