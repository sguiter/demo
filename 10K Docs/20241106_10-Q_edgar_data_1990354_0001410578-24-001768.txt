 -for-1 reverse stock split of our common stock and a -for-1 reverse stock split of our Class A common stock. The reverse stock split did not result in an adjustment to the par value of common stock or Class A common stock. The reverse stock split was originally made effective on May 15, 2024 with a -for-1 ratio and this was retroactively amended on May 22, 2024 which updated the ratio to -for-1. All references in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related Note 14, Note 16, and Note 18 have been updated to reflect the effects of the reverse stock split at the amended -for-1 ratio. The number of shares of common stock, Class A common stock, additional paid-in-capital, options to purchase common stock, and loss per share amounts, which are presented and disclosed in the financial statements and aforementioned footnotes, have been restated on a retroactive basis for all periods presented to reflect the effects of this action. Initial Public Offering In June 2024, we completed our initial public offering IPO in which we issued and sold shares of our common stock at per share. We received total proceeds of million after deducting the underwriters discounts and commissions of million. Deferred offering costs, which consist of direct incremental legal, accounting and other third-party fees that are directly related to the IPO, were capitalized and offset against proceeds upon the consummation of the IPO. Through the date of the IPO, we had capitalized million of deferred offering costs, of which million were unpaid as of September 30, 2024. These costs were offset against proceeds upon the consummation of the IPO. As part of the IPO we granted the underwriters an overallotment option, for a period of 30 days from the date of the prospectus, to purchase up to additional shares of common stock from us at the initial public offering price less the underwriting discount.

 additional shares of common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million. The remaining option to purchase additional shares expired unexercised at the end of the 30-day period. We used the net proceeds from the IPO and the underwriters exercise of the overallotment option on July 5, 2024, to repay million and million, respectively, of outstanding principal indebtedness under our First Lien Credit Facility. See Note 11 below for details. of total revenue for all periods presented. We also derive revenue from implementation fees for our software, as well as hardware sales to facilitate patient payments. We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ), through the following five steps: identification of the contract, or contracts, with a client; identification of the performance obligations in the contract; determination of the transaction price;

 and generally renew automatically for successive terms. Our revenue is reported net of applicable sales and use tax and is recognized as, or when, control of these services or products are transferred to clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the contract s performance obligations. Revenue from our subscription services as well as from our volume-based services represents a single promise to provide continuous access (i.e., a stand-ready obligation) to our software solutions in the form of a service. Our software products are made available to our clients via a cloud-based, hosted platform where our clients do not have the right or practical ability to take possession of the software. As each day of providing access to the software solutions is substantially the same and the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as services are provided, these services are viewed as a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct daily services. Revenue from our subscription services is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that the service is made available to the client. Volume-based services are priced based on transaction, dollar volume or provider count in a given period. Given the nature of the promise is based on unknown quantities or outcomes of services to be performed over the contract term, the volume-based fee is determined to be variable consideration. The volume-based transaction fees are recognized each day using a time- elapsed output method based on the volume or transaction count at the time the clients transactions are processed. Our other services are generally related to implementation activities across all solutions and hardware sales to facilitate patient payments. Implementation services are not considered performance obligations as they do not provide a distinct service to clients without the use of our software solutions. As such, implementation fees related to our solutions are billed upfront and recognized ratably over the contract term. Implementation fees and hardware sales represent less than of total revenue for all periods presented. Our contracts with clients typically include various combinations of our software solutions. Determining whether such software solutions are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together requires significant judgment. Specifically, judgment is required to determine whether access to the Company s SaaS solutions is distinct from other services and solutions included in an arrangement. We follow the requirements of ASC 606-10-55-36 through -40, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Principal Agent Considerations, in determining the gross versus net revenue presentations for our performance obligations in the contract with a client. Revenue recorded where we act in the capacity of a principal is reported on a gross basis equal to the full amount of consideration to which we expect in exchange for the good or service transferred. Revenue recorded where we act in the capacity of an agent is reported on a net basis, exclusive of any consideration provided to the principal party in the transaction. The principal versus agent evaluation is a matter of judgment that depends on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement and is dependent on whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the client or whether we are acting as an agent of a third party. This evaluation is performed separately for each performance obligation identified. For the majority of our contracts, we are considered the principal in the transaction with the client and recognize revenue gross of any related channel partner fees or costs. We have certain agency arrangements where third parties control the goods or services provided to a client and we recognize revenue net of any fees owed to these third parties. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although our standard payment terms generally require payment within to . In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of payment, we have determined our contracts do not generally include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide clients with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our clients or to provide clients with financing.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, amortization related to the sales commission asset was million and million, respectively.

Costs to Fulfill a Contract We capitalize costs incurred to fulfill contracts that i) relate directly to the contract, ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy performance obligations under the contract, and iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Costs incurred to implement clients on our solutions (e.g., direct labor) are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated customer life if we expect to recover those costs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total unamortized costs reported as deferred costs on our balance sheet amounted to million and million, respectively, for fulfillment costs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, amortization related to the fulfillment cost asset was million and million, respectively.

 Volume-based revenue Over time Implementation services and other revenue Various Total revenues Contract Liabilities We derive our revenue from contracts with clients primarily through subscription fees and volume-based fees. Our payment terms with the client generally comprise an initial payment for implementation services, which includes client enrollment and the setup of contracted solutions on our platform. These implementation fees are due upon contract execution. Additionally, subscription fees are earned on an ongoing basis, which are invoiced monthly. Client payments received in advance of fulfilling the corresponding performance obligations are recorded as contract liabilities. Implementation fees are recognized over the customer life, with any unrecognized amounts deferred as contract liabilities. These amounts are reported as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized ) ) Additional amounts deferred Ending balance Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations At September 30, 2024, the transaction price related to unsatisfied performance obligations that are expected to be recognized for the next and greater than was million and million, respectively. The transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) for executed contracts does not include revenue related to performance obligations that are part of a contract with an original expected duration of one year or less. Additionally, the balance does not include variable consideration that is allocated entirely to wholly unsatisfied promises that form part of a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct daily services.

Stock Options We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the service condition options under all plans and the Monte Carlo pricing model to estimate the fair value of the performance condition options under the 2019 Waystar Holding Corp. Plan. We value both types of options at the grant date using the following assumptions: Risk-free interest rate reflects the average rate on the United States Treasury bond with maturity equal to the expected term of the option; Expected dividend yield as we do not currently pay dividends or expect to pay dividends in the near future, the expected dividend yield is ; Expected term of stock award under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, we utilized the simplified method due to the lack of historical experience activity for our Company. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual expiration date of the award. Under the 2019 Waystar Holding Corp. Plan, it is based on historical experience that is modified based on expected future changes; Expected volatility in stock price reflects the historical volatility of comparable public companies over the expected term of the stock option.

In June 2024, we determined the vesting of all our performance condition options became probable as a result of the IPO (see Note 1). Therefore, we recognized an additional million of stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as the implicit service period for the awards established at the grant date had elapsed.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of Waystar Holding Corp. Waystar , the Company , we , us , and our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Prospectus. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors outside the Company s control, as well as assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described under the sections entitled Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements above and Risk factors in the Prospectus and our other filings with the SEC. Overview Waystar provides healthcare organizations with mission-critical cloud software that simplifies healthcare payments. Our enterprise-grade platform streamlines the complex and disparate processes our healthcare provider clients must manage to be reimbursed correctly, while improving the payments experience for providers, patients, and payers. We leverage AI as well as proprietary, advanced algorithms to automate payment-related workflow tasks and drive continuous improvement, which enhances claim and billing accuracy, enriches data integrity, and reduces labor costs for providers. Our software is used daily by providers of all types and sizes across the continuum of care, including physician practices, clinics, surgical centers, and laboratories, as well as large hospitals and health systems. We currently serve over 30,000 clients of various sizes, representing over one million distinct providers practicing across a variety of care sites, including 18 of the top 22 U.S. News Best Hospitals. Our business model is designed such that as our clients grow to serve more patients, their claims and transactional volumes increase, resulting in corresponding growth in our business. In addition, our clients frequently adopt a greater number of our solutions over time and introduce our solutions across new sites of care. In 2023, we facilitated over five billion healthcare payments transactions, including over 1.2 trillion in gross claims volume, spanning approximately 50 of patients in the United States. Our platform benefits from powerful network effects. Our cloud-based software is driven by a sophisticated, automated, and curated rules engine, employing AI to generate and incorporate real-time feedback from millions of network transactions processed through our platform each day. Every transaction we process provides additional data insights across providers, patients, and payers, which are embedded in updates that are deployed efficiently across our client base. This results in cumulative benefits to us over time as we capture more data from each transaction we process, we leverage that data to continue to improve the Waystar platform through embedded machine learning, advanced algorithms, and other in-house AI technologies to deliver added value to our clients. In turn, the more value we create for our clients, the more likely it is that they will continue to use our products, allowing us to continue to capture more data that results in tangible improvements to our platform. As a result, our clients benefit from faster and more efficient performance from software that is evolving to meet ever-changing regulatory and payer requirements, enabling accurate and timely reimbursement. We have demonstrated an ability to drive recurring, predictable, and profitable growth. Over 99 of our revenue is either recurring subscription or based on highly predictable volumes. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, our Net Revenue Retention Rate was 109.4 and we have 1,173 clients as of September 30, 2024 generating over 100,000 over the same twelve month period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenue of 699.4 million (reflecting a 19.7 increase compared to revenue of 584.3 million for the same period in the prior year), net loss of 38.2 million (reflecting a 3.5 increase to net loss compared to net loss of 36.9 million for the same period in the prior year), and Adjusted EBITDA of 283.3 million (reflecting a 14.5 increase compared to Adjusted EBITDA of 247.5 million for the same period in the prior year). Initial Public Offering In June 2024, we completed an initial public offering (the IPO of 45,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of 21.50 per share. After underwriting discounts and commissions of 53.2 million, we received total proceeds from the offering of 914.3 million. On July 5, 2024, pursuant to the option granted to the underwriters for a period of 30 days from the date of the Prospectus to purchase up to 6,750,000 additional shares of common stock from us at the IPO price less the underwriting discount, the underwriters exercised the right to purchase 5,059,010 additional shares of common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of 102.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of 6.0 million. The remaining option to purchase additional shares expired unexercised at the end of the 30-day period. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 1 (Business) for more information.

 Significant Items Affecting Comparability We believe that the future growth and profitability of our business, and the comparability of our results from period to period, depend on numerous factors, including the following: Our Ability to Expand our Relationship with Existing Clients As our clients grow their businesses and provide more services and see more patients, our volume-based revenues also increase. In addition, our growth in revenues also depends on our ability to sell more products and solutions to existing clients, including through cross-selling as our clients adopt additional Waystar offerings as well as up-selling as our clients leverage our solutions across additional providers and sites of care. Our Ability to Grow our Client Base We are focused on continuing to grow our client base, which will depend in part on our ability to continue to maintain our product leadership, invest in our research and development team, and maintain our reputation and brand. Timing and Number of Acquisitions Since 2018, we have completed and successfully integrated nine acquisitions, two of which closed in the second half of 2023; HealthPay24 on August 3, 2023; and certain assets of Olive AI, Inc. s Clearinghouse and Patient Access business on October 31, 2023. The historical results of operations of our acquisitions are only included starting from the date of closing of such acquisition. As a result, our consolidated statements of operations for any given period during which an acquisition closed may not be comparable to future periods, which would include the results of operations of such acquisition for the entirety of such future period. Impacts of Our Competitor s Cybersecurity Attack Following the February 2024 cybersecurity incident involving one of our competitors, more than 30,000 providers, including a significant number of large health systems and ambulatory providers, began adopting our solutions, and we were able to implement our solutions for many of these new clients in as little as 48 hours. This incident and our response to it generated approximately 12 million and 22 million, respectively, in additional revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased win rates above our historically competitive rates and associated accelerated implementation timeline. Impacts of the IPO Debt Repayment. In connection with the closing of the IPO, we repaid 909.1 million outstanding principal amount and 2.8 million accrued interest on our First Lien Credit Facility and incurred debt extinguishment costs of 9.8 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. On July 12, 2024, we utilized the additional proceeds from the underwriters exercise of the overallotment option, as well as cash on hand, to repay 110.9 million outstanding principal and 0.4 million accrued interest on our First Lien Credit Facility. The debt repayments will result in lower interest expense moving forward, partially offset by losses on extinguishment of debt in the period the debt repayment is made. Stock-Based Compensation Expenses. We expect to recognize stock-based compensation expense of 17.9 million per year over the applicable vesting periods in connection with equity awards granted in connection with the IPO. Such stock-based compensation expense will be reflected in our results of operations from the closing date of the IPO through the applicable vesting periods of such awards. Additionally, we recognized a 33.1 million of stock-based compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as the vesting of our performance condition options became probable upon the closing of the IPO as the implicit service period for the awards established at the grant date had elapsed. Incremental Public Company Expenses. Following the IPO, we will have begun to incur significant expenses on an ongoing basis that we did not incur as a private company. Those costs include additional director and officer liability insurance expenses, as well as third-party and internal resources related to accounting, auditing, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, legal, and investor and public relation expenses. These costs will generally be expensed under general and administrative expenses.

 Components of Results of Operations Revenue We primarily generate two types of revenue: (i) subscription revenue and (ii) volume-based revenue, which account for 99 of total revenue for all periods presented. We believe we have high visibility into our volume-based and subscription revenue from existing clients. We refer to the solutions our clients use to better process and understand their payment workflows from payers as provider solutions, and we refer to the products that assist healthcare providers in collecting payments from patients as patient payment solutions. We expect provider solutions will continue to generate the substantial majority of our total revenue, although the revenue mix attributable to patient payment solutions is expected to increase slightly over time. Subscription revenue . Reflects recurring monthly provider count fees and minimum amounts owed. The vast majority of subscription revenue is generated by provider solutions, which constituted approximately 70 of total revenue in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Volume-based revenue . Represents recurring fees associated with transaction count or dollar volumes in excess of minimums. Generally, approximately half of our volume-based revenue is generated from provider solutions that are based on transaction count, with the other half from patient payments solutions that are based on either dollar volumes or transaction count. 
 We also derive revenue from implementation fees for our software, as well as hardware sales to facilitate patient payments. Our implementation fees are billed upfront and the revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. Cost of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) Cost of revenue includes salaries, stock-based compensation, and benefits personnel costs for our team members who are focused on implementation, support, and other client-focused operations, as well as team members focused on enhancing and developing our platform. Cost of revenue also includes costs for third-party technology such as interchange fees and infrastructure related to the operations of our platform, including communicating and processing patient payments, and services to support the delivery of our solutions. Third-party costs for patient payments solutions are approximately 60 of the revenue generated from these solutions, while third-party costs for provider solutions are approximately 6 to 8 of the associated revenue, in each case, for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing costs consist primarily of personnel costs, internal sales commissions, channel partner fees, travel, and advertising costs. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs incurred in our corporate service functions such as finance expenses, legal, human resources, and information technology, as well as other professional service costs. Research and Development Research and development R D costs consist primarily of personnel costs for team members engaged in research and development activities as well as third-party fees. All such costs are expensed as incurred, except for capitalized software development costs. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization consists of the depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of certain intangible assets, including capitalized software. Other Expense Other expense consists primarily of interest expense and related-party interest expense, inclusive of the impact of interest rate swaps.

 Income Tax Benefit Income tax benefit includes current income tax and income tax credits from deferred taxes. Income tax benefit is recognized in profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the income tax expense is also recognized in equity or other comprehensive income.

Another 26.3 million was attributed to volume-based revenue primarily related to expansion of existing client usage and acquired clients, of which 10.3 million was generated by provider solutions and 16.0 million by patient payments solutions. Included within the revenue increases over the period is an estimated 12 million increase due to our heightened win rates above our historically high rates and accelerated implementation timelines related to the cybersecurity incident involving one of our competitors in February 2024. Cost of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) Cost of revenue was 80.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 62.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 17.6 million, or 28.0 . The increase was primarily driven by 14.6 million in increased costs stemming from higher transaction volume and associated third-party costs, including higher platform usage, of which approximately 3.7 million was from costs associated with provider solutions and 10.9 million from patient payments solutions. In addition, there was a 1.9 million increase in personnel costs.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures We present adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss), and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and capital investments. Management uses these to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish discretionary annual incentive compensation, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone provide.

 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income / (loss), and non-GAAP net income / (loss) per share are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or net income (loss) margin as measures of financial performance or cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these measures are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments, and debt service requirements. The presentations of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company. A reconciliation is provided below for our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest expense, net, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, and as further adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration costs, asset and lease impairments, costs related to amended debt agreements, and IPO related costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA and net loss margin to adjusted EBITDA margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 (a) Adjustments relate to additional lease costs due to the relocation of our Louisville office. Non-GAAP Net Income / (Loss) and Non-GAAP Net Income / (Loss) Per Share We define non-GAAP net income as GAAP net income excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration costs, asset and lease impairments, IPO related costs, and costs related to amended debt agreements. The tax effects of the adjustments are calculated using a management estimated annual effective non-GAAP tax rate of 21 . Non-GAAP net income / (loss) per share is shown on both a basic and diluted basis and is defined as non-GAAP net income / (loss) divided by the basic or diluted weighted-average shares, respectively.

Key Performance Metrics Net Revenue Retention Rate We also regularly monitor and review our Net Revenue Retention Rate. The following table presents our Net Revenue Retention Rate for September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively: 

Twelve months ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 Net Revenue Retention Rate 109.4 109.0 Our Net Revenue Retention Rate compares twelve months of client invoices for our solutions at two period end dates. To calculate our Net Revenue Retention Rate, we first accumulate the total amount invoiced during the twelve months ending with the prior period-end, or Prior Period Invoices. We then calculate the total amount invoiced to those same clients for the twelve months ending with the current period-end, or Current Period Invoices. Current Period Invoices are inclusive of upsell, downsell, pricing changes, clients that cancel or chose not to renew, and discontinued solutions with continuing clients. The Net Revenue Retention Rate is then calculated by dividing the Current Period Invoices by the Prior Period Invoices. Our total invoices included in the analysis are greater than 98 of reported revenue. We use Net Revenue Retention Rate to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Acquired businesses are included in the last-twelve month Net Revenue Retention Rate in the ninth quarter after acquisition, which is the earliest point that comparable post-acquisition invoices are available for both the current and prior twelve-month period. Customer Count with > 100,000 Revenue We also regularly monitor and review our count of clients who generate more than 100,000 of revenue. The following table sets forth our count of clients who generate more than 100,000 of revenue for the periods presented: 

September 30, September 30, (For the 12 month period ended) 2024 2023 Customer Count with > 100,000 Revenue 1,173 1,033 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 Our count of clients who generate more than 100,000 of revenue is based on an accumulation of the amounts invoiced to clients over the preceding twelve months. The invoices for acquired clients are included starting in the first full calendar quarter after the date of acquisition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet current and future needs. Our expected primary uses on a short-term and long-term basis are for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, and investments in future growth, including acquisitions. We have historically funded our operations and acquisitions through our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and debt financings. We believe that our existing unrestricted cash on hand, expected future cash flows from operations, and additional borrowings will provide sufficient resources to fund our operating requirements, as well as future capital expenditures, debt service requirements, and investments in future growth for at least the next 12 months. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings, or a combination of these potential sources of funds. In the event that we need access to additional cash, we may not be able to access the credit markets on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to fund future operating expenses and capital expenditures and our ability to meet future debt service obligations or refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, and other factors beyond our control, including those described under Risk factors in the Prospectus. On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had restricted cash of 17.2 million and 9.8 million, respectively, which consists of cash deposited in lockbox accounts owned by us which are contractually required to be disbursed to participating clients on the following day, as well as cash collected on behalf of healthcare providers from patients that have not yet been remitted to providers. These funds payable are not available for our use and liquidity, and are offset on our balance sheet by an aggregated funds payable liability. Our liquidity is influenced by many factors, including timing of revenue and corresponding cash collections, the amount and timing of investments in strategic initiatives, our investments in property, equipment, and software, as well as other factors described under Risk factors in the Prospectus. Depending on the severity and direct impact of these factors on us, we may not be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all. Cash Flows Cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, are summarized in the following table: 

Nine months ended September 30, Change in thousands) 2024 2023 Amount Change Net cash provided by operating activities 104,998 40,004 64,994 162.5 Net cash used by investing activities (21,044) (45,753) 24,709 NM Net cash provided/ (used) by financing activities 14,965 (14,032) 28,997 NM Net increase in cash and restricted cash 98,919 (19,781) 118,700 NM Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities were 105.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 40.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is largely driven by the changes in working capital, increases in revenue and profits, and decreases in the cash paid for interest due to the multiple paydowns on our First Lien Credit Facility in 2024. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities were 21.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 45.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased due to the 30.0 million of cash used in the 2023 acquisition of HealthPay24.

 Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities were 15.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cash flows used of 14.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the proceeds from our IPO net of third-party IPO issuance costs (see Note 1 in Financial Statements), as well as the issuance of debt, net of creditor fees (see Note 11 in Financial Statements). These increases were offset by increased payments on our debt compared to the prior period (see Note 11 in Financial Statements). Indebtedness Refer to Item 1, Financial Statements, Notes 9 (Accounts Receivable Securitization) and 10 (Debt), for a description of our Credit Facilities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that we consider to be the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of judgments by management. Judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in the Prospectus. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 2 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). JOBS Act Election We are currently an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business. Such risks are principally associated with credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit Risk Credit risk involves the possibility that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or client contract, leading to a financial loss. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to our clients are limited due to our diversified client base. We routinely assess the financial strength of our clients through a combination of third-party financial reports, credit monitoring, publicly available information, and direct communication with those clients. We establish payment terms with clients to mitigate credit risk and monitor its accounts receivable credit risk exposure. However, while we actively seek to ensure credit risk, there can be no assurance that in the future it will be able to obtain credit risk insurance at commercially attractive terms or at all.

Table of Contents 
 Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk is related to our First Lien Credit Facility, which bears interest at SOFR plus 2.75 as of September 30, 2024. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in the current effective rate would have an impact on our interest expense of approximately 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In order to limit exposure to risk, we maintain derivative instruments with creditworthy institutions to hedge against changing interest rate fluctuations. We utilize interest rate swap contracts and other non-derivative hedging instruments to manage such risk. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II - Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings The information required with respect to this Part II, Item 1 can be found under Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 19 (Commitments and Contingencies), to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Prospectus . Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchase of Securities None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information (a) On November 4, 2024, a sub-committee of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the outstanding option awards granted to our executive officers, including each of our named executive officers, under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the Amendment ). The Amendment modifies the alternative vesting terms pursuant to which performance-vesting options may vest following the 18-month anniversary of our initial public offering (the IPO ).
 
 Specifically, the Amendment provides that, from and after the date of the first trading window that commences after the 18-month anniversary of the IPO through the final measurement date, the performance-vesting options will be eligible to vest upon the first day of each trading window (each, an Open Window Commencement Date ), subject to the participant s continued employment through such date, based on the achievement of the following performance hurdles (the Alternative Performance Hurdles ): 1. The performance-vesting stock options will begin to vest when and if the volume-weighted average share price of our common stock over the 20-trading day period (the 20-Day VWAP ending as of such Open Window Commencement Date is at least 24.81 (which represents the share price that would imply a 1.5x multiple on our sponsors collective investment in the Company). 2. 100 of the performance-vesting stock options will vest when and if the 20-Day VWAP as of such Open Window Commencement Date is at least 41.35 (which represents the share price that would imply a 2.5x multiple on our sponsors collective investment in the Company). 3. To the extent the 20-Day VWAP as of such Open Window Commencement Date is between 24.81 and 41.35, the performance-vesting stock options will vest based on linear interpolation. The Amendment provides that the number of performance-vesting options that vest on each such Open Window Commencement Date will be reduced by the number of performance-vesting options that have previously vested prior to such Open Window Commencement Date. The Alternative Performance Hurdles replace the provisions in place prior to the Amendment that would have treated the 20-Day VWAP as of an Open Window Commencement Date following the 18-month anniversary of the IPO as deemed cash proceeds for purposes of determining the achievement of the sponsor multiple of investment performance vesting objectives. The Amendment is not expected to have a material impact to the financial statements.
