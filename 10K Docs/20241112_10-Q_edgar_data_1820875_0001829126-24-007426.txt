CXAPP INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

thousand and cash and cash equivalents of approximately 
thousand. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), the Company incurred net losses of approximately 
thousand and thousand, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), the Company used approximately
 
thousand of cash for operating activities. 

The Company acknowledges that there are challenges
in generating sufficient revenue to fully support its operations and achieving long-term profitability. The Company s recurring
losses and cash usage in operations have raised concerns about its ability to continue as a going concern. Given the current liquidity
position, management has taken several strategic measures to improve operational efficiency and strengthen the financial outlook. These
initiatives include streamlining operations through workforce reductions, renegotiating contractual agreements, adjusting professional
service fees, and optimizing expenses such as software licenses and contractor-related costs. Additionally, the Company has made progress
in forming strategic partnerships such as the addition of its platform to key marketplaces and has successfully negotiated cost reductions
in areas such as insurance premiums. Management believes that these actions will contribute to improved operational efficiency and long-term
financial stability. However with the current liquidity position, management has implemented the following strategic measures to improve
operational efficiency and strengthen the financial outlook: 

In January 2024, the Company streamlined its operations to conserve cash resources by laying off approximately 20 of the global employee headcount; 

In March 2024, the Company successfully negotiated for a
50 reduction in D O insurance premium; and 

In August 2024, Google added the CXAI application platform to the Google Marketplace and signed a go-to-market partnership agreement.
Google Cloud s sales and marketing teams will work with CXAI on targeting key clients and providing them the best workplace platform
experience. With this, the Management believes that this partnership would help boost the Company s product capability revenue. 

These steps, along with anticipated revenue growth
from organic sales and other partnerships, provide the Company with the necessary resources to support operations mitigating liquidity
risk. 

On May 22, 2024, the 

Management believes that the recent funding initiatives
provide sufficient capital to address any potential uncertainties regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
This funding ensures that the Company is well-positioned to meet its obligations and continue operations for at least the next twelve
months from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. If additional funding is required, the Management
is confident in its ability to secure financing, as necessary. The Company has access to multiple funding sources and expects these to
be sufficient for its strategic needs. 

Looking beyond this period, the Company is focused
on executing its business plan and exploring additional strategic initiatives to enhance liquidity and support long-term growth. While
the ability to continue as a going concern depends on various factors, including the successful implementation of these plans and market
conditions, management remains optimistic about the Company s long-term prospects and its capacity to adapt and thrive in a dynamic
market environment. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, reflecting the Company s expectation to realize its assets and
meet its liabilities in the ordinary course of business. No adjustments have been made to the financial statements regarding the recoverability
or classification of recorded asset amounts or liabilities, as the Company believes it will effectively manage the uncertainties described
above.

to years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the useful life of the asset or the initial lease term, whichever is shorter. Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the economic useful life of the related assets, are charged to operations as incurred,
and expenditures, which extend the economic life, are capitalized. When assets are retired, or otherwise disposed, the costs and related
accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss on disposal is recognized.

the carrying amount of the assets. Based on its assessments, the Company did not incur any impairment charges for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), for the period from March 15, 2023 to

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard s core principle is that an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard is a principles-based standard intended to better match the accounting for the transaction with the economics of the transaction. This requires entities to use more judgment and make more estimates than under previous revenue standards. 

The standard introduces a five-step model for revenue recognition that replaces the four criteria for revenue recognition under previous GAAP. The five steps are shown below: 

1. 
 Identify the contract with a customer; 

2. 
 Identify the performance obligations in the contract; 

3. 
 Determine the transaction price; 

4. 
 Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations; and 

5. 
 Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation 

License Subscription Revenue Recognition (Software As A Service) 

With respect to sales of the Company s license agreements, customers generally pay fixed annual fees in advance in exchange for the Company s software service provided via electronic means, which are generally recognized ratably over the license term. Some agreements allow the customer to terminate their subscription contracts before the end of the applicable term, and in such cases the customer is generally entitled to a refund pro-rata but only for the elapsed time remaining at the point of termination, which would approximate the deferred revenue at such time. The Company s performance obligation is satisfied over time as the electronic services are provided continuously throughout the service period. The Company recognizes revenue evenly over the service period using a time-based measure because the Company is providing continuous access to its service. The Company s customers generally pay within 30 to 60 days from the receipt of a customer approved invoice. 

The timing of the Company s revenue recognition related to the licensing revenue stream is dependent on whether the software licensing agreement entered into represents a service. Software that relies on an entity s IP and is delivered only through a hosting arrangement, where the customer cannot take possession of the software, is a service. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. 

Renewals or extensions of licenses are evaluated as distinct licenses and revenue attributed to the distinct service is not recognized until: (1) the entity provides the distinct license (or makes the license available) to the customer and (2) the customer is able to use and benefit from the distinct license. Renewal contracts are not combined with original contracts, and, as a result, the renewal right is evaluated in the same manner as all other additional rights granted after the initial contract. The revenue is not recognized until the customer can begin to use and benefit from the license, which is typically at the beginning of the license renewal period. The Company recognizes revenue resulting from renewal of licensed software over time. 

Professional Services Revenue Recognition 

The Company provides integration and software customization professional services to its customers. 

Professional services under milestone contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method. As soon as the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognized in the statement of operations in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Contract costs are expensed as incurred. Contract costs include all amounts that relate directly to the specific contract, are attributable to contract activity, and are specifically chargeable to the customer under the terms of the contract. 

Professional services are also contracted on the
fixed fee and in some cases on a time and materials basis. Fixed fees are paid monthly, in phases, or upon acceptance of deliverables.
The Company s time and materials contracts are paid weekly or monthly based on hours worked. Revenue on time and material contracts
is recognized based on a fixed hourly rate as direct labor hours are expended. Materials, or other specified direct costs, are reimbursed
as actual costs and may include markup. The Company has elected the practical expedient to recognize revenue for the right to invoice
because the Company s right to consideration corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance completed to
date. For fixed fee contracts provided by in-house personnel, the Company recognizes revenue evenly over the service period using a time-based
measure because the Company is providing continuous service. Because the Company s contracts have an expected duration of one year
or less, the Company has elected the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) to not disclose information about its remaining performance
obligations. Anticipated losses are recognized as soon as they become known. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 (Successor), for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), for the period from March 15, 2023 to September 30, 2023
(Successor), and the period from January 1, 2023 to March 14, 2023 (Predecessor), the Company did not incur any such losses. These amounts
are based on known and estimated factors. 

Hardware
Revenue Recognition 

For sales of hardware, the Company s performance
obligation is fulfilled when the products are shipped to the customer, transferring title and ownership risks. Deliveries occur via drop-shipment
by a third-party vendor and the Company leverages drop-ship arrangements with many of its vendors and suppliers to deliver products to
customers without having to physically hold the inventory at its warehouse. The Company negotiates sale prices, pays suppliers directly,
manages credit risk, and ensures product acceptability, acting as the principal in the transaction and recording revenue on a gross basis.
Customers typically pay within 30 to 60 days of invoice receipt. The Company has elected the practical expedient to expense the costs
of obtaining a contract when they are incurred because the amortization period of the asset that otherwise would have been recognized
is less than a year. 

Contract Balances 

The timing of the Company s revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to and payment by its customers. The Company
records an unbilled receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing and the Company has an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively,
when invoicing a customer precedes the Company providing of the related services, the Company records deferred revenue until the performance
obligations are satisfied. The Company had deferred revenue of approximately thousand and thousand as of September 30, 2024 (Successor) and December 31, 2023 (Successor), respectively, related to customer invoices rendered in
advance for software licenses, professional services, and hardware provided by the Company s technical staff. 

The Company expects to satisfy its remaining performance obligations for the deferred revenue associated with hardware, professional services,
and recognize the deferred revenue related to licenses generally over the remaining contract term which is generally twelve months following
the commencement of the license. The Company recognized revenue in the reporting period of thousand, thousand, and thousand, that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period, for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 (Successor), for the period from March 15, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor), and for the period from January 1, 2023 to March
14, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively. 

Costs to Obtain a Contract 

The Company recognizes eligible sales commissions as an asset within prepaid expenses and other current assets as the commissions are an incremental cost of obtaining a contract with the customer and the Company expects to recover these costs. The capitalized costs are amortized over the expected contract term. 

Cost to Fulfill a Contract 

The Company incurs costs to fulfill their obligations under a contract once it has obtained the contract. These costs are generally not significant and are recorded to expense as incurred. 

Multiple Performance Obligations 

The Company enters into contracts with customers for its technology that include multiple performance obligations. Each distinct performance obligation was determined by whether the customer could benefit from the good or service on its own or together with readily available resources. The Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company s process for determining standalone selling price considers multiple factors including the Company s internal pricing model and market trends that may vary depending upon the facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. 

Sales and Use Taxes 

The Company presents transactional taxes such as sales and use tax collected from customers and remitted to government authorities on a net basis. 

Shipping and Handling Costs 

Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as part of cost of revenues. These costs were deemed to be de minimis during each of the reporting periods.

The Company accounts for its public and private warrants as a derivative liability initially measured at its fair values and remeasured in the condensed consolidated statements of operations at the end of each reporting period. When the warrants are exercised, the corresponding derivative liability is de-recognized at the underlying fair value of the Class A common stock that is issued to the warrant holder less any cash paid in accordance with the warrant agreement. Upon either cash or cashless exercise, the de-recognized derivative liability results in an increase in additional paid in capital equal to the difference between the fair value of the underlying Class A common stock and its par value. A cashless exercise results in the warrant holder surrendering Class A common stock equal to the stated warrant exercise price based on the contractual terms in the warrant agreement that governs the cashless conversion.

The Company considers the following to be some examples of such events or changes in circumstances that may trigger an impairment review: (a) significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset (asset group); (b) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition; (c) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset (asset group), including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (d) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset (asset group); (e) a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset (asset group); and (f) a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The Company tests its long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events. 

Based on its assessments, the Company recorded 
impairment charges on long-lived assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), for the period from March

Litigation 

Certain conditions may exist as of the date the
condensed consolidated financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved
when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment
inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against
the Company, or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal
proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought
therein. 

If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. 

Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed, unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. There can be no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.

Stockholder Quorum Requirement 

On November 8, 2024, the The Board approved the reduction because it had found it exceedingly difficult to satisfy our
former quorum requirement, which is necessary to constitute a valid and duly called meeting of our stockholders. The foregoing description
of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by,
the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, with the audited condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on May 24, 2024 (the Annual Report ). References in this report (the Quarterly Report to we , us or the Company refer to CXApp Inc. References to our management or our management team refer to our officers and directors. The following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes the principal factors affecting the results of our operations, financial condition, and changes in financial condition for the period ended September 30, 2024. 

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q including, without limitation, statements in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the Company s financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as expect, believe, anticipate, intend, estimate, seek and variations and similar words and expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance, but reflect management s current beliefs, based on information currently available. A number of factors could cause actual events, performance or results to differ materially from the events, performance and results discussed in the forward-looking statements. For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Risk Factors section of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). The Company s securities filings can be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Overview of Our Business 

The CXApp SaaS platform offers a suite of leading-edge technology workplace experience solutions including an enterprise employee application, indoor mapping, on-device positioning, augmented reality technologies and an AI-based analytics platform, targeting the emerging hybrid workplace market to provide enhanced experiences across people, places, and things. 

CXApp creates a connected workplace by reducing app overload, data fragmentation, and complex workflows and streamlines all capabilities through our application platform. All features, services, and integrations are housed in one easy-to-access platform allowing businesses to deliver a more holistic employee experience in a hybrid workplace. 

Prior to the closing of the Business Combination, CXApp and subsidiaries were wholly-owned subsidiary of Inpixon Inpixon and the Company s financial statements consist of CXApp US, CXApp Canada, and CXApp Philippines (collectively the Company, we, us or our ), show the historical condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes thereto. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows would have been had the Company been a separate entity nor are they indicative of future results of the Company. 

The condensed consolidated operating results of the Company have been specifically identified based on the Company s existing divisional organization. The majority of the assets and liabilities of the Company have been identified based on the existing divisional structure. The historical costs and expenses reflected in the Company s financial statements include an allocation for certain corporate and shared service functions. Management believes the assumptions underlying our condensed consolidated financial statements are reasonable. Nevertheless, our condensed consolidated financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred and may not reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows had we operated as a standalone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if we had operated as a standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. We also may incur additional costs associated with being a standalone, publicly listed company that were not included in the expense allocations and, therefore, would result in additional costs that are not reflected in our historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Revenues 

Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased to 1,897 thousand, reflecting a 7 quarter-over-quarter growth, driven by the successful onboarding of new enterprise clients and deeper integration of our platform solutions with existing customers. This sustained revenue increase highlights the growing demand for our hybrid workplace solutions, particularly with our strategic partnerships, such as our collaboration with Google Cloud Marketplace, which we anticipate will significantly accelerate adoption and customer retention. Looking ahead, we expect this momentum to continue as we expand our presence in key markets and leverage our unique AI-based workplace experience technologies. 

Our subscription-based revenue was 87 of the total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) and 80 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), which is a 7 increase in the revenue mix because the Company has moved to a full SaaS model versus one-time professional fees. 

Gross Margin 

Cost of revenues includes the direct costs to deliver the services including labor and overhead. Cost of revenues were 372 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), compared to 358 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor). The gross profit margin was 80 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), compared to 80 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor). 

33 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses consist primarily of research and development costs, sales and marketing costs, and general and administrative costs. These operating expenses were 4,851 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), compared to 5,641 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor). The decrease in operating expenses of 790 thousand for the same comparative period was attributable to decrease in sales and marketing expenses of 446 thousand, other general and administrative expenses of 329 thousand, research and development expenses of 121 thousand, professional fees through issuance of the Company s Class A Common Stock amounting to 106 thousand, acquisition related costs of 30 thousand, amortization of intangibles of 14 thousand, and increase in stock-based compensation expense of 256 thousand. 

Other Income/(Expense) 

Other income/expense was 1,825 thousand expense, and 5,253 thousand income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) and the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), respectively. This decrease of 7,078 thousand in other expense for the same comparative periods was attributable to the decrease in changes in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of approximately 6,272 thousand, loss on debt extinguishment of approximately 535 thousand and increase in interest expense of approximately 369 thousand and increase in other income of approximately 98 thousand. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

There was an income tax benefit of approximately 147 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), compared to 417 thousand tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor). The income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) is primarily a result of the release of valuation allowance attributable to acquired intangible assets from the Business Combination recorded in the first quarter of 2023. 

Comparison of the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), period ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), and period ended March 14, 2023 (Predecessor)

Revenues 

The Company derives revenue from subscription software as a service (SaaS), design, deployment and implementation services for its enterprise apps business. Revenue was 5,481 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), compared to 4,027 thousand and 1,620 thousand for the period ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the period ended March 14, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively. The decrease in revenue of 166 thousand, for the comparative periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was due to a decline in Professional Services revenue. Professional services are related to integration works and other services that may be requested by the customer and as such the decline in revenue is attributable to the professional services revenue because the Company has moved to a full SaaS model versus one-time professional fees. 

Our subscription-based revenue was 87 of the total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), 79 for the period ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), and 74 for the period ended March 14, 2023 (Predecessor), which is an 8 increase in the revenue mix. 

Gross Margin 

Cost of revenues includes the direct costs to deliver the services including labor and overhead. Cost of revenues was 1,052 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), compared to 925 thousand and 483 thousand for the period ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the period ended March 14, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively. The gross profit margin was 81 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), compared to 77 and 70 for the period ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the period ended March 14, 2023 (Predecessor). This decrease in cost of revenues of approximately 356 thousand, or approximately 25 , for the comparative periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was attributable to the decrease in professional services revenue related costs. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses consist primarily of research and development costs, sales and marketing costs, and general and administrative costs. These operating expenses were 14,992 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), compared to 11,501 thousand and 5,518 thousand for the period ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the period ended March 14, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively. 

The decrease in operating expenses of 2,027 thousand for the same comparative period was attributable to decrease in acquisition cost of approximately 194 thousand, general and administrative expenses of 840 thousand due to non-renewal of contract with contractors and reduction of D O insurance premium, sales and marketing expenses of 706 thousand due to change in commission plan and employee restructuring effective in January 2024, research and development of approximately 20 thousand and amortization of intangibles of 267 thousand. 

Other Income/(Expense) 

Other income/expense was 5,380 thousand expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), and 5,090 thousand expense and 1 thousand income for the period ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the period ended March 14, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively. This increase in other expense of 291 thousand for the same comparative period was attributable to decrease in changes in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of 1,559 thousand and the increase in interest expense of approximately 1,320 thousand was primarily attributable to the one-time monitoring fee relating to the Promissory Note issued on December 15, 2023 and convertible debt, loss on debt extinguishment of 535 thousand and decrease in foreign exchange loss of approximately 5 thousand. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

There was an income tax benefit of approximately 513 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), compared to 2,958 thousand tax benefit for the period ended September 30, 2023 (Successor). The income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) is primarily a result of the release of valuation allowance attributable to acquired intangible assets from the Business Combination recorded in the first quarter of 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial information 

EBITDA 

The Company includes a non-GAAP measure that we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and other income, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management as the matrix in which it manages the business. It is defined as EBITDA plus adjustments for other income or expense items, non- recurring items and non-cash stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we believe is useful to investors and analysts because it illustrates the underlying financial and business trends relating to our core, recurring results of operations and enhances comparability between periods. 

Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and is not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry. Investors should exercise caution in comparing our non-GAAP measure to any similarly titled measure used by other companies. 

This non-GAAP measure excludes certain items required by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to information reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The table below presents our adjusted EBITDA, reconciled to net income, which is the most comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated (in thousands).

We rely on Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure for the following: 

To compare our current operating results with corresponding periods and with the operating results of other companies in our industry 

As a basis for allocating resources to various projects 

As a measure to evaluate potential economic outcomes of acquisitions, operational alternatives and strategic decisions and 

To evaluate internally the performance of our personnel. 

36 

We have presented Adjusted EBITDA above because we believe it conveys useful information to investors regarding our operating results. We believe it provides an additional way for investors to view our operations, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to net income (loss). By including this information, we can provide investors with a more complete understanding of our business. Specifically, we present Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental disclosure because of the following: 

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance of our business without the effect of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and other non- cash items including acquisition transaction and financing costs, impairment, unrealized gains, stock based compensation, interest income and expense, and income tax benefit. 

We believe that it is useful to provide to investors with a standard operating metric used by management to evaluate our operating performance and 

We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to compare our results to other companies. 

Even though we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors, it does have limitations as an analytical tool. Thus, we strongly urge investors not to consider this metric in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) and the other condensed consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include the fact that: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt 

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income or other taxes or the cash requirements to make any tax payments and 

Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, thereby potentially limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of performance in compliance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and providing Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental information. 

Financing Obligations and Requirements 

As of November 12, 2024, the Company owed
approximately 2,731 thousand in principal and accrued interest payable of 20 thousand payable within the next three months related to
the December 2023 Note. The interest rate is 10 . See Note 9 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net cash used in operating activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) of 4,629 thousand consists of net loss of 15,430 thousand offset by non-cash
adjustments of approximately 9,826 thousand and net cash changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 975 thousand.
On May 22, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA with Streeterville Capital, LLC Lender ), pursuant to which the Lender desires to purchase up to 10,000 thousand in shares of the Company s Common
Stock, par value 0.0001. Pursuant to the SPA, the Company issued two unsecured convertible Pre-Paid Purchases to Lender. The convertible
Pre-Paid Purchases has the original principal amount of 3,675 thousand. For the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company received
net proceeds of 3,480 thousand, reflecting original issue discount of 175 and Lender s transaction cost of 20 thousand. Given
our current cash balances and budgeted cash flow requirements, the Company believes such funds are sufficient to satisfy its working
capital needs, capital asset purchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations for
the next 12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements. The Company may continue to pursue strategic transactions and
may raise additional capital as needed, using our equity securities and/or cash and debt financings in combinations appropriate for each
acquisition. 

37 

Liquidity and Capital Resources as of September 30, 2024 

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions, contractual obligations and other commitments. We assess liquidity in terms of our cash flows from operations and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities. 

As of September 30, 2024 (Successor), the Company has a working capital deficiency of approximately 7,404 thousand and cash of approximately 5,082 thousand. For the period ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), the Company incurred net loss of approximately 15,430 thousand and used approximately 4,629 thousand of cash for operating activities. 

The Management believes that the current liquidity position, including the cash raised under the promissory note of 3,000 thousand payable by December 2024, and the Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA ), pursuant to which the Lender desires to purchase up to 10,000 thousand in shares of the Company s Common Stock, par value 0.0001, has the ability to mitigate any going concern indicators for a period of at least one year from the date these financial statements are issued.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this filing. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

The Management believes there have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the items disclosed as critical accounting estimates in management s discussion and analysis in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that was filed with the SEC on May 24, 2024. 

JOBS Act Accounting Election 

Following the transaction, CXApp will be an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. As such, the Company will be eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that apply to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the requirements to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved. The Company has not made a decision whether to take advantage of any or all of these exemptions. If the Company does take advantage of some or all of these exemptions, some investors may find the Company s common stock less attractive. The result may be a less active trading market for the Company s common stock and its stock price may be more volatile. 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), for complying with new or revised accounting standards, meaning that CXApp, as an emerging growth company, can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision not to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. The material weakness and remediation activities were discussed in Part II, Item 9A Controls and Procedures of the Company s 2023 Annual Report filed on May 24, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The Company has made changes in its internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

We have initiated meaningful improvements to our internal controls during the third quarter of 2024. Notably, on August 19, 2024, we appointed Joy Mbanugo as our new Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Mbanugo brings a wealth of experience in financial management, compliance, and operational oversight, and she has quickly become instrumental in spearheading enhancements to our internal control framework. 

Her initial focus has been on addressing the material weaknesses identified in our financial reporting processes, with an emphasis on enhancing documentation, streamlining the review process, and ensuring alignment with SEC regulations and industry best practices. The implementation of these measures is expected to improve our control environment and mitigate the risks associated with our prior control deficiencies, ultimately driving more accurate and timely financial reporting in future periods.

Section 2.3. Notices . Written notice of each stockholders meeting stating the place, if any, date, and time of the meeting, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting and the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, shall be given in the manner permitted by Section 9.3 to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, by the Corporation not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting unless otherwise required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL ).

Section 2.4. Quorum .

If a quorum shall not be present or represented by proxy at any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.6 until a quorum shall attend. The stockholders present at a duly convened meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. The foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any such other corporation to vote shares held by it in a fiduciary capacity. 

Section 2.5. Voting of Shares . 

(a) Voting Lists . The Secretary of the Corporation (the Secretary shall prepare, or shall cause the officer or agent who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation to prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders of record entitled to vote at such meeting; provided, however, that if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address and the number and class of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing contained in this Section 2.5(a) shall require the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If a meeting of stockholders is to be held solely by means of remote communication as permitted by Section 9.5(a) , the list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of meeting.

2 

(b) Manner of Voting . At any stockholders meeting, every stockholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy. If authorized by the Board, the voting by stockholders or proxy holders at any meeting conducted by remote communication may be effected by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission (as defined in Section 9.3 ), provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which the Corporation can determine that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder. The Board, in its discretion, or the chairman of the meeting of stockholders, in such person s discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot. 

(c) Proxies . Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Proxies need not be filed with the Secretary until the meeting is called to order, but shall be filed with the Secretary before being voted. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, either of the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority. No stockholder shall have cumulative voting rights. 

(i) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or such stockholder s authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person s signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature. 

(ii) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. 

3 

(d) Required Vote . Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, at all meetings of stockholders at which a quorum is present, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. All other matters presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be determined by the vote of a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon, unless the matter is one upon which, by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these By Laws or applicable stock exchange rules, a different vote is required, in which case such provision shall govern and control the decision of such matter. 

(e) Inspectors of Election . The Board may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more persons as inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation or otherwise serve the Corporation in other capacities, to act at such meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Board may appoint one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspectors of election or alternates are appointed by the Board, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of outstanding shares and the voting power of each; determine the number of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots; count all votes and ballots and report the results; determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors; and certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election. Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by the inspector or by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors. 

Section 2.6. Adjournments . Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting, from time to time, whether or not there is a quorum, to reconvene at the same or some other place. Notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the date, time, and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the stockholders, or the holders of any class or series of stock entitled to vote separately as a class, as the case may be, may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 9.2 , and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.

The public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting shall not commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder s notice as described in this Section 2.7(a) .

Article VIII INDEMNIFICATION 

Section 8.1. Right to Indemnification . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an Indemnitee ), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 8.3 with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. 

Section 8.2. Right to Advancement of Expenses . In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 8.1 , an Indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law the expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees) incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an advancement of expenses ); provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon the Corporation s receipt of an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking ), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VIII or otherwise. 

Section 8.3. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit . If a claim under Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a final adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including a determination by its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, shall be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VIII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. 

18 

Section 8.4. Non-Exclusivity of Rights .

Section 8.5. Insurance . The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and/or any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. 

Section 8.6. Indemnification of Other Persons . This Article VIII shall not limit the right of the Corporation to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Indemnitees.

Section 8.8. Certain Definitions . For purposes of this Article VIII , (a) references to other enterprise shall include any employee benefit plan; (b) references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; (c) references to serving at the request of the Corporation shall include any service that imposes duties on, or involves services by, a person with respect to any employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and (d) a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation for purposes of Section 145 of the DGCL.

(b) Notice to Stockholders . Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws notice is required to be given to any stockholder, such notice may be given (i) in writing and sent either by hand delivery, through the United States mail, or by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service for next day delivery, or (ii) by means of a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder, to the extent permitted by, and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 232 of the DGCL. A notice to a stockholder shall be deemed given as follows: (i) if given by hand delivery, when actually received by the stockholder, (ii) if sent through the United States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with postage and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder s address appearing on the stock ledger of the Corporation, (iii) if sent for next day delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, when deposited with such service, with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder s address appearing on the stock ledger of the Corporation, and (iv) if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given and otherwise meeting the requirements set forth above, (A) if by facsimile transmission, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice, (B) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice, (C) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specified posting, upon the later of (1) such posting and (2) the giving of such separate notice, and (D) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.

Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (1) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (2) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or to the Corporation s transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. 

21

(e) Exceptions to Notice Requirements . Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person.

In the event that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful. 

Whenever notice is required to be given by the Corporation, under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, to any stockholder to whom (1) notice of two consecutive annual meetings of stockholders and all notices of stockholder meetings or of the taking of action by written consent of stockholders without a meeting to such stockholder during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings, or (2) all, and at least two payments (if sent by first-class mail) of dividends or interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been mailed addressed to such stockholder at such stockholder s address as shown on the records of the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice to such stockholder shall not be required. Any action or meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to such stockholder shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written notice setting forth such stockholder s then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such stockholder shall be reinstated. In the event that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to Section 230(b) of the DGCL. The exception in subsection (1) of the first sentence of this paragraph to the requirement that notice be given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the notice was given by electronic transmission. 

22
