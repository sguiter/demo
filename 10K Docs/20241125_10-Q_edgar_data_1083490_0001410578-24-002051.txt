 ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANICAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS FORM 10-Q In addition to historical information, this Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations, information currently available to us, estimates and projections about our industry, and certain assumptions made by our management. These statements are not historical facts. We use words such as anticipates , expects , intends , plans , believes , seeks , estimates , and similar expressions to identify our forward-looking statements, which include, among other things, our anticipated revenue and cost of our agency and investment business. Because we are unable to control or predict many of the factors that will determine our future performance and financial results, including future economic, competitive, and market conditions, our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They are subject to risks, uncertainties, and errors in assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements. We believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, the investor should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. They only reflect our view and expectations as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement in light of new information, future events, or other occurrences. There are several risks and uncertainties, including those relating to our ability to raise money and grow our business and potential difficulties in integrating new acquisitions with our current operations, especially as they pertain to foreign markets and market conditions. These risks and uncertainties can materially affect the results predicted. The Company s future operating results over both the short and long term will be subject to annual and quarterly fluctuations due to several factors, some of which are outside our control. These factors include but are not limited to fluctuating market demand for our services, and general economic conditions. The following Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A is intended to help the reader understand Sunrise Real Estate Group, Inc. SRRE ). MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes. OVERVIEW In October 2004, the former shareholders of Sunrise Real Estate Development Group, Inc. (Cayman Islands) CY-SRRE and LIN RAY YANG Enterprise Ltd. LRY acquired a majority of our voting interests in share exchange. Before the completion of the share exchange, SRRE had no continuing operations, and its historical results would not be meaningful if combined with the historical results of CY-SRRE, LRY and their subsidiaries. As a result of the acquisition, the former owners of CY-SRRE and LRY hold a majority interest in the combined entity. Generally accepted accounting principles require in certain circumstances that a company whose shareholders retain the majority voting interest in the combined business be treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the acquisition has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition arrangement whereby CY-SRRE and LRY are deemed to have purchased SRRE. However, SRRE remains the legal entity and the Registrant for Securities and Exchange Commission reporting purposes. The historical financial statements prior to October 5, 2004 are those of CY-SRRE and LRY and their subsidiaries. All equity information and per share data prior to the acquisition have been restated to reflect the stock issuance as a recapitalization of CY-SRRE and LRY. SRRE and its subsidiaries, namely, CY-SRRE, LRY, Shanghai Xin Ji Yang Real Estate Consultation Company Limited SHXJY ), Shanghai Shang Yang Real Estate Consultation Company, Ltd. SHSY ), Suzhou Gao Feng Hui Property Management Company, Ltd, SZGFH ), Suzhou Shang Yang Real Estate Consultation Company SZSY ), Suzhou Xin Ji Yang Real Estate Consultation Company, Ltd.

In October 2011, we established LYSY and own 34 of the company. During the first quarter of 2012, we acquired approximately 103,385 sqm for the purpose of developing villa-style residential housing. The LYSY project has divided into three phases. Phase 1 has completed construction of 121 units in May 2015 and sold 119 units out of all 121 units at the end of October 31, 2024. Phase 2 was divided into north and south area and completed construction of 84 units at the end of 2020. All 84 units have been sold during phase 2 by the end of October 31, 2024. Phase 3 began construction in first quarter of 2021and pre-sold 32 units out of 51units as of October 31,2024. In September 2020, the Company expanded the Linyi project by purchasing additional 54,312 sqm in the amount of 228 million RMB for future development. SHDEW was established in June 2013 with its business as a skincare and cosmetic company. SHDEW develops its own skincare products as well as improving its online ecommerce platform.

The products include skincare, cosmetics, personal care products such as soaps, shampoos, skin care devices and children s apparel. SHDEW has an online shopping app, , where consumers can purchase its cosmetics and skincare products as well as products imported into China. On October 31 st 2023, SHDEW held a shareholder meeting that agreed to SHDEW s dissolution by end of 2026.

In October 2018, HATX purchased the property in Huai an, Qingjiang Pu district with an area of 78,030 sqm. In December 2018, we established HAZB with a 78.46 ownership for the purpose of real estate investment and in March 2019, HAZB purchased 100 of HATX and its land usage rights to the Huai an property. The Huai an project, named Tianxi Times, started its first phase development in early 2019 with a GFA of 82,218 sqm totaling 679 units, and started its second phase in 2020 with a GFA of 99,123 sqm totaling 873 units. As of October 31, 2024, the Company sold and 660 units out of 679 units of the first phase and sold 503 units out of 873 of the second phase. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, which requires disclosure of gross write-offs of finance receivables by year of origination. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which would require additional transparency for income tax disclosures, including the income tax rate reconciliation table and cash taxes paid both in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on our disclosures. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss new accounting pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements. These financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP ), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, to disclose contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the consolidated financial statements, and to disclose the reported amounts of revenues and expenses incurred during the financial reporting period. The most significant estimates and assumptions include revenue recognition, and the useful lives and impairment of property and equipment, and investment properties, the valuation of real estate property under development, the recognition of government subsidies, and the provisions for income taxes. We continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We rely on these evaluations as the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We believe critical accounting policies as disclosed in this Form 10-Q reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions and estimates and were used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Most of the Company s revenue is derived from real estate sales in the PRC. The majority of the Company s contracts contain a single performance obligation involving significant real estate development activities that are performed together to deliver a real estate property to customers. Revenues arising from real estate sales are recognized when or as the control of the asset is transferred to the customer. The control of the asset may transfer over time or at a point in time. For the sales of individual condominium units in a real estate development project, the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue is recognized over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. Otherwise, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset. All revenues represent gross revenues less sales and business tax. ASC 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of the contract(s) which include (i) identifying the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identifying the separate performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (v) recognizing revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. ASC 606 also specifies the accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract and the costs directly related to fulfilling a contract. In addition, ASC 606 requires extensive disclosures. The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach with no restatement of comparative periods and no cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings recognized as of the date of adoption. A significant portion of the Company s revenue is derived from development and sales of condominium real estate property in the PRC, with revenue previously recognized using the percentage of completion method. Under the new standard, to recognize revenue over time similar to the percentage of completion method, contractual provisions need to provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment and the Company has no alternative use of the asset. Historically, all contracts executed contained an enforceable right to home purchase payments and the Company had no alternative use of assets, therefore, the adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Real Estate Property under Development Real estate property under development, which consists of residential unit sites and commercial and residential unit sites under development, is stated at the lower of carrying amounts or fair value less selling costs. 

 21 

Table of Contents 
 Expenditures for land development, including cost of land use rights, deed tax, pre-development costs and engineering costs, are capitalized and allocated to development projects by the specific identification method. Costs are allocated to specific units within a project based on the ratio of the sales value of units to the estimated total sales value times the total project costs. Costs of amenities transferred to buyers are allocated as common costs of the project that are allocated to specific units as a component of total construction costs. For amenities retained by the Company, costs in excess of the related fair value of the amenity are also treated as common costs. Results of operations of amenities retained by the Company are included in current operating results. In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ASC 360 ), real estate property under development is subject to valuation adjustments when the carrying amount exceeds fair value. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the assets is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. Deferred tax assets or liabilities were off-set by a 100 valuation allowance; therefore there has been no recognized benefit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We provide the following discussion and analyses of our changes in financial condition and results of operations for the period ended September 30, 2024 with comparisons to the period ended September 30, 2023.

For the third quarter of 2024, property management and house sales represented 5 and 95 of our net revenues, respectively. For the first three quarters of 2024, property management and house sales represented 8 and 92 of our net revenues, respectively. House sales revenue and cost of revenue is recognized when the house is handed over to the resident, thereby completing the transaction. The decrease in net revenue for the first nine months of 2024 was mainly due to less units were handed over for the Huaian Tianxi project in the first half of 2024. Property Management Property management represented 8 of our revenue for the first three quarters of 2024 and revenue from property management increased by 43 compared with the same period in 2023.

The increase in the cost of revenue in the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to the Company recognizing the cost of revenue of Huaian Tianxi project as there were an increase in home units being handed over to buyers.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES For the first three quarters of 2024, our principal sources of cash were revenues from our house sales collection and property management business, as well as the dividend receipt from the affiliates. Most of our cash resources were used to fund our property development investment and revenue related expenses, such as salaries and commissions paid to the sales force, daily administrative expenses and the maintenance of regional offices. We ended the period with a cash position of 25,645,002. The Company s operating activities used cash in the amount of 5,141,693, which was primarily attributable to real estate development. The Company s investing activities provided cash resources of 7,255,565, which was primarily attributable to the investment in transactional financial assets. The potential cash needs for 2024 are for investment in transactional financial assets, construction for our development projects in the Huai an project (HATX) and the Linyi project. According to the public records, the Market Supervision Administrations of Baokang County, which is a county located within Xiangyang City, Hubei Province, China, conducted an investigation into the business practices of SHDEW and some of its affiliates. SHDEW is in the business of selling cosmetics and other consumer goods online. While we own approximately 19.91 of SHDEW, we do not have any control or influence over its business practices. We are not related to this investigation, and we are unable to evaluate the merits of any allegations. The Baokang county fined SHDEW 20 million RMB and the case was closed. For the investigation for Heibei YuHua District, the case was dismissed and all frozen assets were unfrozen. SHDEW is currently not subject to any further investigation regarding these matters. Though the investment of SHDEW has been a main source of cashflow for the Company, we have no assurance that SHDEW will continue to pay dividends in the future. Capital Resources Considering our cash position, available credit facilities and cash generated from operating activities, we believe that we have sufficient funds to operate our existing business for the next twelve months. If our business otherwise grows more rapidly than we currently predict, we plan to raise funds through the issuance of additional shares of our equity securities in one or more public or private offerings. We will also consider raising funds through credit facilities obtained with lending institutions. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such funds through the issuance of debt or equity or obtain funds that are with terms satisfactory to management and our board of directors. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this item.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES A. Material Weaknesses As discussed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified one material weakness in the design and operation of our internal controls. The material weakness is related to the Company s accounting department personnel having limited knowledge and experience in U.S. GAAP. In response to the above identified material weakness and to continue strengthening the Company s internal control over financial reporting, we are going to undertake the following remediation initiatives: hiring additional personnel with sufficient knowledge and experience in U.S. GAAP; and providing ongoing training course in U.S. GAAP to existing personnel, including our Chief Financial Officer and Financial Controller. 
 Since the first quarter of 2015, additional qualified accounting personnel have been hired and put into place to assist preparation of financial information, as required for interim and annual reporting, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. As the newly implemented remediation activities have not operated for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate operating effectiveness, we will continue to monitor and assess our remediation activities to ensure that the aforementioned material weakness is remediated. B. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. The Company s management, with the participation of its principal executive and financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation and solely due to the unremediated material weakness described above, the Company s principal executive and financial officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective for the purpose for which they were designed as of the end of such period. As a result of this conclusion, the financial statements for the period covered by this report were prepared with particular attention to the unremediated material weakness previously disclosed. Accordingly, management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, notwithstanding the unremediated weaknesses. C. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Since the first quarter of 2015, we have put into place additional qualified accounting personnel to address the aforementioned material weakness. This action strengthened our internal controls over financial reporting. Except for the above, there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that was identified in connection with such evaluation that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
