CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes statements that express our opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or
projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. 
All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may be forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms believes, 
 estimates, continues, anticipates, expects, seeks, projects, 
 intends, plans, may, will, would or should or, in
each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. They appear in a number of places throughout this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things,
our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, future acquisitions and the industry in which
we operate. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following: 

the
 initiation, design, cost, timing, progress and results of, and our expected ability to undertake certain activities and accomplish
 our goals; 

the
 likelihood or timing of any regulatory approval; 

our
 ability to successfully commercialize, and our expectations regarding commercial potential with respect to, our products; 

the
 rate and degree of market acceptance of our products; 

the
 size and growth potential of the markets for our products, and our ability to serve those markets; 

our
 ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection; 

interactions
 with regulatory authorities in the United States and foreign countries; 

our
 ability to attract and retain experienced and seasoned scientific and management professionals to lead the Company; 

the
 performance of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers, including our ability to scale-up manufacturing levels as necessary; 

our
 ability to attract collaborators with relevant development, regulatory and commercialization expertise; 

future
 activities to be undertaken by our strategic alliance partners, collaborators and other third parties; 

our
 ability to develop sales and marketing capabilities, whether alone or with potential future collaborators; 

our
 ability to avoid, settle or be victorious at costly litigation with shareholders, former executives or others, should these situations
 arise; 

our
 ability to obtain and deploy funding for our operations and to efficiently use our financial and other resources; 

our
 ability to establish trading of our securities on the best listing or quotation service available to us; 

our
 ability to continue as a going concern; and 

the
 accuracy of our estimates regarding future expenses, future revenues, capital requirements and need for additional financing. 

By
their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that
may or may not occur in the future. We believe that these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in
the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

These
factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with the other cautionary statements in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. These and other factors should be considered carefully, including those contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under Risk
Factors for the year ended December 31, 2023, and readers should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. 

Although
we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are reasonable when made, we caution you that forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and
industry developments may differ materially from statements made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The matters summarized under Risk Factors , Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q could cause
our actual results to differ significantly from those contained in our forward-looking statements. In addition, even if our results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity, and industry developments are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. 

In
light of these risks and uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking
statement that we make in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speaks only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation
to update any forward-looking statement or to publicly announce the results of any revision to any of those statements to reflect future
events or developments, except as required by applicable law. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended
to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless specifically expressed as such, and should only be viewed as
historical data.

, under the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Company s principal executive
office is located in Grants, New Mexico. The Company holds the land, greenhouse, and patents required in the growth, production, and
research of medicinal plants. When used herein, the terms the Company, our, us, we, 
or Bright Green refers to Bright Green Corporation and its consolidated subsidiary, Regional Center Bright Green, LLC. 

On
May 17, 2022, the Company s common stock commenced trading on Nasdaq under the symbol BGXX. 

On
February 1, 2023, the Company initiated a private placement offering of common stock, only to accredited or qualified institutional
investors, in reliance upon Rule 506, Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, pursuant to the U.S. government s
EB-5 immigrant investor program (the EB-5 Program ). Under the EB-5 Program as originally constituted, the Company may
issue up to an aggregate of 
shares of common stock at 
per share. On March 29, 2024, the Company modified the program to authorize 
shares to be sold at 
per share. The offering allows for up to 50 investors to participate in the offering by making an 
investment in exchange for 
shares of common stock. 

On
May 21, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor and existing stockholder of the Company
for the sale by the Company of (i) shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share, and (ii) warrants
to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock, in a private placement offering. The combined
purchase price of one share and accompanying warrant was . The shares and the warrants were sold and issued without registration
under the Securities Act of 1933, in reliance on the exemptions provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as transactions not
involving a public offering and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act as sales to accredited investors, and in
reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws. 

On
September 20, 2023, the Company formed Regional Center Bright Green, LLC RCBG ). RCBG is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company and is registered as a limited liability company in New Mexico. RCBG was created to assist foreign investors in obtaining permanent
residency in the United States by investing in U.S. businesses, while adhering to the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program guidelines. The
subsidiary became operational on April 25, 2024. 

On
September 19, 2024, the Company was delisted from trading on Nasdaq and is currently trading on the OTC Markets under the symbol
 BGXX. 

The
Company is a start-up company as of September 30, 2024, and has revenue.

and ,
respectively. Net cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was and , respectively.
The Company has incurred recurring losses from operations, and as of September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of (December
31, 2023 and had a negative working capital of (December 31, 2023 ). 

The
Company is in its initial stages of building facilities to grow, research, and distribute medical plants. The Company has historically
financed its operations through the sale of equity securities and debt financing. The Company does not have sufficient working capital
to pay its operating expenses for a period of at least 12 months from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements were authorized
to be issued. Therefore, the Company s continued existence depends on its ability to continue executing its operating plan and
obtaining additional debt or equity financing. The Company has developed plans to raise funds and continues to pursue sources of funding
that management believes, if successful, would be sufficient to support the Company s operating plan. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised 
 from the Company s EB-5 Program. The Company
also has drawn, inclusive of accrued interest, 
 from the Company s 
 million related party line of credit and received
 
 from a related party short-term note payable
(Note 11). The funds from the related party short-term note payable were used to pay down the related party line of credit ,
leaving available 
 million to draw from that credit facility (Note 8). There is
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern due to the necessity to generate positive cash flows
from operations and/or obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate positive cash flows
from operations or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.

2. 
 Going Concern and Basis
 of Presentation (continued) 

In
addition, the Company s current and future operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited
to general economic conditions, competition, and regulatory matters. Accordingly, the Company s operation plan is predicated on
various assumptions including, but not limited to, the level of product demand, cost estimates, its ability to continue raising additional
financing, and the state of the general economic environment in which the Company operates. 

These
risks and uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and operating results. Management
has taken actions to address the Company s liquidity needs, including managing expenses, developing pathways to revenue, and pursuing
additional financing, such as the EB-5 Program announced on February 1, 2023, and modified on March 29, 2024. However, there can be no
assurance that such actions will be sufficient to enable the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that these
assumptions will prove accurate in all material respects or that the Company will be able to successfully execute its operating plan. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. In addition, the Company does not have any short or long-term contractual purchases with suppliers for future purchases, capital
expenditure commitments that cannot be canceled with minimal fees, noncancelable operating leases, or any commitment or contingency that
would hinder management s ability to scale down operations and management expenses until funding is raised. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the outcome of the matters described above. The condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

This
disclosure is intended to inform users of the condensed consolidated financial statements about the Company s current financial
condition and its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will continue to monitor its liquidity position and take appropriate
actions as necessary to address any potential going concern issues.

Stock
Options 

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value stock option grants to employees, non-employees, and directors. The fair
value of the Company s common stock is used to determine the fair value of stock options. The Black-Scholes option pricing model
requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected stock price volatility, (ii) the expected term of
the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate, and (iv) expected dividends. The historical volatility is calculated based on a period
of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. The Company uses the simplified method to calculate the expected term for options
granted to employees whereby the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of
the options due to its lack of sufficient historical data. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity
date commensurate with the expected term of the associated award. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as the Company has
never paid dividends and has no current plans to pay any dividends on its common stock. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.

and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for any period in the future. 

Overview 

Bright
Green Corporation (the Company, BGC, Bright Green, we, us, or our)
is a first-mover in the U.S. federally-authorized cannabis space. BGC is one of a few companies who have received from the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (the DEA ), a federal controlled substances registration for the bulk manufacturing of cannabis
under DEA Registration No. RB0649383 (the DEA Manufacturing Registration ), which allows the Company to produce and export
federally legal cannabis, cannabis extracts, and tetrahydrocannabinol in the U.S. We received the DEA Manufacturing Registration on April
28, 2023, pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement (the MOA with the DEA entered into on April 27, 2023, which replaced
the 2021 Memorandum of Agreement (the 2021 MOA (DEA Document Control Number W20078135E). In May 2023, we received a second
DEA registration for Importing Schedule I Controlled Substances under DEA registration No. RB0650754 (the DEA Importer Registration ). 

Unlike
state-licensed cannabis companies, which engage in commercial sales to consumers, and which businesses are legal under state law but
not federal law, subject to the milestones and requirements set forth herein, we are authorized by the federal government to sell
cannabis commercially for research and manufacturing purposes, export cannabis for international cannabis research purposes, and
sell cannabis to DEA-registered pharmaceutical companies for the production of medical cannabis products and preparations. Our
business activities under the DEA Manufacturing Registration are subject to applicable federal law and regulations and to our
obligations under the MOA we entered into with the DEA. Our DEA Manufacturing Registration and our DEA Importer Registration were
valid through July 31, 2024. On July 30, 2024, we received an extension letter from the DEA (the DEA Extension
Letter ), which allows us to operate while the DEA is processing our DEA Manufacturing Registration renewal application,
pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.36(i). The extension includes the ability to handle controlled substances throughout the time that the
renewal application is being processed. We received DEA Extension Letters for both the DEA Manufacturing Registration and for the
DEA Importer Registration. For our cannabis business line, we plan to focus on the development of cannabis strains and sales of
cannabis and hemp products with high contents of CBN (cannabinol) and CBG (cannabigerol). 

In
addition to research and pharmaceutical supply sales, Bright Green will be able to sell certain cannabinoids, such as CBN (cannabinol)
and CBG (cannabigerol) as hemp isolates or extracts and plans to sell CBN and CBG hemp products to consumers where such products are
fully legal under all applicable laws. On August 9, 2022, the DEA confirmed to BGC that cannabinoids, including, but not limited to CBN/CBG,
which meet the definition of hemp by having a Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on
a dry weight basis, are outside of the DEA s jurisdiction because they are not controlled under the CSA. Hemp and hemp products
were made legal by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the 2018 Farm Bill ), which has been codified in 21 U.S.C. 
802(16)(B)(i), and 7 U.S.C. 1639 o . This hemp product business line will be in addition to our research and pharmaceutical
cannabis activities conducted under the DEA Manufacturing Registration. 

28 

In
addition to hemp and cannabis, we plan to manufacture additional plant-based medicines derived from controlled substance plants and fungi,
including but not limited to, psilocybin, peyote cactus, and opium poppy as part of our Drugs Made in America strategy.
In February 2024, we received approval from the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy to produce additional Schedule I and Schedule II controlled
substances at our Grants, NM facility (NM Board of Pharmacy License Nos. CS02324187 (exp. July 31, 2027) and WD20220144 (Exp. December
31, 2025)). We have applied for an additional DEA bulk manufacturing registration for these additional Schedule I and Schedule II controlled
substances. Our decision to expand beyond cannabis to other plant-based medicines is in response to increased demand for additional controlled
substances, the growing need to bolster domestic supply and production of plant-based medicines, and the DEA s recent decision
to increase quotas for certain psychedelic controlled substances. Psilocybin, in particular, has received significant media attention
in recent years, and clinical trials on the drug s potential are underway at the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic Consciousness
Research, the University of California, New York University, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the Usona Institute, among
others. Additionally, in July 2023, the American Medical Association AMA published language for new Current Procedural
Terminology CPT III codes for psychedelic therapies. The codes went into effect on January 1, 2024. These new CPT codes
will facilitate reimbursement and access to FDA-approved psychedelic therapies in the U.S. While no psychedelic-assisted therapy has
yet been approved by the FDA, several potential new drugs are in various phases of clinical trials with the potential for at least one
approval in 2024. The additional DEA bulk manufacturing registration that Bright Green is seeking will allow us to supply the growing
demand for psychedelic and plant-based medicine research, as well as to produce Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients APIs for a number of key pharmaceutical drugs. Given the recent prescription drug shortages experienced both in the U.S. and in other countries,
our additional approval would allow us to meet U.S. demand for these drugs and contribute a consistent domestic supply of these drugs
both for API and for research purposes. 

Because
cannabis, and the other future controlled substances we have applied for DEA registration to manufacture, are still Schedule I and Schedule
II controlled substances in the U.S., they have been historically under-researched. Though the majority of Americans now live in states
where cannabis is legal, the full potential of the cannabis plant (and other controlled substance plants) for medicinal use remains understudied
due to limited access to federally-approved cannabis and other controlled substances. The DEA recently issued a call for more cannabis
research supply based on the increased demand for cannabis research in the U.S. As described herein, on April 28, 2023, we received the
DEA Manufacturing Registration, which allows us to produce federally legal cannabis, cannabis extracts, and tetrahydrocannabinol and
to sell legally within the U.S. to licensed researchers and pharmaceutical companies, in addition to qualifying us to export cannabis
internationally. In January 2024, the DEA increased its quotas not only for cannabis but also for psilocybin and other psychedelics to
meet medical and scientific needs. Our plan to expand our business to include additional controlled substances is in line with our Company s
mission and is in response to increased demand for these historically understudied plant medicines. 

BGC
must comply with the terms agreed upon pursuant to the MOA which include: submitting an Individual Procurement Quota on or before April
1 of each year utilizing DEA Form 250; submitting an Individual Manufacturing Quota on or before May 1 of each year utilizing DEA Form
189; collecting samples of cannabis and distributing them to DEA-registered analytical laboratories for chemical analysis during the
pendency of cultivation and prior to the DEA s taking possession of the cannabis grown; providing the DEA with 15-day advance written
notification, via email, of its intent to harvest cannabis; following the DEA s packaging, labeling, storage and transportation
requirements; distributing DEA s stocks of cannabis to buyers who entered into bona fide supply agreements with the Company; providing
the DEA with 15-day advance written notification of its intent to distribute cannabis; and invoicing the DEA for harvested cannabis that
it intends to sell to the DEA. 

Having
received our DEA Manufacturing Registration, we are permitted to cultivate and manufacture cannabis, supply cannabis researchers in the
U.S. and globally, and produce cannabis for use in pharmaceutical production of prescription medicines within the U.S. Our DEA Manufacturing
Registration permits our cannabis activities under federal law, which sets BGC apart from most other U.S. cannabis companies. 

We
have assembled an experienced team of medical professionals and researchers, international horticultural growers and experts, and construction
and cannabis production professionals, which we believe position us as a future industry leader in the production of plant-based medicines.

Key
Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations and Future Performance 

We
believe that our financial performance has been, and in the foreseeable future will continue to be, primarily driven by multiple factors
as described below, each of which presents growth opportunities for our business. These factors also pose important challenges that we
must successfully address in order to sustain our growth and improve our results of operations. Our ability to successfully address these
challenges is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section titled Risk Factors 
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 

Results
of Operations 

This
section includes a summary of our historical results of operations, followed by detailed comparisons of our results for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 

The
Company has not started commercial operations but has incurred expenses in connection with corporate and administrative matters, upkeep
of acquired properties for future growing, processing and distribution of medical plants, and improvements to those properties. These
expenses include stock-based compensation for services rendered, legal and audit fees, and property-related expenses such as depreciation,
insurance and taxes. As a result, the Company reported a net loss in both reporting periods. 

Three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenue: 

We
are a start-up company and have not generated any revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We do not
anticipate earning revenue until such time that we are able to sell cannabis commercially for research and manufacturing purposes, export
cannabis for international cannabis research purposes, and sell cannabis to DEA-registered pharmaceutical companies for the production
of medical cannabis products and preparations. We can provide no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenues from our intended
business operations to sustain a viable business operation. 

Operating
Expenses: 

We
incurred operating expenses in the amount of 1,111,924 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,811,533 for
the same period ended 2023. We incurred operating expenses in the amount of 4,513,678 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
as compared to 7,410,662 for the same period ended 2023. Our operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023 consisted entirely of general and administrative expenses and depreciation. The detail by major category within general and
administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are reflected in the table below.

Our
general and administrative expenses decreased by 684,260 and 2,852,940, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, largely due to decreased spending on officer salaries, stock-based compensation to executives,
and professional fees. 

We
expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in future quarters as we continue with our reporting obligations with the
SEC and the increased expenses associated with increased operational activity, which is expected for the balance of the year. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 40,366 compared to 10,059 as of December 31, 2023. The increase of 30,307 in cash was
primarily due to 880,000 received from the sales of common stock through the Company s EB-5 Program, a 414,352 net draw on the
related party line of credit, and 150,000 from a related party short-term note payable. This was partly offset by the
use of funds for the construction in progress, costs associated with the Company s SEC filings, and the utilization of funds from
the related party short-term note payable to pay down the related party line of credit. Since its inception, the Company has incurred
net losses and funded its operations primarily through the issuance of equities and draws on the line of credit provided by the Chairwoman
of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a total stockholders equity of 8,921,914 (December 31, 2023 - 10,964,945). 

The
Company is in its initial stages to start building facilities to grow, research, and distribute medical plants. The Company has incurred
recurring losses from operations and, as of September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of 50,700,777 (December 31, 2023 - 47,203,469)
and a negative working capital of 6,990,799 (December 31, 2023 5,968,030). 

The Company does not have sufficient working capital
to pay its operating expenses for a period of at least 12 months from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements were authorized
to be issued. The Company s continued existence is dependent upon its ability to continue to execute its operating plan and to
obtain additional debt or equity financing. 

The
Company has developed plans to raise funds and continues to pursue sources of funding that management believes, if successful, would
be sufficient to support the Company s operating plan.

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

The
Company does not have any short or long-term contractual purchases with suppliers for future purchases, capital expenditure commitments
that cannot be cancelled with minimal fees, noncancelable operating leases, or any commitment or contingency that would hinder management s
ability to scale down operations and management expenses until funding is raised. 

31 

Inflation 

Although
our operations are influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of
operations during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Off-balance
sheet arrangements 

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we
evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily available or apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. For a detailed discussion about the Company s significant accounting policies, refer to Note 3 Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements included in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no material changes were made to the Company s
significant accounting policies. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

A
description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations
is disclosed in Note 3 to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

JOBS
Act Accounting Election 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage
of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company
to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected
to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act until the earlier of the date we (1) are no longer an emerging growth company
or (2) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our condensed consolidated
financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company
effective dates.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

32 

Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of September 30, 2024 was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation as of September
30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of the period ended September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
recognizes that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of
any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
