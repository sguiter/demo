Under the 2024 Credit Agreement, the lenders have committed to provide to Nabors Delaware an aggregate principal amount of revolving loans at any time outstanding not in excess of million, and the issuing banks have committed to provide a standalone letter of credit tranche that permits Nabors Delaware to issue reimbursement obligations under letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not in excess of million. Letters of credit issued do not affect revolving loan capacity and vice versa. The 2024 Credit Agreement contains a million uncommitted accordion feature that can be applied to increase the commitments under either the revolving loans or the letter of credit tranche, or both. The Company is required to maintain an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/interest expense) of :1.00, and a minimum guarantor value, requiring the guarantors (other than the Company) and their subsidiaries to own at least of the consolidated property, plant and equipment of the Company.

 Senior Exchangeable Notes due June 2029 remains outstanding on the date that is 90 days prior to the applicable maturity date for such indebtedness, then such 90 th day.

The agreement also includes a collateral coverage requirement that the collateral rig fair value is to be no less than the collateral coverage threshold, as defined in the agreement. This requirement includes an independent appraisal report to be delivered every 6 months following the closing date. As of September 30, 2024, we had borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under our 2024 Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the 2024 Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024 was . In order to make any future borrowings under the 2024 Credit Agreement, Nabors and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to compliance with the conditions and covenants contained therein, including compliance with applicable financial ratios. As of the date of this report, we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2024 Credit Agreement. We expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under the 2024 Credit Agreement during the twelve-month period following the date of this report based on our current operational and financial projections. However, we can make no assurance of continued compliance if our current projections or material underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. If we fail to comply with the covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated, and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Senior Guaranteed Notes due August 2031 On July 22, 2024, Nabors issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior guaranteed notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Nabors and certain of Nabors indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.

As of September 30, 2024, million Warrants remain outstanding and million common shares have been issued as a result of exercises of Warrants. Each Warrant represents the right to purchase common share at an initial exercise price of per Warrant, subject to certain adjustments (the Exercise Price ). Payment of the exercise price may be in cash at this time. The Exercise Price and the number of common shares issuable upon exercise are subject to anti-dilution adjustments, including for share dividends, splits, subdivisions, spin-offs, consolidations, reclassifications, combinations, noncash distributions, cash dividends (other than regular quarterly cash dividends not exceeding a permitted threshold amount), certain pro rata shares repurchases, and similar transactions, including certain issuances of common shares (or securities exercisable or convertible into or exchangeable for common shares) at a price (or having a conversion price) that is less than of the market price of the common shares. The Warrants expire on June 11, 2026, but the expiration date may be accelerated at any time by the Company upon -days prior notice. The Warrants are traded on the over-the-counter market. The Warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Warrants were carried at fair market value using their trading price and totaled million and million, respectively. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements We applied fair value measurements to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis, which consist of measurements primarily related to equity method investments, other long-lived assets and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Based upon our review of the fair value hierarchy, the inputs used in these fair value measurements generally include Level 3 inputs but could include Level 1 and 2 inputs.

 million was recognized as an other than temporary impairment related to our investment in Vast Renewables Limited Vast ). As Vast is a publicly traded company, the valuation assessment was based on the observable market trading price of Vast s stock. During the third quarter, we determined that the fair value of our Vast investment was below carrying value for a prolonged period of time resulting in the impairment. This impairment has been included in Other, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Fair Value of Debt Instruments We estimate the fair value of our debt financial instruments in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The fair value of our long-term debt and revolving credit facilities is estimated based on quoted market prices or prices quoted from third-party financial institutions. The fair value of our debt instruments is determined using Level 2 measurements. senior exchangeable notes due January 2024 senior notes due February 2025 senior guaranteed notes due January 2026 senior priority guaranteed notes due May 2027 senior guaranteed notes due January 2028 senior exchangeable notes due June 2029 senior priority guaranteed notes due January 2030 senior guaranteed notes due August 2031 Less: current portion Less: deferred financing costs The fair values of our cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

 million (at September 30, 2024 exchange rates) against us relating to alleged violations of Algeria s foreign currency exchange controls, which require that goods and services provided locally be invoiced and paid in local currency. The case relates to certain foreign currency payments made to us by CEPSA, a Spanish operator, for wells drilled in 2006. Approximately million of the total contract amount was paid offshore in foreign currency, and approximately million was paid in local currency. The judgment includes fines and penalties of approximately four times the amount at issue. We have appealed the ruling based on our understanding that the law in question applies only to resident entities incorporated under Algerian law. An intermediate court of appeals upheld the lower court s ruling, and we appealed the matter to the Supreme Court. On September 25, 2014, the Supreme Court overturned the verdict against us, and the case was reheard by the Ouargla Court of Appeals on March 22, 2015 in light of the Supreme Court s opinion. On March 29, 2015, the Ouargla Court of Appeals reinstated the initial judgment against us. We appealed this decision again to the Supreme Court, which again overturned the appeals court s decision. The case was moved back to the court of appeals, which, once again, reinstated the verdict, failing to abide by the Supreme Court s ruling. Accordingly, we are appealing once more to the Supreme Court to try to get a final ruling on the matter. While our payments were consistent with our historical operations in the country, and, we believe, those of other multinational corporations there, as well as interpretations of the law by the Central Bank of Algeria, the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in a loss of up to million in excess of amounts accrued. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees) We are a party to some transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as off-balance sheet arrangements that could have a material future effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. The most significant of these off-balance sheet arrangements include the A/R Facility (see Note 4 Accounts Receivable Purchase and Sales Agreements) and certain agreements and obligations under which we provide financial or performance assurance to third parties. Certain of these financial or performance assurances serve as guarantees, including standby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers compensation insurance program and other financial surety instruments such as bonds. In addition, we have provided indemnifications, which serve as guarantees, to some third parties. These guarantees include indemnification provided by Nabors to our share transfer agent and our insurance carriers. We are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due under our indemnification guarantees.

We recognize a contract asset or liability when we transfer goods or services to a customer and bill an amount which differs from the revenue allocated to the related performance obligations. The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers and these timing differences result in receivables, contract assets, or contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. In general, we receive payments from customers based on dayrates as stipulated in our contracts (e.g., operating rate, standby rate, etc.). The invoices billed to the customer are based on the varying rates applicable to the operating status on each rig. Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Dayrate contracts also may contain fees charged to the customer for up-front rig modifications, mobilization and demobilization of equipment and personnel. These fees are associated with contract fulfillment activities, and the related revenue (subject to any constraint on estimates of variable consideration) is allocated to a single performance obligation and recognized ratably over the initial term of the contract. Mobilization fees are generally billable to the customer in the initial phase of a contract and generate contract liabilities until they are recognized as revenue. Demobilization fees are generally received at the end of the contract and generate contract assets when they are recognized as revenue prior to becoming receivables from the customer. We receive reimbursements from our customers for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at their request. Reimbursable revenues are variable and subject to uncertainty as the amounts received and timing thereof are dependent on factors outside of our influence. Accordingly, these revenues are constrained and not recognized until the uncertainty is resolved, which typically occurs when the related costs are incurred on behalf of the customer. We are generally considered a principal in these transactions and record the associated revenues at the gross amounts billed to the customer.

 our ability to successfully integrate Parker s business with our own and to realize the expected benefits of the merger with Parker; and the combined company s ability to utilize NOLs. Our business depends, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Therefore, a sustained increase or decrease in the price of oil or natural gas, that has a material impact on exploration, development and production activities, could also materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The above description of risks and uncertainties is by no means all-inclusive but highlights certain factors that we believe are important for your consideration. For a more detailed description of risk factors that may affect us or our industry, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. Management Overview This section is intended to help you understand our results of operations and our financial condition. This information is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. We are a leading provider of advanced technology for the energy industry. With operations in over 15 countries, Nabors has established a global network of people, technology and equipment to deploy solutions that deliver safe, efficient and sustainable energy production. By leveraging its core competencies, particularly in drilling, engineering, automation, data science and manufacturing, Nabors aims to innovate the future of energy and enable the transition to a lower carbon world. Outlook The demand for our services and products is a function of the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. The level of exploration, development and production activities is to a large extent tied to the prices of oil and natural gas, which can fluctuate significantly, are highly volatile and tend to be highly sensitive to factors including supply and demand cycles and geopolitical uncertainties particularly those impacting large hydrocarbon-producing countries. Certain oil and gas companies may also intentionally limit their capital spending as they focus on generating returns to shareholders as opposed to maximizing hydrocarbon production. Additionally, there has recently been an increasing number of customer consolidations within the industry especially in the United States. In some cases, these transactions may have an impact on overall rig demand, as the acquiring company may apply criteria that results in a different level of demand for drilling rigs than the previous two companies would have had on a stand-alone basis. Since late 2022 and continuing through the third quarter of 2024, global energy commodity markets have experienced high levels of volatility. In the U.S., operators generally reacted to these market conditions by reducing their drilling activity. Recent production actions announced by certain large international oil producers have been supportive of both oil prices and oil-focused activity broadly, especially in international markets. Natural gas prices, particularly in the United States, declined significantly through 2023 and into 2024, to levels which largely persisted through the third quarter of 2024 and which have caused operators to reduce natural gas directed activity. In early 2023 economic sentiment was overshadowed by a pervasive concern that a global recession would take hold. The U.S. Federal Reserve s tightening of interest rates reduced capital availability in the U.S energy market. As these higher interest rates continued, rig counts in the U.S. Lower 48 continued to decline throughout the year. More recently, the U.S. Federal Reserve reduced interest rates. The impact of that decision should become evident in the coming quarters. Despite the reduction in rig count, rig pricing discipline remained intact, generally supportive of rig dayrates and daily rig margins. U.S. oil and gas production has proved resilient thus far in 2024 in the face of reduced drilling activity. Internationally, we generally see an expansion of production capacity as well as the widespread development of unconventional resources driving an expected increase in oilfield activity broadly across those markets.

 Recent Developments 2024 Credit Agreement On June 17, 2024, Nabors Delaware amended and restated its credit agreement (the 2024 Credit Agreement ). Under the 2024 Credit Agreement, the lenders have committed to provide to Nabors Delaware up to 350.0 million in revolving loans, and the issuing banks have committed to provide a standalone letter of credit tranche that permits Nabors Delaware to issue reimbursement obligations under letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount not in excess of 125.0 million. Letters of credit issued will not affect revolving loan capacity and vice versa. The 2024 Credit Agreement contains a 200.0 million uncommitted accordion feature that can be applied to increase the commitments under either the revolving loans or the letter of credit tranche, or both. The facility matures on the earlier of (a) June 17, 2029 and (b) to the extent 10 or more of the respective principal amount of any of the 7.375 Senior Priority Guaranteed Notes due May 2027 or 7.50 Senior Guaranteed Notes due January 2028 or 50 or more of the principal amount of the 1.75 Senior Exchangeable Notes due June 2029 remains outstanding on the date that is 90 days prior to the applicable maturity date for such indebtedness, then such 90 th day. 8.875 Senior Guaranteed Notes due August 2031 On July 22, 2024, Nabors issued 550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.875 senior guaranteed notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Nabors and certain of Nabors indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The notes have a maturity date of August 15, 2031. Nabors used the net proceeds, along with cash on hand, to redeem all of its 7.25 senior guaranteed notes due January 2026. Acquisition of Parker Drilling Company On October 14, 2024, we and certain subsidiaries of ours entered into a merger agreement (the Merger Agreement to acquire Parker Drilling Company Parker ), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, we will acquire Parker for 4.8 million of our common shares, subject to a collar. The precise number of shares to be issued to Parker stockholders will be determined based upon the volume weighted average price of Nabors common shares on the NYSE for the 15 trading days ending the fifth day before the closing of the merger Closing Price and, if that Closing Price is below 42.70, Parker stockholders will also receive a cash component for their shares of Parker stock. If the volume weighted average price is above 99.62, the merger consideration will consist of the number of shares equal to 478,176,000 divided by the Closing Price. Parker provides drilling services across global energy markets. Through its Quail Tools subsidiary, Parker is the leading rental provider of high-performance downhole tubulars in the U.S. market. Internationally, Parker provides tubular rentals and repair services, with state-of-the-art facilities located in key geographies. Parker offers differentiated, casing and tubular running services in the U.S., the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. Its portfolio also includes a fleet of 17 drilling rigs in the U.S. and international markets, as well as Operations Maintenance services primarily in Canada and Alaska. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and receipt of required regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Operating revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 731.8 million, representing a decrease of 2.2 million, or 0 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For a more detailed description of operating results, see Segment Results of Operations below. Net loss attributable to Nabors totaled 55.8 million 6.86 per diluted share) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss attributable to Nabors of 48.9 million 6.26 per diluted share) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, or a 6.9 million increase in net loss. The increase in net loss is primarily related to higher interest expense of 11.3 million and higher other, net of 6.1 million offset by an improvement in adjusted

 operating income of 16.1 million for our segments from the prior year. See below for further discussion on each of these income statement items. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 64.0 million, representing an increase of 1.8 million, or 3 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This is reflective of increases in workforce costs, general operating costs and inflationary pressures as market conditions have improved. Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 159.2 million, representing a decrease of 2.1 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is a result of lower capital expenditures over recent years coupled with a higher amount of older assets reaching the end of their useful lives. Segment Results of Operations The following tables set forth certain information with respect to our reportable segments and rig activity: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease) (In thousands, except percentages and rig activity) U.S. Drilling Operating revenues 254,773 276,385 (21,612) (8) Adjusted operating income (loss) (1) 41,694 49,582 (7,888) (16) Average rigs working (2) 74.0 80.4 (6.4) (8) International Drilling Operating revenues 368,594 344,780 23,814 7 Adjusted operating income (loss) (1) 32,182 9,862 22,320 226 Average rigs working (2) 84.7 77.2 7.5 10 Drilling Solutions Operating revenues 79,544 72,831 6,713 9 Adjusted operating income (loss) (1) 29,231 25,341 3,890 15 Rig Technologies Operating revenues 45,809 61,437 (15,628) (25) Adjusted operating income (loss) (1) 2,761 4,995 (2,234) (45) 

 (1) Adjusted operating income (loss) is our measure of segment profit and loss. See Note 11 Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of the report. (2) Represents a measure of the average number of rigs operating during a given period. For example, one rig operating 45 days during a quarter represents approximately 0.5 average rigs working for the quarter. On an annual period, one rig operating 182.5 days represents approximately 0.5 average rigs working for the year. U.S. Drilling Operating revenues for our U.S. Drilling segment decreased by 21.6 million or 8 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to a decrease in activity as reflected by an 8 decrease in the average number of rigs working, while pricing remained stable. International Drilling Operating revenues for our International Drilling segment during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 23.8 million or 7 compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase is primarily attributable to a 10 increase in the average rigs working, reflecting increased drilling activity as market conditions and demand for our international drilling services have increased since the prior year.

Table of Contents 
 Drilling Solutions Operating revenues for this segment increased by 6.7 million or 9 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period as an increase in demand for our international and third-party services offset a decline in results in the U.S. markets, which was driven by the reduction in drilling activity. Rig Technologies Operating revenues for our Rig Technologies segment decreased by 15.6 million or 25 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period due to the overall decline in activity in the U.S. as mentioned previously. Adjusted operating income was relatively flat despite the 25 drop in operating revenues, due to a change in mix of business focusing more on the higher margin product lines. Other Financial Information Interest expense Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 55.4 million, representing an increase of 11.3 million, or 26 , compared to three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our effective interest rate levels on our outstanding debt throughout the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other, net Other, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of 41.6 million compared to 35.5 million loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 representing a 6.1 million decrease in income. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the amount consisted of 3.4 million in foreign currency transaction losses, 6.0 million in loss on sales of assets, 15.4 million in other than temporary impairment on securities and 12.3 million of loss recognized for debt buybacks which was offset by 2.9 million of mark-to-market gains on the common share warrants. In comparison, the amount during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of 13.7 million from increases in litigation reserves, 7.6 million from mark-to-market losses on the common share warrants, 7.1 million in losses on sales and disposals of long-lived assets and 4.9 million in foreign currency transaction losses. Income tax Our worldwide tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.1 million compared to 10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in tax expense was primarily attributable to the change in amount and geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings (losses). The Organization Economic Co-operation and Development OECD introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS Pillar 2 rules that impose a global minimum tax rate of 15 . Several legal entities in the Nabors group have enacted Pillar 2 legislation effective January 1, 2024. The enactment of this legislation results in application of the global minimum tax to certain of our legal entities and their subsidiaries. The enactment of Pillar 2 did not have a material impact to our worldwide tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2.2 billion, representing a decrease of 79.9 million, or 4 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For a more detailed description of operating results, see Segment Results of Operations below. Net loss attributable to Nabors totaled 122.4 million 15.69 per diluted share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net income attributable to Nabors of 4.9 million 2.79 loss per diluted share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, or a 127.3 million decrease in net income. The decrease in net income attributable to Nabors is partially due to a decline in U.S. activity which has resulted in a decrease of approximately 16.7 million in adjusted operating income for our segments from the prior year. In addition, interest expense increased

 by 21.9 million and other, net deteriorated by 78.4 million. See below for further discussion on each of these income statement items. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 187.9 million, representing an increase of 0.8 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This is reflective of increases in workforce costs, general operating costs and inflationary pressures as market conditions have improved. Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 477.1 million, representing a decrease of 7.0 million, or 1 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is a result of the limited capital expenditures over recent years coupled with a higher amount of older assets reaching the end of their useful lives. Segment Results of Operations The following tables set forth certain information with respect to our reportable segments and rig activity:

 On September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings and 51.7 million of letters of credit outstanding under the 2024 Credit Agreement, which has a total borrowing capacity of 350.0 million and a separate letter of credit tranche that permits us to issue letters of credit with total reimbursement obligations not to exceed 125 million. Letters of credit issued do not affect revolving loan capacity and vice versa. The 2024 Credit Agreement requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/interest expense of 2.75:1.00) and a minimum guarantor value, requiring the guarantors (other than the Company) and their subsidiaries to own at least 90 of the consolidated property, plant and equipment of the Company. Additionally, the Company is subject to certain covenants (which are subject to certain exceptions) and include, among others, (a) a covenant restricting our ability to incur liens (subject to the additional liens basket of up to 150.0 million, among other exceptions), (b) a covenant restricting its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to its capital stock and to repurchase certain indebtedness, and (c) a covenant restricting the ability of the Company s subsidiaries to incur debt (subject to the grower debt basket of up to 100.0 million). The facility matures on the earlier of (a) June 17, 2029 and (b) to the extent 10 or more of the respective principal amount of any of the 7.375 Senior Priority Guaranteed Notes due May 2027 or 7.50 Senior Guaranteed Notes due January 2028 or 50 or more of the principal amount of the 1.75 Senior Exchangeable Notes due June 2029 remains outstanding on the date that is 90 days prior to the applicable maturity date for such indebtedness, then such 90 th day. As of the date of this report, we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2024 Credit Agreement, including those regarding the required interest coverage ratio and minimum guarantor value, which were 4.65:1.00 and 99.77 , respectively, as of September 30, 2024. If we fail to perform our obligations under the covenants, the revolving credit commitments under the 2024 Credit Agreement could be terminated, and any outstanding borrowings under the facilities could be declared immediately due and payable. If necessary, we have the ability to manage our covenant compliance by taking certain actions including reductions in discretionary capital or other types of controllable expenditures, monetization of assets, amending or renegotiating the revolving credit agreement, accessing capital markets through a variety of alternative methods, or any combination of these alternatives. We expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under the 2024 Credit Agreement during the twelve-month period following the date of this report based on our current operational and financial projections, including after giving effect to the Merger. However, we can make no assurance of continued compliance if our current projections or material underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. If we fail to comply with the covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated, and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing may be affected by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by the major credit rating agencies in the United States and our historical ability to access these markets as needed. While there can be no assurances that we will be able to access these markets in the future, we believe that we will be able to access capital markets or otherwise obtain financing in order to satisfy any payment obligation that might arise upon maturity, exchange or purchase of our notes and our debt facilities, loss of availability of our revolving credit facilities and our A/R Agreements (see Accounts Receivable Purchase and Sales Agreements, below), and that any cash payment due, in addition to our other cash obligations, would not ultimately have a material adverse impact on our liquidity or financial position. The major U.S. credit rating agencies have previously downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to non-investment grade. These and any further ratings downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations. We had 9 letter-of-credit facilities with various banks as of September 30, 2024. Availability under these facilities as of September 30, 2024 was as follows: 

September 30, 2024 (In thousands) Credit available 353,667 Less: Letters of credit outstanding, inclusive of financial and performance guarantees 125,670 Remaining availability 227,997 Accounts Receivable Purchase and Sales Agreements On September 13, 2019, we entered into an accounts receivables sales agreement (the A/R Sales Agreement and an accounts receivables purchase agreement (the A/R Purchase Agreement and, together with the A/R Sales Agreement, the A/R Agreements ), whereby the originators, all of whom are our subsidiaries, sold or contributed, and

Table of Contents 
 will on an ongoing basis continue to sell or contribute, certain of their domestic trade accounts receivables to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity SPE ). The SPE in turn, sells, transfers, conveys and assigns to third-party financial institutions Purchasers ), all the rights, title and interest in and to its pool of eligible receivables. Over the term of the facility, we entered into a number of amendments. Most recently, on April 1, 2024, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the A/R Purchase Agreement, which among other things, extended the term of the A/R Purchase Agreement to the earliest of (i) April 1, 2027 and (ii) the date that is ninety (90) calendar days prior to the occurrence of the maturity date under and as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement. The amount available for purchase under the A/R Agreements fluctuates over time based on the total amount of eligible receivables generated during the normal course of business after excluding excess concentrations and certain other ineligible receivables. The maximum purchase commitment of the Purchasers under the A/R Agreements is 250.0 million and the amount of receivables purchased by the third-party Purchasers as of September 30, 2024 was 146.0 million. The originators, Nabors Delaware, the SPE, and the Company provide representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities under the A/R Agreements and the Indemnification Guarantee. See further details at Note 4 Accounts Receivable Purchase and Sales Agreements. Other Indebtedness See Note 5 Debt, for further details about our financing arrangements, including our debt securities. Future Cash Requirements Our current cash and investments, projected cash flows from operations, proceeds from equity or debt issuances, the A/R Agreements and the facilities under our 2024 Credit Agreement are expected to adequately finance our purchase commitments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, scheduled debt service requirements, and all other expected cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we can make no assurances that our current operational and financial projections will prove to be correct. A sustained period of highly depressed oil and natural gas prices could have a significant effect on our customers capital expenditure spending and therefore our operations, cash flows and liquidity. Purchase commitments outstanding at September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 269.3 million, primarily for capital expenditures, other operating expenses and purchases of inventory. We can reduce planned expenditures if necessary or increase them if market conditions and new business opportunities warrant it. The level of our outstanding purchase commitments and our expected level of capital expenditures over the next 12 months represent a number of capital programs that are currently underway or planned. See our discussion of guarantees issued by Nabors that could have a potential impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future periods included below under Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees). There have been no material changes to the contractual cash obligations that were included in our 2023 Annual Report. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, both in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and may involve material amounts. Cash Flows Our cash flows depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Sustained decreases in the price of oil or natural gas could have a material impact on these activities and could also materially affect our cash flows. Certain sources and uses of cash, such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures or acquisitions, purchases and sales of investments, dividends, loans, issuances and 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 repurchases of debt and of our common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions. We discuss our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 below. Operating Activities . Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 432.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided of 455.9 million during the corresponding 2023 period. Operating cash flows are our primary source of capital and liquidity. Cash from operating results (before working capital changes) was 512.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 17.3 million when compared to 530.1 million in the corresponding 2023 period. This was due to the decrease in activity across our business for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Changes in working capital items such as collection of receivables, other deferred revenue arrangements and payments of operating payables are also significant factors affecting operating cash flows and can be highly volatile in periods of increasing or decreasing activity levels. Changes in working capital items used 80.4 million in cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 6.2 million unfavorable change as compared to the 74.2 million in cash flows used by working capital in the corresponding 2023 period. Investing Activities . Net cash used for investing activities totaled 353.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used of 429.0 million during the corresponding 2023 period. Our primary use of cash for investing activities is capital expenditures for rig-related enhancements, new construction and equipment, and sustaining capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we used cash for capital expenditures totaling 359.9 million and 406.7 million, respectively. Financing Activities . Net cash used by financing activities totaled 662.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid 1.2 billion of outstanding long-term debt and received proceeds of 550.0 million from the issuance of the 8.875 Senior Guaranteed Notes due August 2031. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled 54.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received proceeds of 250.0 million from issuance of the 1.75 Exchangeable Notes, repaid 296.5 million of outstanding long-term debt. We received proceeds of 305.0 million from the public offering of NETC II and made a distribution of 186.9 million from the Trust Account to NETC stockholders who exercised their right to redemption of their shares. Other Matters Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees) We are a party to transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as off-balance sheet arrangements that could have a material future effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. The most significant of these off-balance sheet arrangements include the A/R Agreements (see Accounts Receivable Purchase and Sales Agreements, above) and certain agreements and obligations under which we provide financial or performance assurance to third parties. Certain of these financial or performance assurances serve as guarantees, including standby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers compensation insurance program and other financial surety instruments such as bonds. In addition, we have provided indemnifications, which serve as guarantees, to some third parties. These guarantees include indemnification provided by us to our share transfer agent and our insurance carriers. We are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due under our indemnification guarantees. Management believes the likelihood that we would be required to perform or otherwise incur any material losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote.

 The following table summarizes the total maximum amount of financial guarantees issued by Nabors: 

Maximum Amount 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Financial standby letters of credit and other financial surety instruments 27,791 18,295 3,763 12,547 62,396 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We may be exposed to market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business as discussed in our 2023 Annual Report. There were no material changes in our exposure to market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS See Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies Litigation for information regarding our legal proceedings. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this report, the risk factors set forth in Part 1, Item 1A, of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered when evaluating us. These risks are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business. There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Part 1, Item 1A, of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K other than those listed in this section. Risk Factors Relating to the Merger Risk Factors Relating to Changes in the Price of Nabors Common Shares The market value of Nabors common shares could be negatively affected by risks and conditions that apply to the combined company, which may be different from the risks and conditions applicable to Nabors, and sales of Nabors shares in connection with merger would impact the price of our common shares. Following the merger, shareholders of Nabors and former stockholders of Parker will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded business with more assets and a different mix of liabilities. Current shareholders of Nabors and current stockholders of Parker may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company or may wish to reduce their investment in the combined company. In addition, if, following the merger, large amounts of Nabors common shares are sold, the price of Nabors common shares could decline.

 Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the future business and financial results of Nabors. The merger is subject to a number of conditions beyond Nabors and Parker s control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, regulatory approval from the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice as required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and certain foreign antitrust and foreign direct investment regulatory approvals. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to satisfy all of the conditions to the merger or succeed in any litigation brought in connection with the merger. If the merger is not completed, our financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including but not limited to: Nabors being required to pay Parker a termination fee of 10,000,000 under certain circumstances provided in the merger agreement payment of costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees, regardless of whether the merger is completed the focus of Nabors management team on the merger instead of the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to Nabors and the potential occurrence of litigation related to any failure to complete the merger. 
 In addition, if the merger is not completed, Nabors may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees. If the merger is not completed, Nabors cannot assure its stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially and adversely affect the business, financial results and stock price of Nabors. Completion of the merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Parker is a party. The completion of the merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Parker is a party. If Nabors and Parker are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if Nabors and Parker are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Parker or the combined company. The failure to negotiate a waiver, or to obtain amendments to these agreements on favorable terms, could have an adverse effect on the combined company. Litigation relating to the merger could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the applicable transaction and/or substantial costs to us. Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition, merger, or other business combination agreements. Even if such a lawsuit is without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Lawsuits that may be brought against us or our directors could also seek, among other things, injunctive relief or other equitable relief, including a request to rescind parts of the Merger Agreement already implemented and to otherwise enjoin the parties from consummating the applicable transaction. If a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the applicable transaction, that injunction may delay or prevent such transaction from being completed within the expected timeframe or at all, which may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any of the defendants will be successful in the outcome of any potential future lawsuits. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is completed may adversely affect the combined company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Risk Factors Relating to the Combined Company Following the Merger The failure to integrate successfully the businesses of Nabors and Parker or to effectively managed the consolidated company post-merger could adversely affect the combined company s future results. The merger involves the integration of two companies that currently operate independently. The success of the merger will depend in large part on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits, including expected synergies, cost savings, increased innovation and operational efficiencies, from combining the businesses of Nabors and Parker. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses of Nabors and Parker must be successfully integrated. This integration will be complex and time-consuming. The failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company not achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following: preserving our and Parker s relationships with our existing customers and vendors; complexities associated with managing the larger, more complex combined business complexities associated with integrating the workforces of the two companies, including issues retaining key management personnel at both companies potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger difficulty or inability to refinance the debt of the combined company or comply with the covenants thereof performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies operations and the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, systems, procedures and policies. 
 Any of these difficulties in successfully integrating the businesses of Nabors and Parker, or any delays in the integration process, could adversely affect the combined company s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger and could adversely affect the combined company s business, financial results, financial condition and stock price. Even if the combined company is able to integrate the business operations of Nabors and Parker successfully, there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, increased innovation and operational efficiencies that Nabors and Parker currently expect from this integration, that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame or that these benefits will match our current expectations. Following integration, the combined company s future success will depend on its ability to manage its operations, which will be significantly larger than the size of either our or Parker s existing businesses. The failure to successfully integrate the two companies, to realize the expected benefits of the merger, or to manage the consolidated company s operations, could have an adverse effect on the consolidated company. The combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Nabors and Parker following the merger. The combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of Nabors and Parker following the merger. There are many processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including accounting and finance, asset management, benefits, billing, drilling data solutions, health, safety and environment, human resources, maintenance, marketing, payroll and purchasing. Although Nabors and Parker have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred, there are many factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 savings that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. These integration expenses could result in the combined company s taking charges against earnings following the completion of the merger, and the amount and timing of any such charges are uncertain at present. The combined company may not be able to utilize a portion of Nabors or Parker s net operating loss carry forwards NOLs to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal tax purposes, which could adversely affect the combined company s net income and cash flows. As of June 30, 2024, Parker had federal income tax NOLs of approximately 347.8 million, of which 243.5 million will expire between 2035 and 2037, and 104.3 million have an indefinite life. As of September 30, 2024, Nabors had federal income tax NOLs of approximately 559.3 million, all of which have an indefinite life. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including the combined company s future taxable income, which cannot be predicted with any accuracy. In addition, Section 382 of the Code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of an NOL that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an ownership change (as determined under Section 382). Determining the limitations under Section 382 is technical and highly complex. An ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders (or groups of shareholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5 of the corporation s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. For these reasons, the combined company may not be able to realize a material portion of Parker s NOLs, which could result in the combined company facing increased future tax liability. The due diligence process that we undertook before entering into the Merger Agreement with Parker may not have revealed all facts that may be relevant in connection with merger. In deciding whether to enter into the Merger Agreement, we conducted the due diligence investigation that we deemed reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to the merger with Parker. When conducting due diligence, we were required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, technological, governance, legal and regulatory issues. In addition to our employees, outside consultants, legal advisors and accountants were involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees. Despite our efforts, the results of our due diligence may have not been complete and accurate or, even if complete and accurate, may have not been sufficient to identify all relevant facts, which could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the merger with Parker and the business and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS We withheld the following shares of our common shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with grants of share awards during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the distributions described below. These shares may be deemed to be issuer purchases of shares that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this Item, but were not purchased as part of a publicly announced program to purchase common shares: 

Approximated Total Number Dollar Value of of Shares Shares that May Total Average Purchased as Yet Be Number of Price Part of Publicly Purchased Period Shares Paid per Announced Under the (In thousands, except per share amounts) Repurchased Share (1) Program Program (2) July 1 - July 31 1 82.08 278,914 August 1 - August 31 278,914 September 1 - September 30 278,914 

 (1) Shares were withheld from employees and directors to satisfy certain tax withholding obligations due in connection with grants of shares under our 2016 Stock Plan. Each of the 2016 Stock Plan and the 1999 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors provide for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax obligations, but do not specify a maximum number of shares that can be withheld for this purpose. These shares were not purchased as part of a publicly announced program to purchase common shares.

 (2) In August 2015, our Board authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to 400.0 million of our common shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The program was renewed by the Board in February 2019. Through September 30, 2024, we repurchased 0.3 million of our common shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 121.1 million under this program. As of September 30, 2024, we had 278.9 million that remained authorized under the program that may be used to repurchase shares. The repurchased shares, which are held by our subsidiaries, are registered and tradable subject to applicable securities law limitations and have the same voting, dividend and other rights as other outstanding shares. As of September 30, 2024, our subsidiaries held 1.2 million of our common shares. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 5.
