million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. An allowance for credit losses is established based on TEC s collection experience and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. Circumstances that could affect TEC s estimates of credit losses include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, generating fuel prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions. Accounts are reserved in the allowance or written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unbilled revenues of million and million, respectively, are included in the Receivables line item on the Condensed Balance Sheets. 
 million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and totaled million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

million, effective January 1, 2025, and additional adjustments of million and million for 2026 and 2027, respectively. Tampa Electric s proposed rates include recovery of solar generation projects, energy storage capacity, a more resilient and modernized energy control center, and other resiliency and reliability projects. Prior to the rate case hearing, Tampa Electric submitted revisions to its requested base rate increase to reflect items that included production tax credits, energy storage life expectancy, and the company s grid reliability and resilience project. The company s August 22, 2024, requested revenue requirement reflects a base rate increase of million, effective January 1, 2025, and adjustments of million and million for 2026 and 2027, respectively. From August 26 through 30, 2024, Tampa Electric s rate case hearing was heard by the FPSC. A decision by the FPSC is expected by the end of 2024. Tampa Electric Mid-Course Adjustment to Fuel Recovery On April 2, 2024, Tampa Electric requested a mid-course adjustment to its fuel and capacity charges, reflecting a million reduction over 12 months, from June 2024 through May 2025. The requested reduction is due to a significant decrease in actual and projected 2024 natural gas prices since Tampa Electric submitted its projected 2024 costs in the fall of 2023. On May 7, 2024, the FPSC approved the mid-course adjustment. Tampa Electric Storm Restoration Cost Recovery In accordance with Tampa Electric s 2021 rate case settlement agreement, in the event of a named storm that results in damage to its system, Tampa Electric can petition the FPSC to seek recovery of those costs over a period or longer as determined by the FPSC, as well as replenish its storm reserve regulatory liability. Based on an FPSC order, if the charges to the storm reserve exceed the reserve liability account balance, the excess is to be carried as a regulatory asset. At June 30, 2024, the balance in the reserve liability for storm restoration costs was million. At September 30, 2024, the balance in the regulatory asset for storm restoration costs was million. Hurricane Helene made landfall on September 26, 2024. Tampa Electric was impacted by Hurricane Helene, resulting in a peak number of customers out of approximately . Tampa Electric expects approximately million to million to be charged to the storm reserve regulatory asset and a minimal impact to earnings. The majority of the costs that are expected to be charged to the storm regulatory accounts were recorded in September 2024. Hurricane Milton, the worst weather event to impact the area in over , made landfall on October 9, 2024. Tampa Electric was impacted by Hurricane Milton, resulting in a peak number of customers out of approximately . Tampa Electric expects approximately million to million to be charged to the storm reserve regulatory asset and a minimal impact to earnings. Restoration costs for the storms described above will be deferred and are expected to be collected from customers in subsequent periods. Tampa Electric will determine the timing of the request for recovery of Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton costs at a future time.

Long-term regulatory liabilities 

(1) The regulatory tax asset is primarily associated with the depreciation and recovery of AFUDC-equity. This asset does not earn a return but rather is included in the capital structure, which is used in the calculation of the weighted cost of capital used to determine revenue requirements. It will be recovered over the expected life of the related assets. 

 (2) These assets and liabilities are related to FPSC clauses and riders, primarily related to the fuel clause and the decrease in natural gas prices. They are recovered or refunded through cost-recovery mechanisms approved by the FPSC on a dollar-for-dollar basis in a subsequent period. 

 (3) This asset is related to the remaining net book value of Big Bend Units 1 through 3 and meter assets that were retired. The balance earns a rate of return as permitted by the FPSC and will be recovered as a separate line item on customer bills for a period of , beginning in 2022 through 2036. 

 (4) This asset is related to the deferred costs of postretirement benefits and it is amortized over the remaining service life of plan participants. Deferred costs of postretirement benefits that are included in expense are recognized as cost of service for rate-making purposes as permitted by the FPSC. 

 (5) See "Tampa Electric Storm Restoration Cost Recovery" above for information regarding this reserve. The regulatory asset is included in rate base and earns a rate of return as permitted by the FPSC. 

 (6) The regulatory tax liability is primarily related to the revaluation of TEC s deferred income tax balances recorded on December 31, 2017 at the lower corporate income tax rate due to U.S. tax reform. The liability related to the revaluation of the deferred income tax balances is amortized and returned to customers through rate reductions or other revenue offsets based on IRS regulations and the settlement agreement for tax reform benefits approved by the FPSC. 

 (7) This item represents the non-ARO cost of removal in the accumulated reserve for depreciation. AROs are costs for legally required removal of property, plant and equipment. Non-ARO cost of removal represents estimated funds received from customers through depreciation rates to cover future non-legally required cost of removal of property, plant and equipment, net of salvage value upon retirement, which reduces rate base for ratemaking purposes. This liability is reduced as costs of removal are incurred.

million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Income Tax Expense TEC is included in a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with EUSHI and its subsidiaries. TEC s income tax expense is based upon a standalone return method, modified for the benefits-for-loss allocation in accordance with EUSHI's tax sharing agreement. To the extent that TEC s cash tax positions are settled differently than the amount reported as realized under the tax sharing agreement, the difference is accounted for as either a capital contribution or a distribution. TEC s effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were and , respectively. The September 30, 2024 and 2023 effective tax rates are an estimate of the annual effective income tax rate. TEC s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from the statutory rate principally due to production tax credits and amortization of the regulatory tax liability resulting from tax reform. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is lower compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to production tax credits. See Note 3 for further information regarding the regulatory tax liability. Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million and million, respectively, all of which was recorded as a reduction of deferred income tax assets for tax credit carryforwards. The unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce TEC s effective tax rate.

Prior to February 1, 2029, in the case of the 2029 Notes, TEC may redeem all or any part of such series of Notes at its option at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate plus basis points less interest accrued to the date of redemption or (ii) of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. On or after February 1, 2029, TEC may redeem the 2029 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. TEC used the net proceeds from this offering for the repayment of a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. Therefore, million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility were reclassified from notes payable to long-term debt on the Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023. TEC 3.875 Notes due 2024 On July 12, 2024, TEC repaid a million note upon maturity. This note was repaid with proceeds from commercial paper.

Remaining Performance Obligations Remaining performance obligations primarily represent lighting contracts with fixed contract terms. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately million and million, respectively. As allowed under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, these amounts exclude contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and variable amounts for which TEC recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. TEC expects to recognize revenue for the remaining performance obligations through .

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Operating Company Results 
 Amounts included below are pre-tax, except net income and income taxes. 
 Tampa Electric s net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 185 million, compared with 170 million for the same period in 2023. Results primarily reflected higher base revenues resulting from customer growth and the 2021 rate case settlement agreement combined with additional storm protection plan return on investment and additional AFUDC earnings, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable weather and higher depreciation expense. Base revenues are energy sales excluding revenues from clauses, gross receipts taxes and franchise fees. Clauses, gross receipts taxes and franchise fees do not have a material effect on net income as these revenues substantially represent a dollar-for-dollar recovery of clause and other pass-through costs. 
 Revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were 71 million lower than in the same period in 2023, driven by decreased fuel clause and storm surcharge revenue and less favorable weather, partially offset by customer growth and new base rates as a result of the 2021 rate case settlement agreement. Total degree days (a measure of heating and cooling demand) in Tampa Electric's service area in the third quarter of 2024 were 6 above normal (a 20-year statistical degree day average) and 6 below the 2023 period, reflecting unfavorable weather in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023. Net energy for load, which is a calendar measurement of energy output, decreased by 1 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 O M expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 34 million lower than in 2023 due to decreased storm cost recognition of 34 million related to storm surcharge revenue (offset in revenue). Depreciation and amortization expense increased 8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of additions to facilities and the in-service of generation projects. 
 Tampa Electric s net income year-to-date 2024 was 384 million, compared with 381 million for the same period in 2023. Results primarily reflected higher base revenues resulting from customer growth and the 2021 rate case settlement agreement combined with additional storm protection plan return on investment and additional AFUDC earnings, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable weather, higher depreciation expense and higher operations and maintenance expense. 
 Revenues were 80 million lower than year-to-date 2023 primarily driven by decreased fuel clause and storm surcharge revenue and less favorable weather, partially offset by customer growth and new base rates as a result of the 2021 rate case settlement agreement. Total degree days (a measure of heating and cooling demand) in Tampa Electric's service area year-to-date 2024 were 4 above normal (a 20-year statistical degree day average) and 5 below the 2023 period, reflecting less favorable weather year-to-date in 2024 compared to 2023. Results also reflect a 2 increase in the number of customers year-to-date in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Net energy for load, which is a calendar measurement of energy output, for year-to date 2024 was consistent with the same period in 2023. 
 O M expense was 33 million lower than year-to-date 2023 due to decreased storm cost recognition of 55 million related to storm surcharge revenue (offset in revenue) partially offset by increased operational expenses of 10 million and regulatory deferrals of 12 million. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher generation costs related to outages, transmission and distribution expense, and bad debt expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 24 million year-to-date 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to additions to facilities and the in-service of generation projects. 
 Tampa Electric s regulated operating statistics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

Other Income 
 For the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, TEC s other income was 13 million and 24 million, which included AFUDC-equity of 9 million and 6 million, interest income from affiliate of 0 and 10 million, and other income of 4 million and 8 million. For the year-to-date periods in 2024 and 2023, respectively, TEC s other income was 33 million and 68 million, which included AFUDC-equity of 20 million and 13 million, interest income from affiliate of 0 and 28 million, and other income of 13 million and 27 million. The increase in AFUDC-equity is primarily due to the timing of resiliency and other projects. The decrease in interest income from affiliate is primarily due to the repayment of the receivable from PGS on December 20, 2023. The decrease in other income is primarily due to lower interest income on the deferred fuel balance. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 For the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, TEC s interest expense, including interest expense to affiliates and excluding AFUDC-debt, was 52 million and 63 million, respectively. For the year-to-date periods in 2024 and 2023, TEC s interest expense, including interest expense to affiliates and excluding AFUDC-debt, was 152 million and 184 million, respectively. The decrease was due to lower borrowings resulting from proceeds received from affiliate loan repayments related to the separation of PGS from TEC in 2023 and lower fuel under-recoveries. See Other Income above for information regarding the 2023 interest income from affiliate associated with PGS's allocation of short-term and long-term debt resulting from the separation of PGS from TEC as of January 1, 2023. The 2023 interest income from affiliate partially offsets the impact of TEC's 2023 interest expense within Net Income on the Statement of Income. 
 Income Taxes 
 The provisions for income taxes were 27 million and 32 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 53 million and 71 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Compared to the 2023 periods, the decrease in the provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher benefit from production tax credits related to solar facilities.

Cash Impacts Related to Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 853 million, a decrease of 58 million compared to the same period in 2023. Decreases to cash from operations were primarily due to the timing of fuel cost collection and changes in accounts receivable balances resulting from decreased fuel and storm cost recoveries reflected in customer bills. 
 Cash Impacts Related to Financing Activities 
 Cash flows from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in net cash inflows of 143 million. TEC received 555 million of equity contributions from Parent and 495 million of net proceeds from a long-term debt issuance, partially offset by 321 million of net payments in short-term debt with maturities with 90 days or less, 300 million of repayment of long-term debt and 284 million of dividends to Parent. 
 Covenants in Financing Agreements 
 In order to utilize its bank credit facilities, TEC must meet certain financial tests as defined in the applicable agreements. In addition, TEC has certain restrictive covenants in specific agreements and debt instruments. At September 30, 2024, TEC was in 
 19 

compliance with all applicable financial covenants. The following table contains the significant financial covenant and the performance relative to it at September 30, 2024.

 Commitments and Contingencies 
 See Note 8 to the TEC Condensed Financial Statements for information regarding TEC s commitments and contingencies as of September 30, 2024. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 See Note 3 to the TEC Condensed Financial Statements for information regarding TEC s regulatory matters, including TEC's request for a base rate increase and TEC's storm restoration cost recovery. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 TEC considered the impact of nonperformance risk in determining the fair value of derivatives. TEC considered the net position with each counterparty, past performance and the intent of the parties, indications of credit deterioration and whether the markets in which TEC transacts have experienced dislocation. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of derivatives was not materially affected by nonperformance risk. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates have not materially changed in 2024. For further discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates, see TEC s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Environmental Compliance 
 On April 24, 2024, the EPA issued its final power plant rules for certain electric generating units, including (i) new GHG standards; (ii) Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS); (iii) Effluent Limit Guidelines (ELGs) and (iv) new Coal Combustion Residual (CCR) rules. The new MATS and ELGs will not have a material impact on TEC. The new GHG standard applies only to existing coal-fired and new natural gas electric generating units and will therefore have limited impact on Tampa Electric generating units. Big Bend Unit 4 is the only unit affected. As written, the rule would require Big Bend Unit 4 to retire in 2039 without major enhancements to the unit, instead of the current planned retirement date of 2040. 
 The new CCR rule covers any landfill or impoundment in existence at an inactive power facility but not receiving CCRs as of 2015, any CCR placed into the environment for beneficial uses, or CCR units (landfills and impoundments) previously closed under state programs. TEC is currently evaluating the impact of the new CCR rule at the Big Bend Power Station and will likely require site evaluations beginning in 2025 to determine the presence or absence of CCR management units. If found, additional evaluations would be required in 2026 and based on those findings, modifications to the site groundwater monitoring could be required beginning in 2027 to determine the need for additional corrective action. 
 TEC expects that the costs to comply with new environmental regulations would be eligible for recovery. If approved as prudent, the costs would be reflected in customers bills, recovered through either the ECRC or base rates.

 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . TEC s management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of TEC s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, TEC s principal financial officer and principal executive officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, TEC s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

(b) Changes in Internal Controls . There was no change in TEC s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of TEC s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during TEC s last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such controls.
