In this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to common shares refer to the common shares in our capital stock. As used in this quarterly report, the terms we , us , our and our company mean Lithium Corporation and our now defunct wholly-owned subsidiary Lithium Royalty Corp., a Nevada company, unless otherwise indicated. General Overview We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 30, 2007 under the name Utalk Communications Inc. . At inception, we were a development stage corporation engaged in the business of developing and marketing a call-back service using a call-back platform. Because we were not successful in implementing our business plan, we considered various alternatives to ensure the viability and solvency of our company. On August 31, 2009, we entered into a letter of intent with Nevada Lithium Corporation regarding a business combination which could be effected in one of several different ways, including an asset acquisition, merger of our company and Nevada Lithium, or a share exchange whereby we would purchase the shares of Nevada Lithium from its shareholders in exchange for restricted shares of our common stock. Effective September 30, 2009, we effected a 1 old for 60 new forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of 0.001 to 3,000,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of 0.001 and our then issued and outstanding shares increased from 4,470,000 shares of common stock to 268,200,000 shares of common stock. Also effective September 30, 2009, we changed our name from Utalk Communications, Inc. to Lithium Corporation , by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary Lithium Corporation, which was formed solely for the change of name. The name change and forward stock split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening for trading on October 1, 2009 under the stock symbol LTUM . Our CUSIP number is 536804107. 15 Table of Contents On October 9, 2009, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Nevada Lithium and the shareholders of Nevada Lithium. The closing of the transactions contemplated in the share exchange agreement and the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock in the capital of Nevada Lithium occurred on October 19, 2009. In accordance with the closing of the share exchange agreement, we issued 12,350,000 shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of Nevada Lithium in exchange for the acquisition, by our company, of all of the 12,350,000 issued and outstanding shares of Nevada Lithium. Also, pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, a director of our company cancelled 220,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock. Nevada Lithium s corporate status was allowed to lapse and the company s status with the Nevada Secretary of State has been revoked. Our Current Business We are an exploration stage mining company engaged in the identification, acquisition, and exploration of metals and minerals with a primary focus on lithium mineralization on properties located in Nevada, and Graphite and Rare Earth Element properties in British Columbia. Our current operational focus is to judiciously conduct exploration activities on all our mineral properties and generate additional prospects for our exploration portfolio. In March of 2022 we staked a block of claims in North Big Smoky Valley covering approximately 3400 acres which roughly corresponds to the lands previously held by Lithium Corporation s former subsidiary Lithium Royalty Corp. in 2016/2017. On May 13, 2022 we signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Morella Corporation (a related party) whereby Morella can earn a 60 interest in the property by paying 65,000 US (done) to the Company on the signing of the LOI, and issuing 100,000 worth of Morella shares at the time of signing the formal agreement, and issuing 100,000 worth of shares at each anniversary of the signing of the formal agreement over the next four years. Additionally Morella must incur exploration expenditures of 100,000, 200,000, 300,000 and 400,000 in years one through four of the option agreement. Should they fulfill these obligations they will have earned an undivided 60 interest in the property and may purchase a further 20 interest within 1 year for 750,000, and purchase the remaining 20 interest within the following year for 750,000. Should Morella buy Lithium Corporation s undivided working interest in the property, the Company will revert to a 2.5 Net Smelter Royalty interest, of which would be purchasable by Morella for 1,000,000. Since Optioning the property Morella has conducted Controlled Source Audio-Magnetotelluric geophysical and sediment geochemical surveys, staked more claims adjacent to the original option claim block as well as staking a non-contiguous area to the north and west of the earlier claims here. Most recently Morella has concluded a two-hole drilling program, testing for both lithium-in-brine and clay mineralization, where anomalous lithium-in-clay mineralization was discovered, but no lithium-in-brine mineralization was encountered. On September 16 th 2021 Lithium Corporation signed an agreement with Surge Battery Metals whereby Surge could have earned an 80 interest in the Company s San Emidio lithium-in-brine prospect in Washoe County Nevada, by paying an initial 50,000 and issuing 200,000 shares of Surge (TSX-V:Nili). Surge had undertaken to make payments of 620,000 in cash and stock over 5 years while incurring expenditures on the property of 1,000,000 over that period. Upon fulfillment of the aforementioned commitments Surge would have been deemed to have earned their undivided 80 interest and could have formed a joint venture with the Company. The Company had optioned this property off before as effective May 3, 2016, our company entered in to an Exploration Earn-In Agreement with 1067323 B.C. Ltd. with respect to our San Emidio property. The terms of the formal agreement were; payment of 100,000, issuance of 300,000 common shares of 1067323 B.C. Ltd., or of the publicly traded company anticipated to result from a Going Public Transaction, and work performed on the property by the Optionee in the amount of 600,000 over the following three years to earn an 80 interest in the property. 1067323 then had a subsequent Earn-In option to purchase Lithium Corporation s remaining 20 working interest within three years of earning the 80 by paying our company a further 1,000,000, at which point our company would retain a 2.5 Net Smelter Royalty, half of which could have been purchased by 1067323 for an additional 1,000,000. 1067323 B.C. Ltd. merged with American Lithium Corp., and the first tranche of cash and shares were issued in June of 2016. The Company waived the work requirement for the first year and received extra shares of American Lithium Corp as consideration for the amendment to the Agreement. In June 2018, the Company received notification that the purchaser was relinquishing any right to earn an interest in the property and, as such, 202,901 was taken into income. During the year-ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a 217,668 allowance for the property which then had a net book value of Nil. Surge Battery Metals completed some geochemical work on the prospect block and gave Lithium Corporation formal notice in Summer 2022 that they were relinquishing all interest in the property. In Fall 2022 the Company completed a Controlled Source Audio- Magnetotelluric (CSAMT) survey on the property, and is currently considering next steps with respect to exploring and developing this property. 16 Table of Contents On April 29, 2021 we signed a Letter Of Intent (LOI) with Altura Mining Limited (now Morella Corporation after a name change) an Australian Lithium explorer and developer, and related party whereby Morella can earn a 60 interest in the Fish Lake Valley lithium-in-brine property in Esmeralda County, Nevada by paying the Company 675,000, issuing the equivalent of 500,000 worth of Morella stock, and expending 2,000,000 of exploration work over the next four years. To date Morella is current with its obligations under the formal agreement ratified on October 12th 2021, having paid the initial 50,000 on signing the LOI, the 100,000 due on signing the formal agreement, and has issued 28,176,951 shares of Morella (1MC:ASX, Altaf:OTC-QB) common stock. In the last couple of years Morella has completed two phases passive seismic and magnetotelluric (MT) surveys, and are most recently have received permits for drilling on both the south and northern blocks. Preparatory work for drilling was done during the summer of 2022, and drilling commenced in early October, on this initial two-hole exploratory program to the northeast of the playa, away from the area of known mineralization, where moderate lithium mineralization was encountered in clays and weak lithium mineralization encountered in brines. The Company had originally acquired this property through a June 2009 Option Agreement, and conducted geochemical, geological, geophysical and drilling work on it over the next several years eventually optioning the property off to the successors of American Lithium Corp in 2016, who conducted geophysical, and geochemical surveys and did some drilling work over the the next few years. On March 2, 2017 we issued a news release announcing that we had signed a letter of intent with Bormal Resources Inc. with respect to three Tantalum-Niobium properties (Michael, Yeehaw, and Three Valley Gap) located in British Columbia, Canada. Bormal conducted a stream sediment sampling program on the Michael property in 2014, and determined that the tantalum-niobium in stream sediment anomaly here is bona fide, and in the order of 6 kilometers in length. In November of 2016 Lithium Corporation conducted a short soil geochemistry orientation program on the property as part of its due diligence, and determined that there are elevated levels of Niobium-Tantalum in soils here. Also in the general area of the Michael property the Yeehaw property had been staked over a similar but lower amplitude Tantalum/rare earth elements in stream sediment anomaly. Both properties are situated in the Eocene Coryell Batholith, and it is thought that these anomalies may arise from either Carbonatite or Pegmatite type deposits. The Company conducted a helicopter borne bio-geochemical survey on these two properties in June 2017, which did return anomalous results. This was followed up by a geological and geochemical examination of the Yeehaw property in early July 2017, and additional work of a similar nature subsequently in July 2017, and in early October 2017. The examination uncovered a zone roughly 30 meters wide which includes an interval that is mineralized with approximately 0.75 Total Rare Earth Elements (TREE s). On February 23, 2018 we issued a news release announcing that we had dropped any interest in the Michael and Three Valley Gap properties, and had renegotiated the final share payment as required in the agreement from 750,000 to 400,000 shares. The final consideration shares were issued and the Yeehaw property was transferred by Bormal. During 2017 the Company conducted initial stream, rock and magnetometer surveys on the property, and discovered a 30 meter wide structure (Horseshoe Bend showing) that exhibits anomalous Titanium/REE mineralization. The company has staked an additional 5227 acre (2115.51 hectares) mineral claim and conducted a brief exploration program in Spring 2018 of geological mapping and rock and soil sampling on the property. This program discovered a slightly stronger zone of similar mineralization approximately 660 feet (200 meters) to the northwest of the Horseshoe Bend, and similar float mineralization another 0.75 miles (1.2 kms) further to the northwest. Work in 2019 discovered the extension to the west of the mineralized structure, and also similar mineralized float was found to the east that possibly indicates it strikes under cover in that direction also. Field work was done on this property over the past few field seasons, and the Company is currently determining what work will be done during the 2024 field season. 17 Table of Contents Effective April 23, 2014, we entered into an operating agreement with All American Resources, L.L.C and TY Sons Investments Inc. with respect to Summa, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company incorporated on December 12, 2013, wherein we hold a 25 membership. Summa was formed to acquire and administer the residual lands that originated in the 60 s and 70 s through Howard Hughes s Hughes Corporation, which went on a mining property buying spree at that time. Our company's capital contribution to Summa, LLC was 125,000, of which 100,000 was in cash and the balance in services. To date we have contributed an additional 31,700 in cash, and also over the years an indeterminate amount of casual geological and land expertise to Summa, LLC. In recognition, Summa transferred five urban lots in Tonopah of indeterminate value in 2020, and since Jan 2021 have issued checks to the company for 157,500. The Tonopah property was optioned in early 2020, and the Optionee has earned a 100 interest in the property. Summa still retains a 1 (LTUM s share 0.25 Net Smelter Royalty on the property. Recently Summa entered into an agreement with North American Silver Corporation (TSX-V:NSC) whereby NSC can earn a 100 interest with respect to Summa s Belmont Nevada claims (not to be confused with the Belmont mine in Tonopah) by paying 200,000 in cash or at Optionor s discretion shares over 5 years, and election must be made by the sixth agreement anniversary to purchase the lands (69.96 acres) at 10,000 per acre. Should NSC earn their interest Summa, LLC would retain a 1 Net Smelter Royalty 50 of which may be subsequently purchased by the Optionor. Summa, LLC still retains a 100 interest (subject to a 2 NSR in favor of Summa Corp. (the successor entity to the Hughes Corporation) in a further five project areas in the state of Nevada, and Lithium Corporation remains committed to casually helping them move the projects along so that they may be optioned eventually. In April 2024 we announced we had recently staked a 5,178 acre (2095 hectare) property prospect for Fluorine mineralization in the Greenwood Mining Division in southern British Columbia. The property was subsequently expanded through the staking of two other blocks of claims bringing our total holdings in the area to approximately 11,068 acres (4479 hectares) that in part envelopes the claim block hosting the past producing Rock Candy Fluorspar mine. The Company commenced geochemical and geological exploratory work on the property in Spring 2024, and work there is currently ongoing. Also the Company is compiling all data available relative to this property from all open sources. Our company intends to continue identifying additional lithium properties in Nevada and to conduct exploration on our British Columbia properties. We will continue assessing our options with respect to our 25 interest in Summa, LLC, a private Nevada company, which holds the residue of Howard Hughes s Summa Corporation, while generating new prospects and evaluating property submittals for option or purchase. Fish Lake Valley Property Fish Lake Valley is a lithium enriched playa (also known as a salar, or salt pan), which is located in northern Esmeralda County in west central Nevada, and the property is roughly centered at 417050E 4195350N (NAD 27 CONUS). We currently hold eighteen, 80-acre Association Placer claims that cover approximately 1,440 acres (582.75 hectares). Lithium-enriched Tertiary-era Fish Lake formation rhyolitic tuffs or ash flow tuffs have accumulated in a valley or basinal environment. Over time interstitial formational waters in contact with these tuffs, have become enriched in lithium, boron and potassium which could possibly be amenable to extraction by evaporative methods. Our claim block here has expanded and contracted twice, at times when the lithium market has contracted, and the prudent thing to do would be to only maintain essential claims, in order to preserve capital. The property was originally held under mining lease purchase agreement dated June 1, 2009, between Nevada Lithium Corporation, and Nevada Alaska Mining Co. Inc., Robert Craig, Barbara Craig, and Elizabeth Dickman. Nevada Lithium issued to the vendors 350,000 worth of common stock of our company in eight regular disbursements. All disbursements were made of stock worth a total of 350,000, and claim ownership was transferred to our company. The geological setting at Fish Lake Valley is highly analogous to the salars of Chile, Bolivia, and Peru, and more importantly Clayton Valley, where Albemarle has its Silver Peak lithium-brine operation. Access is excellent in Fish Lake Valley with all-weather gravel roads leading to the property from state highways 264, and 265, and maintained gravel roads ring the playa. Power is available approximately 10 miles from the property, and the village of Dyer is approximately 12 miles to the south, while the town of Tonopah, Nevada is approximately 50 miles to the east. 18 Table of Contents Our company completed a number of geochemical and geophysical studies on the property, and conducted a short drill program on the periphery of the playa in the fall of 2010. Near-surface brine sampling during the spring of 2011 outlined a boron/lithium/potassium anomaly on the northern portions of the northern playa, that is roughly 1.3 x 2 miles long, which has a smaller higher grade core where lithium mineralization ranges from 100 to 150 mg/L (average 122.5 mg/L), with boron ranging from 1,500 to 2,670 mg/L (average 2,219 mg/L), and potassium from 5,400 to 8,400 mg/L (average 7,030 mg/L). Wet conditions on the playa precluded drilling there in 2011, and for a good portion of 2012, however a window of opportunity presented itself in late fall 2012. In November/December 2012 we conducted a short direct push drill program on the northern end of the playa, wherein a total of 1,240.58 feet (378.09 meters) was drilled in 20 holes at 17 discrete sites, and an area of 3,356 feet (1,023 meters) by 2,776 feet (846 meters) was systematically explored by grid probing. The deepest hole was 81 feet (24.69 meters), and the shallowest hole that produced brine was 34 feet (10.36 meters). The average depth of the holes drilled during the program was 62 feet (18.90 meters). The program successfully demonstrated that lithium-boron-potassium-enriched brines exist to at least 62 feet (18.9 meters) depth in sandy or silty aquifers that vary from approximately three to ten feet (one to three meters) in thickness. Average lithium, boron and potassium contents of all samples are 47.05 mg/L, 992.7 mg/L, and 0.535 respectively, with lithium values ranging from 7.6 mg/L to 151.3 mg/L, boron ranging from 146 to 2,160.7 mg/L, and potassium ranging from 0.1 to 1.3 . The anomaly outlined by the program is 1,476 by 2,461 feet (450 meters by 750 meters), and is not fully delimited, as the area available for probing was restricted due to soft ground conditions to the east and to the south. A 50 mg/L lithium cutoff is used to define this anomaly and within this zone average lithium, boron and potassium contents are 90.97 mg/L, 1,532.92 mg/L, and 0.88 respectively. On September 3, 2013, we announced that drilling had commenced at Fish Lake Valley. Due to storms and wet conditions in the area which our company hoped to concentrate on, the playa was not passable, and so the program concentrated on larger step-out drilling well off the playa. This 11 hole, 1,025 foot program did prove that mineralization does not extend much, if at all, past the margins of the playa, as none of the fluids encountered in this program were particularly briny, and returned values of less than 5 mg/L lithium. Our company is very pleased with the results here, and believes that the playa at Fish Lake Valley may be conducive to the formation of a Silver Peak style lithium brine deposit. Our company reviewed the results in regards to the overall geological interpretation of the lithium, boron and potassium bearing strata. The results confirm the presence of targeted mineralization and further evaluation programs will focus on determining the extent and depth of mineralization. Our company is currently assessing options on how best to further explore here. We signed an Exploration Earn-In Agreement in February 2016 with 1032701 B.C. Ltd., a private British Columbia company with respect to our Fish Lake Valley lithium brine property. 1032701 B.C. Ltd., had the option to acquire an initial 80 undivided interest in the Fish Lake Valley property through the payment of an aggregate of US 300,000 in cash, completing a Going Public Transaction on or before May 6, 2016, and subject to the completion of the Going Public Transaction, arranging for the issuance of a total of 400,000 common shares in the capital of the Resulting Issuer. The Optionee had to make qualified exploration or development expenditures on the property of 200,000 before the first anniversary, an additional 300,000 before the second anniversary, an additional 600,000 prior to the third anniversary, and make all payments and perform all other acts to maintain the Property in good standing before fully earning their 80 interest. Additionally, terms were to be negotiated for the Optionee to purchase our 20 interest in the property for 1,000,000, at which point our interest would revert to a 2 1/2 Net Smelter Royalty (NSR). The Optionee may then elect at any time to purchase one half of our NSR for 1,000,000. On April 7, 2016, 1032701 B.C. Ltd. was acquired by Menika Mining Ltd., which subsequently changed its name to American Lithium Corp.(TSXV: LI) In connection with the acquisition of 1032701 and in accordance with the Exploration Earn-In Agreement, 200,000 common shares were issued to our company. In addition, we received payment of 130,000. In March of 2017 American Lithium Corp. issued 100,000 common shares and paid the company 100,000 to satisfy their option commitment. In March of 2018 American Lithium issued 10,000 common shares (as they had recently rolled their stock back on a 1 for 10 basis), and paid the company 100,000. In addition it was agreed that Lithium Corporation would extend the deadline for the year two exploration expenditure until September 30 th 2018 for consideration of a further 80,000 shares. American Lithium Corporation conducted confirmation shallow brine sampling on the property, and drilled two exploratory wells off the playa area in 2016. In Summer 2018 they reportedly completed a short seismic survey adjacent to the Company s claims here, and attempted to drill a hole on the Company s claims but were unsuccessful due to wet ground conditions. On April 30 th 2019 American Lithium issued formal relinquishment of Purchasers right to earn the interest under the agreement. On April 29, 2021 we signed a Letter Of Intent (LOI) with Altura Mining Limited (now Morella Corporation) an Australian Lithium explorer and developer, and related party. Under the formal agreement which was signed in October 2021 Morella can earn a 60 interest in the Fish Lake Valley property by paying the Company 675,000, issuing the equivalent of 500,000 worth of Morella stock, and expending 2,000,000 of exploration work in the next four years. To date Morella is current with its obligations under the formal agreement ratified on October 12th 2021, having paid our company 375,000 to date, and has issued 55,560,526 shares of Morella (1MC:ASX, Altaf:OTC-QB) common stock pursuant to the terms of the agreement. In the last couple of years Morella has completed two phases of passive seismic and magnetotelluric (MT) surveys and received permits for drilling on both the south and northern blocks. Preparatory work for drilling was done on the south block in fall 2022, and surface casing installed, while at the north block pad construction was done during the summer of 2023, and drilling commenced in early October. One hole was drilled here to the northeast of the playa, away from the area of known mineralization, and only moderate lithium mineralization was encountered in clays and weak lithium mineralization encountered in brines. 19 Table of Contents San Emidio Property The San Emidio property, located in Washoe County in northwestern Nevada, was acquired through the staking of claims in September 2011. The four, 80-acre, Association Placer claims currently held here cover an area of approximately 320 acres (129.50 hectares). The claim block has expanded and contracted a couple of times, in accordance with the state of the Lithium market. The property is approximately 65 miles north-northeast of Reno, Nevada, and has excellent infrastructure. We developed this prospect during 2009, and 2010 through surface sampling, and the early reconnaissance sampling determined that anomalous values for lithium occur in the playa sediments over a good portion of the playa. This sampling appeared to indicate that the most prospective areas on the playa may be on the newly staked block proximal to the southern margin of the basin, where it is possible the structures that are responsible for the geothermal system here may also have influenced lithium deposition in sediments. Our company conducted near-surface brine sampling in the spring of 2011, and a high resolution gravity geophysical survey in summer/fall 2011. Our company then permitted a 7 hole drilling program with the Bureau of Land Management in late fall 2011, and a direct push drill program was commenced in early February 2012. Drilling here delineated a narrow elongated shallow brine reservoir which is greater than 2.5 miles length, and which is adjacent to a basinal feature outlined by the earlier gravity survey. Two values of over 20 milligrams/liter lithium were obtained from two holes located centrally in this brine anomaly. Most recently we drilled this prospect in late October 2012, further testing the area of the property in the vicinity where prior exploration by our company discovered elevated lithium levels in subsurface brines. During the 2012 program a total of 856 feet (260.89 meters) was drilled at 8 discrete sites. The deepest hole was 160 feet (48.76 meters), and the shallowest hole that produced brine was 90 feet (27.43 meters). The average depth of the seven hole program was 107 feet (32.61 meters). The program better defined a lithium-in-brine anomaly that was discovered in early 2012. This anomaly is approximately 0.6 miles (370 meters) wide at its widest point by more than 2 miles (3 kilometers) long. The peak value seen within the anomaly is 23.7 mg/l lithium, which is 10 to 20 times background levels outside the anomaly. Our company believes that, much like Fish Lake Valley, the playa at San Emidio may be conducive to the formation of a Silver Peak style lithium brine deposit, and the recent drilling indicates that the anomaly occurs at or near the intersection of several faults that may have provided the structural setting necessary for the formation of a lithium-in-brine deposit at depth. In 2016 we signed an Exploration Earn-In Agreement with 1067323 B.C. Ltd. with respect to our San Emidio property. 1067323 B.C. Ltd., could have acquired an initial 80 undivided interest in the San Emidio property through the payment of an aggregate of US 100,000 in cash, completing a Going Public Transaction and subject to the completion of the Going Public Transaction, arranging for the issuance of a total of 300,000 common shares in the capital of the Resulting Issuer as follows: Within 30 days of the Effective Date pay 100,000 to our company and issue 100,000 common shares of the TSX-V listed public company. On or before the first anniversary of the signing of the Definitive Agreement issue 100,000 common shares of the Optionee/TSX-V listed public company. On or before the second anniversary of the signing of the definitive agreement issue 100,000 common shares of the Optionee/TSX-V listed public company. 20 Table of Contents The Optionee had to have made qualified exploration or development expenditures on the property of 100,000 before the first anniversary, an additional 200,000 before the second anniversary, an additional 300,000 prior to the third anniversary, and make all payments and perform all other acts to maintain the Property in good standing before fully earning their 80 interest. Additionally, Optionee has the right to purchase our 20 interest in the property for 1,000,000, at which point our interest would revert to a 2 1/2 Net Smelter Royalty (NSR). The Optionee may then elect at any time to purchase one half of our NSR for 1,000,000. On May 24, 2016, 1067323 B.C. Ltd. was acquired by American Lithium Corp.(TSXV: LI) In connection with the acquisition of 1067323 and in accordance with the Exploration Earn-In Agreement, 100,000 common shares were issued to our company. In addition, we received payment of 100,000. To date the Company had received 200,000 shares of American Lithium as consideration under this option agreement. American Lithium Corp did not conduct any appreciable exploration work on this prospect, and the Company waived the 100,000 exploration expenditure provision for Year 1 of the option agreement. In early June 2018 the Company was notified that American Lithium was allowing the option earn-in to lapse. The Company received a drilling permit from the BLM in Winnemucca, for up to 3 RC drill holes here, and the Company was intent on drilling these in 2019, however with the downturn in the Lithium market at that point exploration here was put on hold. On September 16 th 2021 Lithium Corporation signed an agreement with Surge Battery Metals whereby Surge may earn an 80 interest in the Company s San Emidio lithium-in-brine prospect in Washoe County Nevada, by paying an initial 50,000 and issuing 200,000 shares of Surge (TSX-V:Nili). Surge had undertaken to make payments of 620,000 in cash and stock over 5 years while incurring expenditures on the property of 1,000,000 over that period. Upon fulfillment of the aforementioned commitments Surge would have been deemed to have earned their undivided 80 interest and could have formed a joint venture with the Company. Surge Battery Metals completed some geochemical work on the prospect block and gave Lithium Corporation formal notice in Summer 2022 that they were relinquishing all interest in the property. In Fall 2022 the Company completed a Controlled Source Audio-Magnetotelluric (CSAMT) survey on the property, and is currently considering next steps with respect to exploring and developing this property. BC Sugar Flake Graphite Property On June 6, 2013, we entered into a mining claim sale agreement with Herb Hyder wherein Mr. Hyder agreed to sell to our company a 50.829 acre (20.57 hectare) claim located in the Cherryville area of British Columbia. As consideration for the purchase of the property, we issued 250,000 shares of our company s common stock to Mr. Hyder. In addition to the acquired claim, our company staked or acquired another 13 claims at various times over the subsequent months, to bring the total area held under tenure to approximately 19,816 acres (8,020 hectares). The flake graphite mineralization of interest here is hosted predominately in graphitic quartz/biotite, and lesser graphitic calc-silicate gneisses. The rocks in the general area of the BC Sugar prospect are similar to the host rocks in the area of the Crystal Graphite deposit 55 miles (90 kms) to the southeast. Over the past three years the claim block here has been strategically decreased, and the Company currently holds one tenure encompassing 203 acres (82.23 hectares). The BC Sugar property is within in the Shushwap Metamorphic Complex, in a geological environment favorable for the formation of flake graphite deposits, and is in an area of excellent logistics, with a considerable network of logging roads within the project area. Additionally the town of Lumby is approximately 19 miles (30 kms) to the south of the property, while the City of Vernon is only 30 miles (50 kms) to the southwest of the western portions of the claim block. We received final assays from the October 2013 prospecting and geological program at the BC Sugar property in December of 2013. That work increased the area known to be underlain by graphitic bearing gneisses, and further evaluations were made in the area of the Sugar Lake, Weather Station, and Taylor Creek showings. In the general vicinity of the Weather Station showing, a further 13 samples were taken, and hand trenching was performed at one of several outcrops in the area. In the trench a 5.2 meter interval returned an average of 3.14 graphitic carbon, all in an oxidized relatively friable gneissic host rock. Additionally a hydrothermal or vein type mineralized graphitic quartz boulder was discovered in the area which graded up to 4.19 graphitic carbon. The source of this boulder was not discovered during this program, but it is felt to be close to its point of origin. Samples representative of the mineralization encountered here were taken for petrographic study, which was received in late 2013. A brief assessment work program was performed in September 2014 to ensure all claims in the package were in good standing prior to the anticipated sale of this asset to Pathion Inc. Recommendations were made by the consulting geologist who wrote the assessment report with respect to trenching, and eventually drilling the Weather Station showing. Our company submitted a Notice of Work to the BC Government in early May 2015 to enable our company to conduct a program of excavator trenching, sampling and geological mapping on the Weather Station showing. In May of 2015 we signed an agreement with KLM Geosciences LLC of Las Vegas to conduct a short Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey on the property in the Weather Station Taylor Creek areas. The GPR survey as well as a GEM-2 electromagnetic (EM) survey took place in approximately mid-May 2015. The GPR survey did not provide useful data because of the moisture saturation in the shallow subsurface. The EM survey successfully generated an anomaly over known mineralization as well as extended the anomaly to the west under an area of cover consisting of glacial/fluvial till. Lithium Corporation is pleased with the results of the EM survey and has modified our work plans to include additional work that builds on the results of this survey. 21 Table of Contents In August of 2015 our Notice of Work for trenching was approved by the BC Government and in October we commenced work. A trench of 265.76 feet (81 meters) was excavated and graphitic gneiss was mapped and sampled. In all 23 samples were taken over the 69 meters of exposed mineralization that could be safely sampled. Trench depths varied from 1.2 meters in areas of semi-consolidated rock to 4.8 meters in areas of mainly decomposed material. There was an approximately 12 meter section of the trench of sand, and fluvial till in an ancient stream bed where the excavator could not reach the graphitic material that is inferred to exist at depths greater than 5 meters. Also there was a 4 meter section at depths from 4.8 to 5 meters where graphite mineralization could be seen at depth, but could not be safely sampled. The entire 69 meter interval that was sampled averaged 1.997 graphitic carbon, and mineralization remains open in all directions. Within that interval there was a 30 meter section that averaged 2.73 graphitic carbon, and within that interval there was a 12 meter section that averaged 2.99 graphitic carbon. The best mineralization, and most friable material is proximal to the aforementioned abandoned creek channel, and it appears that proximity to this feature gave rise to the deep weathering profile encountered here. Determining the tenor, and extent of the friable material were the two major objectives of this program as this material, which is very similar to that mined at Eagle Graphite s operation is very easy/economical to be mined and processed, and typically contains the highest percentages of graphite over consistent widths. The Company revised its trenching permit in 2017 and conducted a program of 12 mechanized test pits in May 2018. This work was done in an area ranging from 1 to 1.5 kilometers to the east of the Weather Station Zone in a zone of numerous discrete conductors detected during the 2015 FDEM geophysical survey. Three of these pits intercepted weathered weak to moderately mineralized graphitic material with the best assay being 2.62 graphitic, carbon, and six test pits bottomed in non-mineralized bedrock. The remaining three did not reach bedrock or intercept graphitic material prior to reaching the maximum digging capability of the excavating equipment used. The Company has recently reduced its acreage holdings here to approximately 102 acres 41 hectares), and placed it on the back burner in favor of developing other prospects that are of greater commercial interest due to the significant drop in graphite products values during 2023. North Big Smoky Property During the period 2011 through 2012 the Company conducted geophysical, and geochemical work on BLM lands in North Big Smoky Valley, Nye County Nevada, in an area that proved to be geochemically anomalous, both in sediment and brines. The geological setting in this area is quite similar to that at our other brine prospects, and Clayton Valley to the southwest of here, and had experienced some geothermal and petroleum exploration in the past. In April of 2016 Lithium Royalty Corp (a wholly owned subsidiary through which we had planned to build a portfolio of lithium mineral properties) acquired the prospect through staking a block of placer mineral claims here. On May 13, 2016 our wholly owned subsidiary sold 100 of the interest in the property to 1069934 Nevada Ltd. ("Purchaser") a private company. Consideration paid to Lithium Royalty Corp. consisted of mainly of 300,000 shares in the "Purchaser Parent", 1069934 B.C. Ltd, and retained a royalty on the property. No appreciable work was done and by agreement dated September 13, 2017 Lithium Corporation agreed to sell back the shares of 1069934 Nevada Ltd. to San Antone Minerals Corp (successor corporation) who subsequently allowed the claims here to lapse. On May 11, 2022 we signed a letter of agreement with Morella Corporation a related party whereby Morella can earn a 60 interest in our North Big Smoky lithium-in-brine property by paying 65,000 US to the Company on the signing of the LOI, and issuing 100,000 worth of Morella shares at the time of signing the formal agreement, and issue a similar dollar value of shares at the anniversary of the signing of the formal agreement over the next four years. Additionally Morella must make exploration expenditures of 100,000, 200,000, 300,000 and 400,000 in years one through four of the option agreement. Should they fulfill these obligations they will have earned an undivided 60 interest in the property and may purchase a further 20 interest within 1 year for 750,000, and purchase the remaining 20 interest within the following year for 750,000. Should Morella buy Lithium Corporation s undivided working interest in the property, the Company will revert to a 2.5 Net Smelter Royalty interest, of which would be purchasable by Morella for 1,000,000. This area was subsequently re-staked by Lithium Corporation in early 2022. Since Optioning the property Morella has conducted Controlled Source Audio-Magnetotelluric geophysical and sediment geochemical surveys, staked more claims adjacent to the original option claim block as well as staking a non-contiguous area to the north and west of the earlier claims here. Most recently Morella has concluded a two-hole drilling program on the property, wherein anomalous lithium-in-clay mineralization was encountered. 22 Table of Contents The Hughes Claims Effective April 23, 2014, we entered into an operating agreement with All American Resources, L.L.C and TY Sons Investments Inc. with respect to Summa, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company incorporated on December 12, 2013, wherein we hold a 25 membership in a number of patented mining claims that spring from the once vast holdings of Howard Hughes. Our company s initial capital contribution paid to Summa, LLC was 125,000, of which 100,000 was in cash and the balance in services. To date Lithium Corporation has received 167,500 in cash disbursements from Summa, LLC since 2021. Our company participated in the formation of Summa, which originally held 88 fee-title patented lode claims, covering approximately 1,191.3 acres of prospective mineral lands, governed by a joint operating agreement with the other participants. Our company s president, Tom Lewis, is a managing member of Summa. The Hughes lands are situated in six discrete prospect areas in Nevada, the most notable of which being the Tonopah block in Nye County where Summa holds 56 claims that cover approximately 770 acres in the heart of the historic mining camp where over 1.8 million ounces of gold and 174 million ounces of silver were produced predominately in the early 1900 s. The Hughes claims include a number of the prolific past producers in Tonopah, such as the Belmont, the Desert Queen, and the Midway mines. In addition there are also claims in the area of the past producing Klondyke East mining district, which is to the south of Tonopah, and at the town of Belmont (not to be confused with the Belmont claim in Tonopah), Nevada, another notable silver producer from the 1800 s, which is roughly 40 miles to the northeast of Tonopah. The ongoing litigation with respect to Summa s Tonopah holdings had precluded investing time or money into the property immediately after the court awarded Summa ownership in 2013, however in 2018 Summa won a quiet title case in the Fifth Judicial Court in Tonopah, which determined that Summa s title is superior to all other claimants. The subsequent appeal of this verdict was quashed later in 2018, and there has been no further action on that account. Summa signed a Letter of Intent on January 14, 2020 with respect to the Tonopah property whereby 1237025 BC Ltd, could earn a 100 interest in the property (subject to a 1.0 Net Smelter Royalty or NSR) by paying 400,000 in cash, issuing 400,000 in shares, and incurring 1.5 million in exploration expenditures in stages over the next 5 years. The Optionee also has the right to purchase of the NSR for 1,500,000, and the future right to purchase a further of the NSR for 2,500,000. The definitive agreement was signed in March of 2020, and 1237025 BC Ltd subsequently merged with Pinnacle North Gold Corp., who then changed their name to Summa Silver Corp. Summa Silver actively explored the property in the second half of 2020, drilling roughly 14,000 meters in 29 drill holes. Additionally more work was performed on the Belmont tailings portion of the project aided by Lithium Corporation personnel, who have been actively promoting and advancing this aspect of the Tonopah holdings since acquisition. In 2021 Summa Silver accelerated the earn-in provisions of the option agreement and was transferred a 100 interest in the property. Summa still retains a 1 (LTUM s undivided share 0.25 Net Smelter Royalty on the property. Recently Summa entered into an agreement with Electric Metals (USA) Limited (formerly Nevada Silver Corporation) with respect to Summa s Belmont Nevada claims whereby EML can earn a 100 interest by paying 200,000 in cash or at Optionor s discretion shares over 5 years, and election must be made by the sixth agreement anniversary to purchase the lands (69.96 acres) at 10,000 per acre. Should EML earn their interest Summa, LLC would retain a 1 Net Smelter Royalty 50 of which may be subsequently purchased by the Optionor. Summa, LLC still retains a 100 interest (subject to a 2 NSR in favor of Summa Corp. (the successor entity to the Hughes Corporation) in a further five project areas in the state of Nevada, and Lithium Corporation remains committed to casually helping them move the projects along so that they may be optioned eventually. We are currently pursuing other properties which are believed to be prospective for hosting lithium, graphite, fluorine, nickle - cobalt and Rare Earth Element mineralization, as well as evaluating a wide range of opportunities brought to our company by third parties. Additionally our company continues its generative program exploring for new deposits of next generation battery related materials. Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 We had net loss of 279,108 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, which was 107,272 more than the net loss of 171,836 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. The change in our results over the two periods is primarily the result of an increase in consulting fees, exploration expense and change in fair value of marketable securities. 23 Table of Contents The following table summarizes key items of comparison and their related increase (decrease) for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Change Between Three Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 Professional fees 11,347 15,575 (4,228 Depreciation 1,833 1,833 - Exploration expenses 69,792 34,875 34,917 Consulting fees related party 87,000 76,000 11,000 Consulting fees 17,000 16,200 800 Transfer agent and filing fees 5,128 11,719 (6,591 Travel 3,935 3,060 875 General and administrative 5,253 8,966 (3,713 Other loss (income) 77,820 3,608 74,212 Net loss (income) 279,108 171,836 107,272 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 We had a net loss of 812,883 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, which was 221,946 more than the net loss of 590,937 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 reflects current assets of 3,277,962. We had cash in the amount of 3,277,962 and working capital in the amount of 1,044,280 as of September 30, 2024. We have sufficient working capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months. 24 Table of Contents Working Capital At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Current assets 3,277,962 4,023,249 Current liabilities 2,233,682 2,225,977 Working capital 1,044,280 1,797,272 We anticipate generating losses and, therefore, may be unable to continue operations further in the future. Cash Flows Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) operating activities (472,018 (312,057 Net cash provided by investing activities - 140,082 Net cash provided by financing activities - 334,281 Net increase (decrease) in cash during period (472,018 162,306 Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 472,018, an increase of 159,961 from the 312,057 net cash outflow during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was Nil, which was a 140,082 change from the 140,082 cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was Nil as compared to 334,281 in cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We estimate that our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next 12 months to be as follows: Estimated Net Expenditures During The Next Twelve Months General and administrative expenses 461,000 Exploration expenses 500,000 Travel 30,000 Total 891,000 To date we have relied on proceeds from the sale of our shares in order to sustain our basic, minimum operating expenses; however, we cannot guarantee that we will secure any further sales of our shares or that our sole officer and/or directors will provide us with any future loans. We estimate that the cost of maintaining basic corporate operations (which includes the cost of satisfying our public reporting obligations) will be approximately 4,500 per month. Due to our current cash position of approximately 3,195,000 as of September 30, 2024, we estimate that we do have sufficient cash to sustain our basic operations for the next twelve months. We are not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. 25 Table of Contents Equity Financings On January 25, 2021 we entered into a purchase agreement (the " Purchase Agreement "), and a registration rights agreement, (the " Registration Rights Agreement "), with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (" Lincoln Park "), pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to 10,300,000 of the Company's common stock, 0.001 par value per share (the " Common Stock "). In connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company sold, and Lincoln Park purchased, 380,952 shares of Common Stock for a purchase price of 160,000 Original Purchase ), and then another 357,995 shares Initial Purchase for 150,000 after SEC approval of the S-1 document in April 2021. Due to our low share price at the beginning of 2024 the Company ceased using this source of funding, and this arrangement ended in April of 2024, with Lithium Corporation having issued a total of 22,979,458 shares for 4,101,888.15. Future Financings We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities. While we are always examining all possible opportunities to fund the Company on a prudent and cautious basis, we currently have no arrangement for future financings. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, and capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies Exploration Stage Company The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles related to accounting and reporting by exploration stage companies. An exploration stage company is one in which planned principal operations have not commenced or if its operations have commenced, there has been no significant revenues there from. Accounting Basis Our company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP" accounting). Our company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash includes cash on account, demand deposits, and short-term instruments with maturities of three months or less. Concentrations of Credit Risk Our company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. Our company continually monitors its banking relationships and consequently has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Our company believes we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. 26 Table of Contents Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Our company has yet to realize revenues from operations. Once our company has commenced operations, we will recognize revenues when delivery of goods or completion of services has occurred provided there is persuasive evidence of an agreement, acceptance has been approved by its customers, the fee is fixed or determinable based on the completion of stated terms and conditions, and collection of any related receivable is probable. Loss per Share Basic loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted earnings per share assumes the conversion, exercise or contingent issuance of securities only when such conversion, exercise or issuance would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the "if converted" method. In the periods in which a loss is incurred, the effect of potential issuances of shares under options and warrants would be anti-dilutive, and therefore basic and diluted losses per share are the same. The Company did not have any dilutive securities for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Income Taxes The asset and liability approach is used to account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Financial Instruments Our company's financial instruments consist of cash, deposits, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Unless otherwise noted, it is management's opinion that our company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. Because of the short maturity and capacity of prompt liquidation of such assets and liabilities, the fair value of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values, unless otherwise noted. Mineral Properties Costs of exploration, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized including licenses and lease payments. Although our company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, these procedures do not guarantee our company's title. Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title may be affected by undetected defects. Impairment losses are recorded on mineral properties used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. Impairment of 0 and 0 was recorded during the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-01, "Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and are to be adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. Our company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. 27 Table of Contents Item 3.
