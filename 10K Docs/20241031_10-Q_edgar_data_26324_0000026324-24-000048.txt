 Contract Balances 
 
 Timing of revenue recognition and cash collection may result in billed receivables, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and deferred revenue (contract liabilities) on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporation s contract assets primarily relate to its rights to consideration for work completed but not billed as of the reporting date. Contract assets are transferred to billed receivables when the rights to consideration become unconditional. This is typical in situations where amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms or upon achievement of contractual milestones. The Corporation s contract liabilities primarily consist of customer advances received prior to revenue being earned. Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included in the contract liabilities

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION and ANALYSIS of 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION and RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 

COMPANY ORGANIZATION 
 
 Curtiss-Wright Corporation along with its subsidiaries is a global integrated business that provides highly engineered products, solutions, and services mainly to aerospace defense markets, as well as critical technologies in demanding commercial power, process, and industrial markets. We report our operations through our Aerospace Industrial, Defense Electronics, and Naval Power segments. We operate across a diversified array of niche markets through engineering and technological leadership, precision manufacturing, and strong relationships with our customers. Approximately 69 of our 2024 revenues are expected to be generated from A D-related markets. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of the Corporation for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024. The financial information as of September 30, 2024 should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 contained in our Form 10-K. 
 
 The MD A is organized into the following sections: Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Results by Business Segment, and Liquidity and Capital Resources. Our discussion will be focused on the overall results of operations followed by a more detailed discussion of those results within each of our reportable segments. 
 
 Our three reportable segments are generally concentrated in a few end markets; however, each may have sales across several end markets. An end market is defined as an area of demand for products and services. The sales for the relevant markets will be discussed throughout the MD A. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, we conducted actions associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program across all of our segments in an effort to improve operating efficiency. These actions, which primarily include workforce reductions, consolidation of facilities, and costs related to legal entity restructuring, resulted in pre-tax charges of approximately 3 million and 8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company anticipates that these actions, which are expected to be substantially completed by June 30, 2025, will result in annual operating cost savings of approximately 10 million. 
 
 Analytical Definitions 
 
 Throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, the terms incremental and organic are used to explain changes from period to period. The term incremental is used to highlight the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the current year results. The results of operations for acquisitions are incremental for the first twelve months from the date of acquisition. The definition of organic excludes the effects of costs associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program and foreign currency translation.

Operating income in the third quarter increased 12 million, or 9 , to 145 million, while operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 18.1 compared with the same period in 2023. Operating income and operating margin in the Defense Electronics segment primarily benefited from favorable overhead absorption on higher A D sales. In the Aerospace Industrial segment, favorable overhead absorption on higher sales was essentially offset by current period restructuring costs and unfavorable product mix. In the Naval Power segment, operating income increased while operating margin decreased, as favorable overhead absorption on higher sales as well as the absence of first year purchase accounting costs from our arresting systems acquisition were partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the timing of development programs. 
 
 Operating income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 50 million, or 15 , to 374 million, and operating margin increased 60 basis points to 16.3 , compared with the same period in 2023. In the Defense Electronics segment, increases in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to favorable overhead absorption on higher A D sales, favorable product mix, as well as the benefit of our cost containment initiatives. In the Aerospace Industrial segment, both operating income and operating margin decreased, as f avorable overhead absorption on higher sales was partially offset by current period restructuring costs and unfavorable product mix. In the Naval Power segment, operating income increased while operating margin decreased, as favorable overhead absorption on higher sales as well as the absence of first year purchase accounting costs from our arresting systems acquisition were essentially offset by an unfavorable naval contract adjustment, unfavorable product mix, and the timing of development programs. 
 
 Non-segment operating expense in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1 million, or 11 , to 9 million, and 2 million, or 5 , to 31 million, primarily due to lower foreign currency losses against the comparable prior year periods. 
 
 Interest expense in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1 million, or 9 , to 11 million, and 7 million, or 18 , to 33 million, respectively, primarily due to lower borrowings under our revolving Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement or credit facility ). Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also benefited from the repayment of our 2013 Notes in February 2023. 
 
 Other income, net in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3 million, or 44 , to 10 million, and 6 million, or 24 , to 28 million, respectively, primarily due to higher interest income and lower overall pension costs against the comparable prior year periods. 
 
 The effective tax rate of 22.6 in the third quarter decreased compared to an effective tax rate of 23.8 in the prior year period. The effective tax rate of 22.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased as compared to an effective tax rate of 23.4 . Decreases in both of the comparable periods were primarily due to the benefits of a legal entity restructuring as well as lower provisional tax expense associated with foreign withholding taxes. 
 
 Comprehensive income in the third quarter was 141 million, compared to comprehensive income of 69 million in the prior year period. The change was primarily due to the following: 
 
 Foreign currency translation adjustments in the third quarter resulted in a 31 million comprehensive gain, compared to a 28 million comprehensive loss in the prior year period. The comprehensive gain during the current period was primarily attributed to increases in t he British Pound. 
 Net earnings increas ed 14 million , primarily due to higher operating income. 
 
 Comprehensive income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 297 million, compared to comprehensive income of 240 million in the prior year period. The change was primarily due to the following: 
 
 Net earnings increased 53 million, pr imarily due to higher operating income. 
 Foreign currenc y translation adjustments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in a 10 million comprehensive gain, c ompared to a 6 million comprehensive gain in the prior period. The co mprehensive gain during the current period was primarily attributed to increases in the British Pound. 
 
 New orders in the third quarter increased 15 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an increase in orders for defense electronics products in the Defense Electronics segment and an increase in orders for sensors products and surface treatment services within our A D markets in the Aerospace Industrial segment.

higher demand on various submarine programs as well as higher foreign military sales. Sales in the commercial aerospace market primarily benefited from higher demand for OEM sensors and actuation products, surface treatment services on narrowbody and widebody platforms, as well as avionics equipment on various platforms. 
 
 Commercial markets 
 Sales in the third quarter of 233 million were essentially flat against the comparable prior year period. Sales in the power process market benefited from higher commercial nuclear aftermarket sales supporting the maintenance of operating reactors in the United States. This increase was essentially offset by lower sales of industrial vehicle products to off-highway vehicle platforms in the general industrial market. 
 
 Sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4 million, or 1 , to 698 million. Sales in the power process market primarily benefited from higher commercial nuclear aftermarket sales supporting the maintenance of operating reactors in North America, partially offset by the wind-down on the China Direct AP1000 program. The general industrial market was negatively impacted by lower sales of industrial vehicle products to off-highway vehicle platforms. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Sources and Use of Cash 
 
 We derive the majority of our operating cash inflow from receipts on the sale of goods and services and cash outflow for the procurement of materials and labor; cash flow is therefore subject to market fluctuations and conditions. Most of our long-term contracts allow for several billing points (progress or milestone) that provide us with cash receipts as costs are incurred throughout the project rather than upon contract completion, thereby reducing working capital requirements. In some cases, these payments can exceed the costs incurred on a project.

 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 77 million from the prior year period, primarily due to higher cash earnings and improved working capital. 
 
 Net cash used for investing activities increased 39 million from the prior year period, primarily due to our acquisition of WSC. 
 
 Net cash used for financing activities decreased 102 million from the prior year period, primarily due to the repayment of our 2013 Notes in February 2023. This decrease was partially offset by higher share repurchases during the current period. Refer to the "Financing Activities" section below for further details. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Debt 
 
 The Corporation s debt outstanding had an average interest rate of 3.8 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 4.0 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Corporation s average debt outstanding was 1.0 billion for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 1.1 billion and 1.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION and RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 

Credit Agreement 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had 20 million in letters of credit supported by the Credit Agreement. The unused credit available under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 was 730 million, which could be borrowed without violating any of our debt covenants. 
 
 Repurchase of common stock 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation used 138 million of cash to repurchase approximately 0.5 million outstanding shares under its share repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Corporation used 37 million of cash to repurchase approximately 0.2 million outstanding shares under its share repurchase program. 
 
 Cash Utilization 
 
 Management continually evaluates cash utilization alternatives, including share repurchases, acquisitions, and increased dividends to determine the most beneficial use of available capital resources. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, available borrowings under the credit facility, and ability to raise additional capital through the credit markets are sufficient to meet both the short-term and long-term capital needs of the organization. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 The Corporation made dividend payments of 16 million and 15 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Additionally, beginning in the second quarter of 2024, the Corporation increased its quarterly dividend to 0.21 per share. 
 
 Debt Compliance 
 
 As of the date of this report, we were in compliance with all debt agreements and credit facility covenants, including our most restrictive covenant, which is our debt to capitalization limit of 60 . The debt to capitalization limit is a measure of our indebtedness (as defined per the notes purchase agreement and credit facility) to capitalization, where capitalization equals debt plus equity, and is the same for and applies to all of our debt agreements and credit facility. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow additional debt of 2.6 billion without violating our debt to capitalization covenant.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. A summary of significant accounting policies and a description of accounting policies that are considered critical may be found in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 20, 2024, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, and the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 There have been no material changes in our market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Information regarding market risk and market risk management policies is more fully described in "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2024 insofar as they are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and they include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Page 31 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our business. Some of these proceedings allege damages relating to asbestos and environmental exposures, intellectual property matters, copyright infringement, personal injury claims, employment and employee benefit matters, government contract issues, commercial or contractual disputes, and acquisitions or divestitures. We continue to defend vigorously against all claims. Although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based on present information, including assessment of the merits of the particular claim, as well as current accruals and insurance coverage, we do not believe that the disposition of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 We have been named in pending lawsuits that allege injury from exposure to asbestos. To date, we have not been found liable or paid any material sum of money in settlement in any asbestos-related case. We believe that the minimal use of asbestos in our past operations and the relatively non-friable condition of asbestos in our products make it unlikely that we will face material liability in any asbestos litigation, whether individually or in the aggregate. We maintain insurance coverage for these potential liabilities and we believe adequate coverage exists to cover any unanticipated asbestos liability. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 There have been no material changes in our Risk Factors during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Information regarding our Risk Factors is more fully described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

 In November 2023, the Corporation adopted two written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The first trading plan includes share repurchases of 50 million, to be executed equally throughout the 2024 calendar year. The second trading plan includes opportunistic share repurchases up to 100 million during 2024 to be executed through a 10b5-1 program. The Corporation implemented these written trading plans in connection with its previously authorized 550 million share repurchase program on September 16, 2021 (the 2021 Share Repurchase Authorization ).
