In particular, the words such as believe, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, may, will, can, plan, predict, could, future, continue, variations of such words, the negative of these terms and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. 
 
 Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are based on management s current expectations and projections about future events, are not guarantees of future performance, are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and apply only as of the date of this Report. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from historical results as well as from the results expressed in, anticipated or implied by these forward-looking statements. An occurrence of, or any material adverse change in, one or more of the risk factors or risks and uncertainties referred to in this Report or included in our other public disclosures or our other periodic reports or other documents or filings filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Any public statements or disclosures by us following this Report that modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements contained in this Report will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this Report. 
 
 In particular, our business, including our financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: 

Our ability to successfully execute on our growth strategy and operating plans; 

Our ability to continue to effectively utilize the proceeds from our financings completed during the quarter ended September 30, 2024; 

Our ability to manage our operating expenses and generate cash flow from operations, along with our ability to secure additional financing if our sales goals take longer to achieve than anticipated; 

Our ability to create and maintain brand name recognition and acceptance of our products, which is critical to our success in our competitive, brand-conscious industry; 

Our ability to compete successfully against much larger, well-funded, established companies currently operating in the beverage industry generally, including in the fountain business, particularly from other major beverage companies; 

Entrance into and increased focus on the craft beverage segment by other major beverage companies;

Our ability to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key flavor suppliers; 

Our ability to attract and retain key personnel, the loss of whom would directly affect our efficiency and operations and could materially impair our ability to execute our growth strategy; 

Our ability to protect our trademarks and trade secrets, the failure of which may prevent us from successfully marketing our products and competing effectively; 

Litigation or legal proceedings, which could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation; 

Our ability to comply with the many regulations to which our business is subject; 

Our ability to maintain an effective information technology infrastructure; 

Our ability to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and effectively address investigations and administrative actions by government regulators with jurisdiction over our products;

 (Unaudited) 

million and million, respectively, and working capital of approximately million and million, respectively. Net cash used in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled million and approximately million, respectively. We incurred a net loss of approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our accumulated deficit increased to million as of September 30, 2024 compared to an accumulated deficit of million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million, most significantly due to the proceeds from our issuance of common stock from the Private Placement (as defined below) described in Note 3. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities totaled due to repayments on our insurance financing agreement. 
 
 We have experienced recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities. These factors initially raised substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. On May 17, 2024, the Company signed a financing agreement from a creditor to provide the Company with a million revolving credit facility for working capital needs (See Note 7 ). Additionally, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 the Company closed a private placement equity raise for net proceeds of 3.7 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses (the Private Placement (See Note 3 ). 
 
 Based on management's current operating plan, the Company believes its cash and cash equivalents on hand, projected cash generated from product sales, proceeds from Private Placement, and funds available from the revolving credit facility are sufficient to fund the Company's operations for a period of at least 12 months subsequent to the issuance of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and alleviates the conditions that initially raised substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received and nil, respectively from the cash exercise of stock options. From time to time, we may receive additional cash through the exercise of stock options or stock warrants. However, we cannot predict the timing or amount of cash proceeds we may receive from the exercise, if at all, of any of the outstanding stock options or warrants. 

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sales tax and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. 
 
 See Note 1, to the 12/31/2023 audited financial statements included in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10 -K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 for our revenue recognition policy. 
 
 Revenue is recorded net of provisions for discounts, slotting fees payable by us to retailers to stock our products and promotional allowances. Discounts, slotting fees and promotional allowances vary the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the sale of products to distributors. We estimate these discounts, slotting fees and promotional allowances in the same period that the revenue is recognized for product sales to customers. These estimates are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgement with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. The amount of revenue recognized represents the amount that will not be subject to a significant future reversal of revenue. The liability for promotional allowances is included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. Amounts paid for slotting fees are recorded as prepaid expenses on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the corresponding term. For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our revenue was reduced by million and , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our revenue was reduced by million and million, respectively, in each case for slotting fees and promotion allowances. 
 
 All sales to distributors and customers are generally final. In limited instances we may accept returned product due to quality issues or distributor terminations, and in such situations we would have variable consideration. To date, returns have not been material. Our customers generally pay within 30 days from the receipt of a valid invoice. We offer prompt pay discounts of up to to certain customers typically for payments made within 15 days. Prompt pay discounts are estimated in the period of sale based on experience with sales to eligible customers. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, prompt pay discounts to these customers were considered immaterial to the related accounts receivable balances presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The accounts receivable balance primarily includes balances from trades sales to distributors and retail customers. The allowance for credit losses is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance for credit losses based primarily on current trends and estimates. The Company reserves a percentage of trade receivable balances based on collection history and current economic trends that the Company expects will impact the level of credit losses over the life of the receivables. These reserves are re-evaluated on a regular basis and adjusted as needed. Account balances that are deemed uncollectible are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. Allowances for credit losses of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were netted against accounts receivable. No impairment losses were recognized for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023. Changes in accounts receivable are primarily due to the timing and magnitude of orders for products, the timing of when control of products is transferred to distributors and the timing of cash collections. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no customers that accounted for a material concentration amount of our accounts receivable. 
 
 and shares, outstanding warrants of and shares, and outstanding restricted stock units of and shares, respectively, were anti-dilutive. 

Raw materials 

Finished goods primarily include product ready for shipment, as well as promotional merchandise held for sale. Raw materials primarily include ingredients, concentrate and packaging. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded obsolete inventory expenses of and , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded obsolete inventory expenses of and , respectively. 

shares of the Company s common stock, plus (ii) the number of shares of common stock reserved, but unissued under the 2011 Plan, plus (iii) the number of shares of common stock underlying forfeited awards under the 2011 Plan are initially available for issuance as awards under the 2022 Plan. 
 
 shares of common stock reserved under the terms of our 2011 Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan but unissued were transferred to the reserve for the 2022 Plan. Thus, the total number of shares of common stock authorized under the 2022 Plan was shares. The 2022 Plan is subject to an annual increase on the first day of each calendar year beginning with the first January 1 following the effective date of the 2022 Plan and ending with the last January 1 during the initial ten -year term of the 2022 Plan, equal to the lesser of (A) of the shares of the Company s common stock outstanding (which includes shares issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all outstanding securities or rights convertible into or exercisable for shares, including, without limitation, preferred stock, warrants and employee options to purchase any shares) on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year and (B) such lesser number of shares of common stock as determined by our Board of Directors. 
 
 Under the terms of the 2022 Plan, the Board may grant awards to employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors. Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant, and generally have a ten -year term. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares of unissued common stock authorized and available for future awards under the 2022 Plan. 
 
 (a) Stock options: 

A summary of our stock option activity is as follows: 

Options granted

 Options forfeited/expired

(b) Restricted stock awards: 

In May 2023, the Board of Director compensation structure consisted of an annual grant of stock options to each non-employee director each year for service on the Board and an additional stock options as annual compensation for non-employee directors who serve as chair of a Board committee. All stock options granted to non-employee directors vest incrementally in equal amounts over a three year period from the date of issuance. 
 
 In 2024, the Board determined that it was in the best interests of the Company to revise the Board of Director compensation plan. It was determined that each director shall receive compensation consisting of restricted stock unit RSU grants, with the value of each RSU calculated based on the five day volume-weighted average price of the Company s shares common stock on the OTCQB during the five trading days immediately preceding January 1, 2024. Based on this value of each RSU, the total grant will consist of (i) a grant of RSUs to each continuing director for service on the Board during 2024; and (ii) an additional grant of RSUs to each non-employee continuing director who serves as the chair of a Board committee during 2024. These RSU grants vest as follows: on June 30, 2024, on September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2024. 
 
 A summary of our restricted stock activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows:

(c) Stock-based compensation expense: 

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the straight-line attribution method over the employees requisite service period, or the non-employee's service period based on the term of the contract. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock options or restricted stock expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee attrition. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to stock-based compensation expense may be required in future periods. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options of to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years.

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding at September 30, 2024 was approximately million and for options exercisable was million. The intrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable stock options is calculated as the quoted market price of the stock at the balance sheet date less the exercise price of the option. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately . 
 
 (d) Closing of the Pinestar Gold Inc. - Plan of Arrangement: 

On February 15, 2022, Jones issued an aggregate of shares of our common stock in connection with the completion of the Plan of Arrangement whereby the outstanding common shares of Pinestar Pinestar Shares were exchanged for newly issued shares of our common stock on a one -for- one basis. The Plan of Arrangement had previously been approved by both Pinestar s shareholders as well as by the Supreme Court of British Columbia after such court held a hearing on the fairness of the terms and conditions of the Plan of Arrangement at which all Pinestar shareholders had the right to appear.

 Overview 
 
 We develop, produce, market and distribute premium beverages that we sell and distribute primarily in North America through our network of independent distributors and directly to our national and regional retail accounts. We also currently sell premium soda beverage products in select international markets and license cannabis infused beverages and syrups in California, Washington and Canada. Our premium soda beverage products are sold primarily in grocery stores, convenience and gas stores, on fountain in restaurants, up and down the street in independent accounts such as delicatessens, sandwich shops and burger restaurants, as well as through our national accounts with several large retailers. We refer to our network of independent distributors as our direct store delivery DSD channel, and we refer to our national and regional accounts who receive shipments directly from us as our direct to retail DTR channel. We do not directly manufacture any of our premium soda beverage products, but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third-party contract manufacturers. We also sell various premium beverage soda products online, including soda with customized labels, wearables, candy and other items, and we license our trademarks for use on products sold by other manufacturers. In addition, we currently market and license several cannabis infused beverages and syrups in California, Canada, and Washington through third party manufacturers and distributors. We plan to expand our cannabis product offerings (including the development of hemp-derived Delta-9 THC products) and the states in which we offer such products. 
 
 Our Focus: Sales Growth 
 
 Our focus is sales growth through execution of the following key initiatives: 

Expand the Jones Soda glass bottle and canned products in existing and new sales channels; 

Expand our fountain and food service program in the United States and Canada; and 

Grow the Mary Jones brand, which includes Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)-infused beverages, edibles, and other related products;

Seasonality and Other Fluctuations 
 
 Our sales are seasonal and we experience fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of many factors. We historically have generated a greater percentage of our revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Sales may fluctuate materially on a quarter to quarter basis or an annual basis when we launch a new product or fill the pipeline of a new distribution partner or a large retail partner. Sales results may also fluctuate based on the number of stock keeping units or "SKUs" selected or removed by our distributors and retail partners through the normal course of serving consumers in the dynamic, trend-oriented beverage industry. As a result, management believes that period-to-period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance or results expected for the fiscal year.

Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenue 
 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, revenue decreased by approximately 286,000, or 6.36 , to approximately 4.2 million compared to approximately 4.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in sales revenue was primarily the result of increased trade spend and promotion allowances during the current quarter, being partially offset by increased Mary Jones sales and increased Food Service revenue as well. 
 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, trade spend and promotion allowances, which reduced the amount of revenue for the sales of our product, totaled approximately 1.5 million, an increase of approximately 941,000, or 174.9 , compared to approximately 538,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to promotional and pricing programs related to our Mary Jones products and core Jones Soda sales in Canada due to a transition to a new distributor. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, gross profit decreased by approximately 586,000, or 39.6 to approximately 894,000 compared to approximately 1.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, gross margin decreased to 21.2 from 32.9 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by increased trade spend and allowances, especially in Canada, combined with increased cost of goods sold in the current quarter compared to the previous quarter mostly as a result of increased warehousing costs. 
 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses 
 
 Selling and marketing expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 1.6 million, an increase of approximately 490,000 or 42.5 compared to approximately 1.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in online marketing spend for both the Jones Soda and Mary Jones brands. Additionally, we increased our marketing initiatives with companies involved with action sports, including a partnership with Thrill One Sports Entertainment, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that did not occur in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 39.0 in the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 25.7 in the same period in 2023. We intend to continue to balance selling and marketing expenses with our working capital resources. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, non-cash expenses included in selling and marketing expenses (stock compensation and depreciation) were approximately 37,000 and 13,000), respectively. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 1.9 million, an increase of approximately 597,000, or 47.0 , compared to approximately 1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily a result of increased legal expenditures related to our Mary Jones business, in addition to increased travel expenditures in connection with the Company s growth plan that includes new supply chain and sponsorship partners. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 44.3 in the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 28.2 in the same quarter in 2023. We intend to continue to carefully manage general and administrative expenses with our working capital resources. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, non-cash expenses included in general and administrative expenses (stock compensation and depreciation) were approximately 345,000 and 96,000, respectively. The increase in non-cash expenses included in general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the restricted stock units granted to members of the Company s Board of Directors in the second quarter of 2024 resulting in a higher expense in the third quarter of 2024 than the expense associated with the stock options granted to members of the Company s Board of Directors in 2023. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 We incurred 10,000 in interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to no interest expenses in the third quarter of 2023, due to the line of credit balance that was outstanding in July 2024 prior to paying off the entire outstanding balance so that as of September 30, 2024 we had no outstanding amounts under our line of credit. 

20

Table of Contents 

Income Tax Expense 
 
 We incurred approximately 5,000 and 8,000 of income tax expense during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to the tax provision on income from our Canadian operations. We have not recorded any tax benefit for the loss in our U.S. operations as we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets. We expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets until we sustain an appropriate level of taxable income through improved U.S. operations. Our effective tax rate is based on recurring factors, including the forecasted mix of income before taxes in various jurisdictions, estimated permanent differences and the recording of a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets. 
 
 Net loss 
 
 Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2.6 million compared to net loss of approximately 934,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This increase in net loss was primarily due to the increased sales and marketing and general and administrative costs associated with the development of new products and other operating expenses to support Company's growth plans, in addition to the decrease in gross profit. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenue 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales revenue increased by approximately 3.2 million, or 24.2 , to approximately 16.4 million compared to approximately 13.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in sales revenue was primarily the result of an increase in sales volume of the Mary Jones branded products, an increase in our Nuka Cola sales online, and an increase in revenue related to core Jones Soda sales in Canada, being partially offset by increased trade spend and promotional allowances. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, trade spend and promotion allowances, which reduced the amount of revenue for the sales of our product, totaled approximately 3.1 million, an increase of approximately 1.8 million, or 148.9 , compared to approximately 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to promotional and pricing programs related to Mary Jones products and core Jones Soda sales in Canada due to a transition to a new distributor. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit increased by approximately 1.2 million, or 28.1 , to approximately 5.3 million compared to approximately 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross margin increased to 32.7 from 31.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by proactive pricing adjustments, supply chain optimization, and increased sales of our Mary Jones branded products which generally have higher margins than our other products, being partially offset by increased trade spend and allowances, especially in Canada, as well as increased cost of goods sold in the current period compared to the same period last year mostly as a result of increased warehousing costs. 
 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses 
 
 Selling and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 1.8 million to 5.1 million in comparison to approximately 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in online marketing spend for both the Jones Soda and Mary Jones brands. Additionally, we increased our marketing initiatives with companies involved with action sports, including a partnership with Thrill One Sports Entertainment, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that did not occur in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 30.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 24.8 in the same period in 2023. We intend to continue to balance selling and marketing expenses with our working capital resources. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, non-cash expenses included in selling and marketing expenses (stock compensation and depreciation) were approximately 101,000 and 42,000, respectively. 

21

General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 5.6 million, an increase of approximately 1.4 million, or 33.1 , compared to approximately 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily a result of increased legal expenditures related to our Mary Jones business, in addition to increased travel expenditures in connection with the Company s growth plan that includes new supply chain and sponsorship partners. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 34.4 in the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 from 32.1 in the same period in 2023. We will continue to carefully manage general and administrative expenses with our working capital resources. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, non-cash expenses included in general and administrative expenses (stock compensation and depreciation) were approximately 927,000 and 611,000, respectively. The increase in non-cash expenses included in general and administrative expenses in 2024 was primarily due to restricted stock units granted to members of the Company s Board of Directors in 2024 which were not granted in 2023, being partially offset by fewer stock options granted to officers and directors in this period compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Interest Expense 
 
 We incurred 17,000 in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to our current line of credit, compared to no interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 We incurred approximately 26,000 and 30,000 of income tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to the tax provision on income from our Canadian operations. We have not recorded any tax benefit for the loss in our U.S. operations as we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets. We expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets until we sustain an appropriate level of taxable income through improved U.S. operations. Our effective tax rate is based on recurring factors, including the forecasted mix of income before taxes in various jurisdictions, estimated permanent differences and the recording of a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets. 
 
 Net loss 
 
 Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 5.3 million compared to net loss of approximately 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in net loss was primarily due to the increased sales and marketing and general and administrative costs associated with the development of new products and other operating expenses to support the Company's growth plans.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 2.7 million and 3.9 million, respectively, and working capital of approximately 6.6 million and 7.2 million, respectively. Net cash used in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled approximately 4.4 million and 2.1 million, respectively. We incurred a net loss of approximately 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of approximately 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our accumulated deficit increased to 88.4 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to an accumulated deficit of 83.1 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately 3.3 million, most significantly due to the proceeds from our issuance of common stock from the Private Placement (as defined below) described in Note 3 in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities totaled 603,000 due to repayments on our insurance financing agreement. 
 
 We have experienced recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities. These factors initially raised substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. On May 17, 2024, the Company signed a financing agreement from a creditor to provide the Company with a 2 million revolving credit facility for working capital needs (See Note 7 in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements, for additional information). Additionally, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company closed a private placement equity raise for net proceeds of 3.7 million, after deducting placement agency fees and other offering expenses (the Private Placement (See Note 3 in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements, for additional information). 
 
 Based on management's current operating plan, the Company believes its cash and cash equivalents on hand, projected cash generated from product sales, proceeds from Private Placement, and funds available from the revolving credit facility are sufficient to fund the Company's operations for a period of at least 12 months subsequent to the issuance of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and alleviates the conditions that initially raised substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received 37,000 and nil, respectively from the cash exercise of stock options. From time to time, we may receive additional cash through the exercise of stock options or stock warrants. However, we cannot predict the timing or amount of cash proceeds we may receive from the exercise, if at all, of any of the outstanding stock options or warrants.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

(a) 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

(b) 
 Changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

There were no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On March 25, 2024, our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Mary Jones Michigan LLC ("MJM"), received a Notice of Claims for arbitration (the Core Claim from Core for an arbitration proceeding to be held in Columbus Ohio, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The Core Claim alleges that MJM breached the terms of the agreement entered into between MJM and Core on August 24, 2023 (the Core Agreement ). The Core Agreement provided that Core was to manufacture a line of Hemp derived Delta-9 THC craft sodas for MJM. Previous to the Core Claim, MJM sent a Notice of Material Breaches by Core Manufacturing and Demand for Audit dated February 1, 2024, which claimed that Core was in breach of its commitments under the Core Agreement. In the Core Claim, Core is seeking to enforce the break-up fee provision in the Core Agreement (which Core calculates to be 7,220,357), as well as obtain other damages arising from MJM s alleged failure to comply with the Core Agreement. We dispute the allegations of Core in the Core Claim and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. On April 16, 2024, MJM filed an Answer to the Core Claim asserting multiple affirmative defenses to the two breach of contract claims and asserted in its own Counterclaim causes of action against Core for breach of contract, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation. The arbitration is in its early stages but an arbitrator has been selected. 
 
 MJM is also seeking from P3 Capital Partner LLC P3 ), an entity related to Core, the return of a 155,700 deposit previous paid to P3 in connection with the license and manufacturing agreement between MJM and P3. MJM filed for litigation in Michigan federal court asserting claims for fraud, conversion, and breach of contract against P3. 
 
 Other than the above, we are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings. We may be involved from time to time in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings involving employee claims, contract disputes, product liability and other general liability claims, as well as trademark, copyright, and related claims and legal actions.
