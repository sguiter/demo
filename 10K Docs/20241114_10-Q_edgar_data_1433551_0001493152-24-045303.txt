shares of common stock of SGLA and shares of preferred
stock of SGLA. Immediately after completion of the share exchange, the Company has a total of shares of common stock outstanding
and shares of preferred stock outstanding. 

Prior
to the merger, Luo Xiong and spouse Wo Kuk Ching and their immediate family members controlled of SGLA, and of SGL. Following
the merger, Luo Xiong and spouse Wo Kuk Ching and their immediate family members controlled of SGLA consolidated with SGL. 

As
SGLA and SGL were under common control at the time of the share exchange, the transaction is accounted for as a combination of entities
under common control in a manner similar to the pooling-of-interests method of accounting. In pooling-of-interests accounting, the financial
statements of the previously separate companies for periods before the combination are recast on a combined basis for all prior periods
that the entities are under common control. The accompanying combined financial statements for all periods presented are referred to
as the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company s consolidated financial statements as of September
30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, and for the three-month ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, include SGLA s, SGL s, and Tian Li s
historical assets, liabilities, and results of operations, including the issuance of shares of common stock of SGLA and 
shares of preferred stock of SGLA on October 1, 2023, as if the combination and issuance of shares occurred at the beginning of the earliest
period presented. 

The
Company conducts its business through its subsidiary Tian Li, which operates in Malaysia as an environmental technology company and recycler
of plastic waste bottles and plastic packaging materials. 

,
and used cash in operating activities of .
The Company had an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2024 of ,
and net current liabilities of .
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date
that the financial statements are issued. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, in its audit report to the
financial statements included in the Company s Transition Report on Form 10-KT for the three months transition period ended
June 30, 2024, expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately
to attain profitable operations. Management believes additional cash required to meet the Company s obligations as they become
due will be provided by way of advances from related parties. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be
available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional
financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution
for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

Management
assesses the carrying value of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from
the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment
loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
the Company determined there were no indicators of impairment of its property and equipment.

of Operations 

Revenues
and Cost of Revenues

for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net revenues was mainly due to a decrease in sales of plastic recycle
products from the third parties. 

Cost
of revenues was 657,728 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a decrease of 85,784, or 12 , from 743,512 for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue was due to the unit cost is lower in line with our revenue decrease.

Loss 

Gross
loss was 200,481 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and gross loss was 197,634, for the three months ended September 30,
2023, reflecting a slight increase of 2,847 or 1 . The increase in gross loss was mainly due to the decrease in the net revenues. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses were 106,963 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a decrease of 71,169,
or 40 , from 178,132 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The general and administrative expenses was reduced

Going
concern.

of 333,331 and cash used in operating activities of 228,941. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Sino

issued. In addition, Sino Green Land Corporation s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on Sino
Green Land Corporation s June 30, 2024, audited financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Sino Green Land
Corporation s ability to continue as a going concern. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be
available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain
additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause
substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

Cash
Flow from Operating Activities 

Cash
flow used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 228,941 as compared to the amount of 329,015 used
in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a decrement of 100,074. The decrease in net cash used
in operating activities was mainly due to the fact that the increase from the account payable, accrued assets and other payables and
prepayment impact on cash flows. 

Cash
Flow from Investing Activities 

Cash
flow provided by investing activities was 9,105 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and used in investing activities was 41,671
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash flow provided by investing activities was mainly due to no acquisition
of PPE, and sales of factory equipment. 

Cash
Flow from Financing Activities 

Cash
flow provided by financing activities was 451,200 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 409,827 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was mainly due to the decrease in loan proceeds.

DISCLOSURE
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 

We
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. This evaluation was carried out by Wo Kuk Ching Ms. Wo ),
our Chief Executive Officer and Wong Ching Wing Elise ), our Chief Financial Officer, who also serve as our principal executive
officer and principal financial and accounting officer, respectively. Based upon that evaluation, Ms. Wo and Elise concluded that, as
of SEPTEMBER 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. 

The
material weaknesses identified include (i) the Company did not maintain a functioning independent audit committee and did not maintain
an independent board; (ii) the Company had inadequate segregation of duties; and (iii) the Company had an insufficient number of personnel
with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience and ongoing training in the application of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure
requirements commensurate with the Company s financial reporting requirements. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
