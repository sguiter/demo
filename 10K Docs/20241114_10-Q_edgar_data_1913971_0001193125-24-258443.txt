Loan cash flows were generated on an individual loan basis. The probability of default PD ), loss given default LGD ), exposure of default and prepayment assumptions are the key factors driving credit losses that are embedded in the estimated cash flows. The Company determined that million of the acquired loans were purchased credit deteriorated PCD of which million were performing and million were non-performing
 at the time of the acquisition.

loans totaling million that were individually analyzed for potential credit loss and all the loans have real estate as credit support. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had loans totaling million that were individually analyzed for potential credit loss. 
 Occasionally, the Company will modify the contractual terms of loans to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties as a way to mitigate loss, proactively work with borrowers in financial difficulty, or to comply with regulations regarding the treatment of certain bankruptcy filing and discharge situations. Typically, such concessions may consist of a reduction in interest rate to a below market rate, taking into account the credit quality of the note, extension of additional credit base on receipt of adequate collateral, or a deferment or reduction of payments (principal or interest) which materially alters the Company s position or significantly extends the note s maturity date, such that the present value of cash flows to be received is materially less than those contractually established at the loan s origination. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount forgiven is charged off against the allowance for credit losses on loans. There were modifications to borrowers with financial difficulties and no loans that defaulted for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023.

 There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. The Company s policy is to recognize transfers between levels as of the end of the reporting period. 
 The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair value disclosures: 
 Investment Securities 

 The fair value of securities available-for-sale

 (carried at fair value) and held-to-maturity

 (carried at amortized cost) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. Level 2 debt securities are valued by a third-party pricing service commonly used in the banking industry, and not adjusted by management. Level 2 fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution date, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the security s terms and conditions, among other things. 
 Individual evaluated loans (generally carried at fair value) 

 Individual loans carried at fair value are those loans in which the Company has measured for a reserve and are generally based on the fair value of the related loan s collateral. Fair value is generally determined based upon independent third-party appraisals of the properties, or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds, discounted for estimated selling costs or other factors the Company determines will impact collection of proceeds. These assets are included as Level 3 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.

 The Mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of MSR is obtained through independent third-party valuations. 
 Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).

million of goodwill along with a core deposit intangible asset of million for the Cornerstone Bank acquisition in 2024 and recorded million of goodwill along with a core deposit intangible asset of million for the five branches acquired in 2019. The Noah Bank acquisition that occurred in 2023 did not generate any goodwill, but the Bank recorded thousand in core deposit intangible asset. The core deposit intangible assets are being amortized over years, using the sum of the year s digits. Except as set forth below, GAAP requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually (with the Company s annual evaluation occurring on May 31 of each year) or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The reporting unit was determined to be our community banking operations, which is our only operating segment. 
 ASC Topic 350-20
 guidance requires an annual review of the fair value of a Reporting Unit that has goodwill in order to determine if it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a Reporting Unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. A qualitative factor test can be performed to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If this qualitative test determines it is not more likely than not (less than probability) that the fair value of the Reporting Unit is less than the Carrying Value, then the Company does not have to perform a quantitative test and goodwill can be considered not impaired. The Company performed its annual review at May 31, 2024 and determined that it was more than probable the fair value of the Reporting Unit exceeds the then Carrying Value, therefore a quantitative test was not required as of May 31, 2024.

The most significant factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements include the ongoing impact of higher inflation levels, higher interest rates and general economic and recessionary concerns, all of which could impact economic growth and could cause a reduction in financial transactions and business activities, including decreased deposits and reduced loan originations, our ability to manage liquidity in a rapidly changing and unpredictable market, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and additional interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following factors: difficulties and delays in integrating the businesses of Cornerstone Bank and the Company, retaining Cornerstone s customers or fully realizing cost savings and other benefits; the global impact of the military conflicts in the Ukraine and the Middle East; the impact of any future pandemics or other natural disasters; civil unrest, rioting, acts or threats of terrorism, or actions taken by the local, state and Federal governments in response to such events, which could impact business and economic conditions in our market area; the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which the Company and Bank conduct operations; the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; market and monetary fluctuations; market volatility; the value of the Bank s products and services as perceived by actual and prospective customers, including the features, pricing and quality compared to competitors products and services; the willingness of customers to substitute competitors products and services for the Bank s products and services; credit risk associated with the Bank s lending activities; risks relating to the real estate market and the Bank s real estate collateral; the impact of changes in applicable laws and regulations and requirements arising out of our supervision by banking regulators; other regulatory requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank; and the timing and nature of the regulatory response to any applications filed by the Company and the Bank; technological changes; other acquisitions; changes in consumer spending and saving habits; those risks under the heading Risk Factors set forth in the Bank s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the success of the Company at managing the risks involved in the foregoing. The Company cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company, except as required by applicable law or regulation.

Economy The US economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.8 over the three months ended September 30, 2024, lifted by consumer spending. Inflation has slowed after hitting a 40-year high, but households still grapple with a 20 increase in prices since 2021, an increase in energy prices, higher interest rates (impacting the real estate market) and uncertainties resulting from regional conflicts in around the world, including in Ukraine and the Middle East. U.S. unemployment, at 4.7 , is low but rising. The unemployment rate in New Jersey is 4.6 at September 30, 2024. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 General Total assets were 2.35 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 438.2 million, or 22.87 when compared to 1.92 billion at the end of 2023. The primary reason for the increase in total assets was the acquisition of Cornerstone Bank on August 23, 2024, which had approximately 303.5 million in assets (at fair value) at closing. When looking at specific components of the balance sheet, including acquired assets, the Company recorded an increase in net loans of 283.1 million primarily related to the Cornerstone acquisition, an increase in investments of 97.5 million, an increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately 30.5 million. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents increased 30.5 million, or 20.26 , to 181.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.

Investment securities Total available-for-sale investment securities increased million 97.5, or 106.74 , to 188.9 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. This increase was related to the purchase of mortgage-backed securities of U.S. government sponsored enterprises, and U.S government agency securities along with 14.0 million in securities acquired in the Cornerstone Bank acquisition during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024. Loans Loans, net of deferred loan fees and costs, increased 283.1 million, or 18.28 , to 1.83 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The primary reasons for the increase in net loans were the 255.5 million in loans acquired from Cornerstone Bank and the 26.1 million increase from existing operations. The increase in the Company s net loans consisted of increases of 248.5 million in commercial real estate loans, 42.9 million in commercial and industrial loans, 32.3 million in residential mortgages, and 11.3 in home equity and consumer loans, all partially offset by a decrease of 51.9 million in construction loans.

For the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, charge-offs were 278 thousand and 645 thousand, and recoveries were 172 thousand and 378 thousand. For the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, charge-offs were zero and 1.9 million, and recoveries were 22 thousand and 52 thousand, respectively. The coverage ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period end loans was 1.27 at September 30, 2024 and 1.19 at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, non-performing assets totaled 2.3 million, a decrease of 4.4 million when compared to the amount at December 31, 2023. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, was 0.13 at September 30, 2024 and 0.43 at December 31, 2023. Deposits Total deposits on September 30, 2024, increased 410.3 million, or 25.08 , when compared to December 31, 2023. The primary reasons for the increase in total deposits were the 282.8 million in deposits acquired from Cornerstone Bank and the 127.5 million increase from existing operations. The increase in the Company s deposits consisted of increases in certificates of deposit of 149.0 million, money market deposits of 139.3 million, non-interest-bearing deposits of 53.6 million, interest-bearing demand deposits of 36.6 million and savings deposits of 31.8 million. At September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 616.7 million in uninsured deposits, consisting of 89.0 million in non-interest-bearing demand deposits, 184.9 million in interest-bearing demand deposits, 172.2 million in money market accounts, 27.7 million in savings deposits and 142.9 million in certificates of deposits. Borrowings The Company had no outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. Stockholders equity Total stockholders equity at September 30, 2024, increased 21.3 million or 8.86 when compared to December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the 21.2 million increase in paid-in capital associated with the issuance of common stock of 20.0 million related to the acquisition of Cornerstone and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of 1.6 million. The ratio of equity to total assets at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 was 11.1 and 12.5 , respectively. The current period ratio decrease was primarily due to the Cornerstone Bank acquisition. Liquidity Our liquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal repayments of securities and outstanding loans, and funds provided from operations. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earnings assets such as overnight deposits or U.S. agency securities, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities. As a member of the FHLB we are eligible to borrow funds in an aggregate amount of up to 50 of the Company s total assets, subject to its collateral requirements. Based on available eligible securities and qualified real estate loan collateral, the Company had the ability to borrow an additional 471.8 million as of September 30, 2024. The company maintained a 60.0 million letter of credit with the FHLB supporting municipal deposits as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was eligible to use the Federal Reserve discount window for borrowings. Based on assets pledged as collateral as of the applicable date, the Bank s borrowing availability was approximately 10.0 million at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding advances from the discount window. The Company is also a shareholder of Atlantic Community Bancshares, Inc., the parent company of Atlantic Community Bankers Bank ACBB ). As of September 30, 2024, the Company had available borrowing capacity with ACBB of 10.0 million to provide short-term liquidity generally for a period of not more than fourteen days. No amounts were outstanding under our line of credit with ACBB at September 30, 2024.

We believe that our current sources of funds provide adequate liquidity for our current cash flow needs. Capital Resources Regulatory Capital Requirements . Federally insured, state-chartered non-member banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. Current FDIC capital standards require these institutions to satisfy a common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and a Tier 1 capital requirement, a leverage capital requirement and a risk-based capital requirement. In addition, in order to make capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction, an institution must also maintain additional common equity in excess of the minimum requirements. This excess is referred to as a capital conservation buffer. At September 30, 2024, the required capital conservation buffer is 2.50 . Under the risk-based capital requirements, total capital (a combination of core and supplementary capital) must equal at least 8.0 of risk-weighted assets. The FDIC also is authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis. Management believes, as of September 30, 2024, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and is well capitalized under applicable regulations. The Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios and the regulatory requirements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented below:

 Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General The Company reported net loss of (4.5) million, or 0.68) per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of 7.6 million, or 1.19 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023. The 12.1 million decrease in net income for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to acquisition-related items recorded in the third quarter of 2024 due to the Company s acquisition of Cornerstone Bank. Specifically, the decrease was a result of an increase of 10.0 million in non-interest expense, and an increase in the provision for credit losses of 4.8 million. These increases were primarily the result of the Cornerstone acquisition which resulted in 7.8 million in merger-related expenses and a 3.2 million provision for credit loss associated with the acquired purchased non-credit deteriorated loans.

Interest on taxable available-for-sale securities increased 916 thousand due to a 150 basis point increase in yield and a 65.0 million increase in the average balance of taxable available-for-sale securities. Other interest and dividend income decreased 737 thousand due to a decrease in average balance of 55.1 million offset by an increase in the yield of 5 basis points. Interest expense Interest expense on deposits increased 4.4 million to 14.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, due to increases in both the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits of 68 basis points and in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of 223.5 million over the same prior year period. Provision for credit losses The Company recorded a provision of credit losses of 4.6 million during the three-months ended September 30, 2024, 3.2 million related to the CECL impact for purchased non-credit deteriorated loans associated with loans acquired in the Cornerstone acquisition, and 1.5 million recorded to the allowance of credit losses resulting from quantitative factors changes in the Company s loan portfolio assumptions, offset by an decrease to the provision for credit losses of 88 thousand related to unfunded commitments, which are recorded in other liabilities on the Company s statements of financial condition. Charge-offs were 278 thousand, and recoveries were 172 thousand, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Non-interest income Total non-interest income was 2.1 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 347 thousand or 14.4 when compared to the same prior year period. Non-interest expense Total non-interest expense was 20.1 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 10.0 million or 98.3 when compared to the same prior year period. The increase was due primarily to 7.8 million in merger-related expenses recorded, 379 thousand more in salaries and benefits expense and 214 thousand more in data processing and communications expenses during the three-months ended September 30, 2024, of which were all primarily associated with the Cornerstone Bank acquisition. Provision for income taxes For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of 1.1 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of (20.1 ), compared to an income tax expense of 1.5 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 16.6 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 General The Company reported net income of 5.0 million, or 0.77 per diluted common share, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 20.5 million, or 3.21 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily the result of a 9.7 bargain purchase gain in 2023 from the Company s acquisition of Noah Bank in May of that year, a reduction of 2.6 million of income tax expense and the additional operating expenses recorded in 2024 related to the Cornerstone acquisition. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

Interest income Interest income increased 18.7 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Interest income on loans increased 14.2 million due to increases in both the average balance of loans of 185.1 million and the yield of 47 basis points. Interest on taxable available-for-sale securities increased 1.9 million due to a 158 basis point increase in yield and a 42.2 million increase in the average balance of taxable available-for-sale securities. Other interest and dividend income increased 2.6 million due to an increase in average balance of 59.3 million and an increase in the yield of 16 basis points. Interest expense Interest expense on deposits increased 19.3 million to 40.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, due to increases in both the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits of 126 basis points and in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of 284.6 million over the same prior year period. Provision for credit losses The Company recorded a 4.7 million provision for credit losses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and recorded 2.5 million provision for credit losses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same prior year period, is primarily due to 3.2 million of the provision related to purchased non-credit deteriorated loans acquired in the Cornerstone Bank acquisition and 1.5 million recorded to the allowance of credit losses resulting from changes in the quantitative factors used in the Company s loan portfolio assumptions. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, charge-offs were 646 thousand, and recoveries were 378 thousand. Non-interest income For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income decreased 9.2 million or (60.1 ), from the same nine-month period in 2023, primarily due to the 9.7 million bargain purchase gain from the Noah acquisition recorded in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Non-interest expense For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense was 44.0 million, compared to 37.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in merger-related expenses of 2.2 million during 2024 as well as increases in salaries and employee benefits of 2.2 million over the same period in 2023 associated with merit increases as well as additional staff costs related to the Cornerstone and Noah acquisitions. Provision for income taxes For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Bank recorded an income tax expense of 1.0 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 16.35 , compared to an income tax expense of 3.6 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 14.86 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

How We Manage Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk which is inherent in our lending, investment and deposit gathering activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages interest rate risk exposure. In addition to market risk, our primary risk is credit risk on our loan portfolio. We attempt to manage credit risk through our loan underwriting and oversight policies. The principal objective of our interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk embedded in certain balance sheet accounts, determine the level of risk appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives, and manage the risk consistent with approved guidelines. We seek to manage our exposure to risks from changes in interest rates while at the same time trying to improve our net interest spread. We monitor interest rate risk as such risk relates to our operating strategies. We have established an Asset/Liability Committee which is comprised of both Management and members of the Board of Directors. The Asset/Liability Committee meets on a regular basis and is responsible for reviewing our asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position. Both the extent and direction of shifts in interest rates are uncertainties that could have a negative impact on future earnings. 
 39 

Table of Contents 

Gap Analysis . The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the Company s interest rate sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. During a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income. The table on the next page sets forth the amounts of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at September 30, 2024, which we expect, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown (the GAP Table ). Except as stated below, the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024, based on contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments, and scheduled rate adjustments within a three-month period and subsequent selected time intervals. The loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable-rate loans and fixed-rate loans, and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans.

Table of Contents 

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable-rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. Net Portfolio Value Analysis . Our interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model which generates estimates of the changes in our net portfolio value NPV over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of September 30, 2024, and reflects the changes to NPV as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated.

 Economic Value of Equity (EVE) divded by Economic Value of Assets (EVA) As is the case with the GAP Table, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in NPV require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the NPV model provides an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such model is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.
