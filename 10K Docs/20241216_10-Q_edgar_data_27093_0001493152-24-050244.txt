FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

Some
information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q may contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements
include comments relating to the ability of available cash reserves at October 31, 2024, to be sufficient for greater than the next twelve
months; U.S. Gold Corp. s (the Company, we, us, or our ability to continue
as a going concern; expected vesting of options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock and expected legal and accounting
expenses to maintain compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the effect of these expenses on the Company s profitability
and our results of operations. 

We
use the words anticipate, continue, likely, estimate, expect, may, 
 could, will, project, should, believe and variations of such words
and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Statements that contain these words discuss our future expectations and
plans, or state other forward-looking information. Although we believe the expectations and assumptions reflected in those forward-looking
statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that these expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct. Our actual results
could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in,
or incorporate by reference in this report, including: 

deviations
 from the projections set forth in the prefeasibility study for the CK Gold Project due to unanticipated variations in grade, unexpected
 challenges with potential mining of the deposit, volatility in commodity prices, variations in expected recoveries, increases in
 projected operating or capital costs, or delays in our permitting plans; 

mining
 exploration and development risks, including risks related to regulatory approvals, operational hazards and accidents, equipment
 breakdowns, contractor disputes, contractual disputes related to exploration properties and other unanticipated difficulties; 

the
 strength of the world economies; 

competition
 in the gold and precious minerals mining industries; 

fluctuations
 in interest rates and inflation rates; 

changes
 in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities; 

future
 adverse legislation regarding the mining industry and climate change; 

the
 impact of geopolitical events and other uncertainties, such as the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; 

current
 and future political and economic factors in the United States and China and the relationship between the two countries; 

our
 ability to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market LLC s Nasdaq listing standards; 

volatility
 in the market price of our common stock; 

our
 ability to fund our business with our current cash reserves based on our currently planned activities; 

our
 ability to raise the necessary capital required to continue our business on terms acceptable to us or at all; 

our
 expected cash needs and the availability and plans with respect to future financing; 

our
 ability to maintain the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting; 

adverse
 technological changes and cybersecurity threats; 

our
 ability to retain key management and mining personnel necessary to operate and grow our business successfully; and 

the
 factors discussed under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024 fiscal
 year 2024 ). 

Many
of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking
statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known to us. Consequently,
forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from
the results and outcomes discussed in or anticipated by the forward-looking statements. These statements speak only as of the date of
this Form 10-Q. Except as required by law, we are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements
to reflect future events or developments. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us and persons acting
on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.

ASC
820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 

These
inputs are prioritized below: 

Level
1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

 Level
2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 

 Level
3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own assumptions. 

The
Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under the Financial Accounting Standard Board s FASB accounting standard for such instruments. Under this standard, financial assets and liabilities are classified in
their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The
Company s warrant liability for warrants issued in connection with equity financing in March 2022 and April 2023 (see Note 9) was
estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model using Level 3 inputs. 

. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the Company evaluates, at least annually,
the rating of the financial institutions in which it holds deposits. At October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the Company had bank balances
of approximately million and million, respectively, exceeding the FDIC insurance limit on interest bearing accounts. 

and at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively, consist primarily of
costs paid for future services which will occur within a year. Prepaid expenses principally include prepayments in cash and equity instruments
for consulting, public relations, business advisory services, insurance premiums, mining claim fees, easement fees, options fees, and
mineral lease fees which are being amortized over the terms of their respective agreements.

When
a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized on a units-of-production basis over the proven
and probable reserves following the commencement of production. The Company assesses the carrying costs of the capitalized mineral properties
for impairment under ASC 360-10, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets , and evaluates their carrying value under ASC 930-360,
 Extractive Activities Mining , annually. An impairment is recognized when the sum of the expected undiscounted future
cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral properties. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying
amount of the mineral properties over its estimated fair value. 

To
date, the Company has expensed all exploration and pre-development costs as none of its properties have satisfied the criteria above
for capitalization. 

ASC
930-805, Extractive Activities Mining: Business Combinations ASC 930-805 ), states that mineral rights
consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include
mineral rights. 

Acquired
mineral rights are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value
as of the acquisition date. As a result, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral
rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining claims. 

ASC
930-805 provides that in measuring the fair value of mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both: 

The value beyond proven and probable reserves VBPP to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining
the fair value of the assets. 

The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of
market participants. 

Leases
to explore for or use of natural resources are outside the scope of ASC 842, Leases .

warrants and warrants issued in March 2022 and April 2023 (the Warrant Agreements ),
respectively, in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging whereby under that provision
these warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as a liability (see Note 9). Accordingly, the Company
classifies these warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period.
This liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised or expire, and any change in fair value will
be recognized in the Company s statement of operations. The fair value of these warrants is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation
model. Such warrant classification is also subject to re-evaluation at each reporting period.

The
Company follows the provision of ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions ASC 740-10 ).
When tax returns are filed, there may be uncertainty about the merits of positions taken or the amount of the position that would be
ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements
in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or
aggregated with other positions. 

Tax
positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than
50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with
tax positions taken that exceed the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits
in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon
examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all more likely than not to be upheld upon examination. As such, the Company
has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits or for any related interest and penalties. In the event that the Company is assessed
penalties and/or interest, penalties will be charged to other operating expense and interest will be charged to interest expense. 

The
Company follows ASC 740-10-25, Definition of Settlement , which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether
a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position
can be effectively settled upon the completion and examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions
considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered
more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The
federal and state income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities,
generally for three years after they are filed.

million, working capital of approximately million, which consists primarily of cash, and an accumulated deficit
of approximately million. The Company had a net loss and cash used in operating activities of approximately million and 
million, respectively, for the six months ended October 31, 2024. As a result of the utilization of cash in its operating activities,
and the development of its assets, the Company has incurred losses since it commenced operations. The Company s primary source
of operating funds since inception has been equity financings. As of the filing date of this Form 10-Q, the Company may have sufficient
cash to fund its corporate activities and general and administrative costs and currently undertaken project activities related to permitting
and engineering studies. However, in order to advance any of its projects past the aforementioned objectives the Company does not have
sufficient cash and will need to raise additional funds. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

This volatility input precludes the Company from applying equity accounting as the warrant holder could receive a net cash settlement
value that is greater than a holder of the Company s common stock. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that liability accounting
is required. 

As
such, these warrants are recorded at fair value as of each reporting date with the change in fair value reported within other income
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as Change in fair value of warrant liability until the warrants
are exercised, expired or other facts and circumstances lead the warrant liability to be reclassified to stockholders equity.
The Company utilized a Monte Carlo Simulation model to estimate the fair values of the April 2023 and March 2022 warrants, which incorporates
significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The unobservable
inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the contingent consideration reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions
that market participants would use in valuing the contingent consideration. The Company determined the fair value by using the below
key inputs to the Monte Carlo Simulation Model. 

Measurement 

The
Company accounted for the warrants issued on March 18, 2022 and the warrants issued on April 10, 2023, in accordance
with the guidance contained in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging whereby under that provision these warrants did not meet
the criteria for equity treatment and were recorded as a liability.

 economics for our CK Gold Project which will be incorporated into an updated prefeasibility
 study. 

In
 September 2024, we participated in the Precious Metals Summit Beaver Creek, Denver Gold Forum
 Americas, and Gold Forum Americas 2024 conferences. 

Recent
Developments 

In
November 2024, we announced that our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gold King Corp., received final permit approval from the Air Quality Division

of 4,410,551. 

We
are obligated to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act ). In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley and the rules subsequently
implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have imposed various requirements on public companies, including
requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect to spend between 175,000 and 250,000 in legal and accounting expenses
annually to comply with our reporting obligations and Sarbanes-Oxley. These costs could affect profitability and our results of operations. 

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP
and have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred net losses in the amounts
of approximately 6,428,000 and 3,153,000, respectively. For the six months ended October 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities
was approximately 4,012,000. As of October 31, 2024, we had cash of approximately 1,630,000, working capital of approximately 1,660,000,
and an accumulated deficit of approximately 79,276,000. Our primary source of operating funds since inception has been equity financings.
As of October 31, 2024, we may have sufficient cash to fund our corporate activities and general and administrative costs and currently
undertaken project activities related to permitting and engineering studies over the next twelve months. However, in order to advance
any of our projects past the aforementioned objectives, we do not have sufficient cash and will need to raise additional funds. These
matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these
financial statements. 

Cash
Used in Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities totaled approximately 4,012,000 and 3,859,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. Net cash used in operating activities during the six months ended October 31, 2024, increased primarily due to the (i)
increase in net loss of approximately 3,275,000 as compared to the six months ended October 31, 2023, (ii) increase in non-cash items
of approximately 2,734,000 as compared to the six months ended October 31, 2023, primarily due to the change in fair value of warrant
liability and decrease in stock based compensation and (iii) increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately
 388,000 as compared to the six months ended October 31, 2023, primarily due to changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets
and changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

At
the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of, and with the participation of,
the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e)
of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at
the reasonable assurance level, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

(b)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II: OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may be involved in claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. To our knowledge, there are
no material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject. 

Item
1A. RISK FACTORS . 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include disclosure under this item. 

Item
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

There
were no sales of unregistered securities during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2024, that were not previously reported on a Current
Report on Form 8-K. 

Item
3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES . 

None. 

Item
4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Pursuant
to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and subpart 104 of Regulation S-K, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that
is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose specified information about mine health and safety
in their periodic reports. These reporting requirements are based on the safety and health requirements applicable to mines under the
Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor s
Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA ). During the six months ended October 31, 2024, the Company and its properties
or operations were not subject to regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the
Dodd-Frank Act or subpart 104 of Regulation S-K.
