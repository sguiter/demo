ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited interim
condensed financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical
information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our
actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include,
but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.
All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 

Throughout
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to we, our, us, the Company, or
 MDwerks, refer to MDwerks, Inc. 

Overview 

We
completed two acquisitions in December 2023 as follows: 

On
December 8, 2023, we acquired Two Trees Beverage Co. and its subsidiaries Two Trees ). Two Trees produces a variety of
aged alcoholic beverages using an innovative rapid-aging system. This scalable technology results in all-natural, high-quality products,
efficiently produced, with a reduced environmental impact. Our products are nearly indistinguishable from those that are traditionally
aged. Two Trees created a proprietary process that mirrors and accelerates the natural aging process that occurs when alcohol is aged
in wooden barrels over time. The true art of our craft spirits lives within the balance between the grain selection, local water, and
the full-bodied flavors from our toasted wood chip varieties. Our wood chips are selected to pair with specific grains and toasted to
just the right char, bringing rich flavor profiles to life with a hint of smoke. 

On
December 27, 2023, we acquired the operations of RF Specialties, LLC RFS ). RFS is an innovative company pushing the boundaries
of sustainable Radio Frequency applications. For over 12 years RFS has addressed companies most pressing challenges by implementing
automated Radio Frequency Technology in a sustainable way reducing energy costs and increasing speed to market when compared to traditional
methods. By bringing Radio Frequency applications to market RFS has successfully elevated a wide range of industries including structural
engineering, food beverage, and manufacturing. 

Our
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the operations of these businesses for the full
quarter. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 do not include any results from the acquired
businesses.

30, 2023 consisted of 168,855 of gains on sale of assets, and interest expense of 9,908. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had 62,478 and 115,111 of cash, respectively. We anticipate that our current cash
and cash generated from financing activities will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. As of
September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred operating losses since inception of 1,648,868. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a
working capital deficit of 762,357. 

We
believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next 12 months, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation
of our business plans. The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses.
Management has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as
a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. These
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts
and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. 

5 

We
expect to incur marketing, professional, and administrative expenses as well expenses associated with maintaining our filings with the
Commission. We will require additional funds during this time and will seek to raise the necessary additional capital. If we are unable
to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities, which could harm our business
plans, financial condition and operating results. Additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The Company
intends to continue to fund its business by way of equity or debt financing and advances from related parties. Any inability to raise
capital as needed would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Cash
Flows 

Cash
Used in Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were
 662,693 and 266,815. The increase was attributable to an increase in net loss compared to the prior year as a result of increased operating
expenses associated with the new businesses as described above. 

Cash
Used from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 6,990
and 82,500, respectively, including purchases of equipment of 6,990 and 88,000, respectively, and purchases of intangible assets of
 0 and 19,500, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 202, cash used in investing activities also included proceeds from
the sale of equipment of 100,000, partially offset by payments on loans receivable of 75,000. 

Cash
Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023
was 617,050 and 491,648, respectively. The cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable
to proceeds from subscriptions agreements of 640,000, proceeds from related party notes payable of 120,500, partially offset by repayments
of notes payable of 143,450. The cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable
to proceeds from sale of common stock of 392,349, proceeds from advances of 118,748, partially offset by repayment of advances of 19,449. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements currently contemplated by management or in place that are reasonably likely to have a current or
future effect on the business, financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, result of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures and/or capital resources. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting standards that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe
that there are any other new accounting standards that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or
results of operations. 

6 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based
on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
Our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations
and require management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Net
sales from Two Trees include liquor and related products, less excise taxes and customer programs and incentives. Sales from RFS include
product and services related to sustainable Radio Frequency applications to a wide range of industries including structural engineering,
food beverage, and manufacturing. The Company recognizes revenue by applying the following steps in accordance with ASC Topic 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in
the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract;
and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. 

The
Company recognizes sales when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse directly to wholesale customers (except in the case of a consignment
sale). For consignment sales, which include sales to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, the Company recognizes sales upon the consignee s
shipment to the customer. Postage and handling charges billed to customers are also recognized as sales upon shipment of the related
merchandise. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point, and title passes to the customer at the time and place of shipment or purchase
by customers at a retail location. For consignment sales, title passes to the consignee concurrent with the consignee s shipment
to the customer. The customer has no cancellation privileges after shipment or upon purchase at retail locations, other than customary
rights of return. For service revenue within the Company s radio frequency applications, the Company recognizes revenue as the
services are provided to the customer over the length of the contract. The Company s contracts typically have a single performance
obligation, and do not contain a significant financing component. 

Goodwill
 - Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill
is not amortized and is subject to annual impairment testing on or between annual tests if an event or change in circumstance occurs
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. In testing for goodwill impairment,
the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to
a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing
the totality of events and circumstances, the Company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount, it can conclude the assessment. If the Company concludes otherwise, the Company is required to
perform a quantitative analysis to determine the amount of impairment. A quantitative analysis is performed at the reporting unit level
by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value to determine the amount of impairment, if
any. The Company has determined that it has one reporting unit. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets - Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying
amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair market value of the
assets.
