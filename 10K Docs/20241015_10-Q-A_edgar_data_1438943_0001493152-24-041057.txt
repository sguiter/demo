Depreciation expense 

The
Company provides for depreciation of its buildings, property and equipment using the straight-line method for both financial reporting
and federal income tax purposes over the estimated six -year useful lives of the assets. 

The
Company assesses the recoverability of its property and equipment by determining whether the depreciation of the assets over their remaining
lives can be recovered through projected future cash flows generated by the assets. There were no assets identified for impairment. 

The
fair value of the Company s stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, which uses certain
assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options or restricted stock, and future
dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model and based
on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation expense
recorded in future periods.

operating business segments: (i) Range Reclaim; (ii) Range Minerals; (iii) Range Water; (iv) Range
Security; (v) Range Land; and (vi) Graphium Biosciences. Previously, beginning in October 2021, the Company began operating under two
segments: (A) the Drug Development segment, which reports the operating results of the Company s broad portfolio of glycosylated
cannabinoid prodrugs operating under the name Graphium Biosciences, and (B) the Range Reclaim segment, which provides land reclamation,
water restoration and incidental coal mining to customers throughout Appalachia. The Range Water, Range Security and Range Land business
segments began operations in 2023. Beginning in January 2024, Range Minerals, which was previously reported within the Range Reclaim
operating business segment, was separately reported as its own operating business segment focused on coal mining, using subcontractors,
and related reclamation activities, and the Drug Development segment was renamed Graphium Biosciences. 

In
accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC 280, the Company s chief operating decision-maker has been
identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance
for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to
report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers,
and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation
under Segment Reporting due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products
and services; and procurement, manufacturing, and distribution processes. 

The First Promissory Note is secured by
the acquired real property and quarry infrastructure, and the Second Promissory Note is secured by the acquired equipment. 

The
Company accounted for the transaction as a business combination in accordance ASC 805 Business Combinations . The Company
has performed an allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The fair values of the assets
acquired are set forth below. Because the fair values exceeded the purchase price, a gain on the purchase of was recognized.
The allocation of the purchase price is based on management s estimates and a third-party assessment of the fair value of the equipment
purchased.

Impact
Investing Strategy 

Our
impact investing strategy aims to improve the health and wellness of people and the planet, while also generating long-term sustainable
financial returns for our shareholders. We believe that doing well and doing good are not mutually exclusive, and that an impact investing
strategy can balance the environmental, social and economic needs of people and the planet while also generating attractive risk-adjusted
financial returns for shareholders. 

Our
impact investing strategy provides an opportunity for our dedicated team to address pressing environmental, social and economic challenges,
such as air and water pollution, educational inequality and economic disparity, and climate change, through the development of technology-based
solutions. By actively directing investment capital towards businesses that are working to create positive environmental, social and
economic outcomes, we believe that our impact investing strategy can contribute to an improved people-planet ecosystem and a healthier
and happier way of life. 

We
have a particular interest in providing environmental and social solutions in economically-disadvantaged regions of the United States.
Initially, the Company is targeting the Appalachian region, which is home to communities with some of the most disadvantaged income,
education and employment demographics in the United States. Our ambitious strategy is to allocate investment capital and build operating
businesses that provide positive environmental and social impact in the disadvantaged coal communities of Appalachia to maximize the
good we can do for people and the planet. 

Operating
Business Segments 

Our
six operating business segments are: (i) Range Reclaim; (ii) Range Minerals; (iii) Range Water; (iv) Range Security; (v) Range Land;
and (vi) Graphium Biosciences. 

Range
Reclaim 

In
May 2022, the Company acquired Range Environmental Resources, Inc., a West Virginia corporation Range Environmental ).
Range Environmental provides land reclamation and water restoration services to customers throughout the Appalachian region with the
goal of returning land to pre-mining conditions or repurposing the land for natural, commercial, agricultural or recreational use. Range
Environmental s water restoration services seek to improve the water quality of rivers, streams and discharges through novel and
innovative treatment applications to help customers meet their various regulatory standards and requirements. 

According
to the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA ), the United States had 551 coal mines in 2020, comprised of 370 active
mines, 141 idled or closed mines, and 40 new or activated mines. Approximately 82 of those coal mines were located in Appalachia (which
comprises the Appalachian Mountains and is commonly known as the cultural region in the Eastern United States stretching from the southern
part of New York to the northern parts of Alabama and Georgia). According to the EIA, there were approximately three times as many coal
mines in the United States in 2008 compared to 2020 with approximately 89 located in Appalachia. The precipitous decline in the number
of operating coal mines since 2008 is due to various supply, demand and regulatory factors, including a reduction in demand for coal
as a source of electricity due to the increased use of natural gas and renewable energy, an increase in coal production costs due to
inflation, the dearth of cost-effective locations remaining for mining, and a more stringent and costly regulatory environment, all of
which have resulted in an increasingly difficult market for coal producers. 

In
2000, coal was responsible for 1,966 billion kWh of electricity generation, which represented 52 of the total electricity generation
in the United States. By contrast, in 2022, coal was responsible for only 828 billion kWh of electricity generation, which represented
20 of the total electricity generation in the United States. According to the EIA, 23 of the 200,568 megawatts of coal-fired capacity
currently operating in the United States is scheduled to be retired by the end of 2029 due to the high cost of operations, continued
competition from natural gas and renewable energy resources, and sustainable initiatives of energy producers. 

However,
the reclamation of closed and inactive mine sites has not kept pace with the increase in closed and idled mine sites, thus creating a
substantial backlog of reclamation work that needs to be completed on former mine sites. According to the U.S. Office of Surfacing Mining
Reclamation and Enforcement OSMRE ), there are approximately 50,000 high-priority abandoned mine land locations in the
United States resulting from legacy coal mining operations that failed to adequately reclaim the land and waterways back to their natural
state. Additionally, there are tens of thousands of active mine sites in the United States that require contemporaneous reclamation of
land and waterways during the active mining process, and an estimated equally large number of idled mine locations that also require
significant land reclamation and water restoration services. 

19 

Under
the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 SMRCA ), OSMRE was established for two basic purposes: (i) to ensure
coal mines in the United States operate in a manner that protects citizens and the environment during mining operations and to restore
the land to beneficial use following mining; and (ii) to implement an Abandoned Mine Land AML reclamation program to
address the hazards and environmental degradation resulting from two centuries of coal mining activities that occurred before SMRCA was
passed in 1977. The AML reclamation program is funded through fees levied against coal producers based on tons of coal produced. As of
September 2020, the AML reclamation fund had collected a total of 11.7 billion in coal mining fees over the life of the program, with
 9.5 billion (81 appropriated and distributed in accordance with SMCRA, and 2.2 billion (19 unappropriated and available for future
disbursement. In November 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, authorized 11.3 billion
in new funding to be appropriated for deposit into the AML reclamation fund. Importantly, the AML reclamation fund is only available
to help fund the reclamation of mines abandoned before SMCRA was enacted in 1977; therefore, all mines abandoned after the year 1977
cannot access funding from the AML reclamation fund and must obtain funding from other sources. 

While
much of the funding for this reclamation work comes from the federal government, each state in Appalachia has a Department of Environmental
Protection or an equivalent agency DEP that oversees coal mining permitting, operations, and reclamation. Under DEP rules
and regulations, coal mining companies are required to develop a mining and reclamation plan that is approved by the applicable state
agency, obtain a mining permit from the state, and secure a reclamation surety bond from a qualified third-party insurance company or
provide a comparable financial guarantee. The reclamation surety bond provides the state with financial assurances that land reclamation
and waterway restoration will be performed in accordance with the original reclamation plan once mining is complete if the coal mining
company, as primary obligor, fails to perform. Therefore, there are at least three groups who may need land reclamation, water restoration
and environmental auditing services: (i) mining companies when permits are active and reclamation bonds are not in default; (ii) surety
bond insurers when reclamation bonds are in default; and (iii) states through their AML reclamation funds for mine lands abandoned before
1977 and for mine lands with defaulted coal mining companies and surety bond insurers after 1977. 

Range
Environmental is planning for continued growth in its land reclamation, water restoration and consulting businesses by expanding its
market share with existing coal mining customers and reclamation bond insurers, adding new coal mining and non-coal mining customers,
and collaborating with the Company s other operating businesses to generate incremental sales opportunities. We will seek to add
additional people, equipment and technologies to support our ambitious growth goals to ensure we successfully execute our value creation
plans for the Company and our shareholders. 

In
August 2023, the Company acquired Collins Building Contracting, Inc. Collins Building ), a West Virginia-based environmental
services business focused on performing reclamation services on abandoned mine lands throughout West Virginia. Collins Building, along
with Range Environmental, are classified within the Range Reclaim operating business segment. 

Range
Minerals 

In
May 2022, the Company acquired Range Natural Resources, Inc., a West Virginia corporation Range Natural ). During the
six months ended June 30, 2024, Range Natural had no mining employees or equipment and engaged an independent, third-party contractor responsible for all aspects
of providing coal mining and reclamation services
on a surface coal mine at the Fola Mine Complex in Fola, West Virginia Fola Mine ). In
January 2024, the Company separated Range Natural s results from the Range Reclaim reporting segment and has
included Range Natural s results in a new Range Minerals reporting segment. The Company believes reporting the
results of Range Minerals separately from Range Reclaim will provide better insight and transparency into the overall operational
performance of both operating business segments. On June 30, 2024, Range Natural terminated its agreement with the independent, third-party contractor that performed
coal mining and reclamation services at the Fola Mine due to a failure to perform. 

Range
Water 

Terra
Preta, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company Terra Preta ), is a biochar product development and environmental solutions
business started by the Company in December 2022. Terra Preta is developing a novel and innovative combination of biochar, proprietary
materials and structural designs intended to create several first-of-its-kind agricultural and water filtration products and solutions. 

20 

Biochar
is a solid, lightweight carbon-rich material produced by the thermal decomposition of organic material (such as cellulosic feedstock,
including wood and plants) using a chemical-conversion process known as pyrolysis. Carbonization pyrolysis is a chemical degradation
process that heats organic materials to produce carbon-rich biochar, liquid bio-oils, and syngas products. Since organic material is
thermally decomposed without oxygen during the pyrolysis process, combustion does not occur, so the process allows for the permanent
capture of carbon in the biochar end-product and eliminates the release of climate-damaging carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The specific
yield of biochar during the carbonization pyrolysis process depends on several variables such as temperature, heating time and heating
rate. Lower temperatures, longer heating times and lower heating rates typically yield more biochar and less bio-oil and syngas. 

Terra
Preta has been launched to build a full-cycle, carbon-negative business that reduces greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, passively
filters contaminated water without the use of harsh chemicals, and provides a fortified, nutrient-rich soil amendment to improve the
growth of agricultural products. 

Greenhouse
gases, comprised of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases, are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, and are
generally believed to result in warmer temperatures and climate change, including changing weather patterns, rising sea levels, and more
extreme weather events. Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through, among other things, the burning of fossil fuels, solid waste and
other biomass materials, and is removed from the atmosphere when absorbed by plants during the photosynthesis process. Terra Preta is
in discussions with a large affiliated landowner to enter into a long-term lease or purchase of at least 100 acres of former mine land
in West Virginia for the planting, growth and harvesting of crops to serve as the primary feedstock for our biochar production operations.
The newly planted crops would then act as a carbon sink , drawing substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
into the plants through the photosynthesis process. When the plants are harvested, biochar is produced through the carbonization pyrolysis
process and the captured carbon dioxide is permanently preserved as carbon in the biochar product for use in water treatment and agricultural
end uses. 

Pursuant
to rules adopted under the Clean Water Act of 1972 Clean Water Act ), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA has implemented various pollution control programs such as wastewater standards for industry and recommendations for pollutants in surface
waters. The Clean Water Act prohibits any party from discharging pollutants into a water of the United States unless they have a permit
issued under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System NPDES ), which contains limits on what a party can discharge
and establishes monitoring and reporting requirements. On mining sites, coal operators are required to sample and test their water discharges
on a regular basis to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act and applicable NPDES permits. Currently, most mining operators treat
non-compliant water with temporary holding ponds and expensive chemicals such as pH adjusters, coagulants and flocculants that require
constant reapplication to ensure compliance. Terra Preta will focus on developing a proprietary, biochar-based passive treatment system
that treats non-compliant mine site discharges to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act and NPDES permits without the need for holding
ponds or expensive chemicals. 

Sustainable
agriculture plays a critical role in the stability, growth, and diversification of our future food supply chain and the growth of plants
intended to serve as a carbon sink to reduce greenhouse gases. High-quality soil, a key condition for sustainable agriculture, requires
organic matter, microorganisms, nutrients, and optimal compaction. Subsoils with a sufficient number of air-filled pores have little
restriction to drainage and aeration, and typically are able to decompose and cycle organic matter and nutrients more efficiently. Alternatively,
soil with poor aeration leads to the build-up of carbon dioxide, reduces the ability of plants to absorb water and nutrients, and leads
to increased plant stress and root disease. To help address the ill effects of soil compaction, Terra Preta is developing a proprietary,
fortified biochar soil amendment that provides unique soil structuring characteristics that will allow plants to grow strong roots that
optimize the absorption of water and nutrients, thereby reducing root stress and disease. 

21 

In
December 2022, Terra Preta filed trademarks for biochar goods and services related to agricultural and water treatment applications.
In March 2023, Terra Preta filed provisional patents related to novel and innovative agricultural and water treatment solutions and designs.
Additionally, in March 2023, Terra Preta purchased two pyrolysis ovens with the capacity to produce one ton of biochar per day to advance
our research and development activities. We are currently evaluating the purchase of a large continuous-process pyrolysis oven to increase
the scale of our biochar production to commercial levels. 

Range
Security 

Range
Security Resources, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company Range Security ), is an environmental security services business
started by the Company in November 2022. Range Security is focused on providing eco-friendly, technology-driven security services to
active and former mine sites, with a particular focus on locations transitioning from coal mining to next generation industries and uses.
Range Security is intended to serve as a complementary business to the Range Reclaim and Range Minerals entities. 

Mine
sites in the Appalachian region frequently comprise thousands of acres of natural habitat with valuable infrastructure and operating
assets disbursed across large tracts of land. However, many of these mine sites lack adequate broadband access or cellular service, and
therefore traditional technology-based security solutions are not available. Also, due to the large land areas and often challenging
access roads and mountainous terrain, consistent visual confirmation of the safety and security of high value assets is problematic,
and unnecessary amounts of carbon dioxide are emitted from heavy-duty trucks used to perform frequent visual security checks. Furthermore,
due to the remoteness and lack of technological options, most security services in the market fail to provide an independent verification
of the security status of a mine site and confirmation of visual security checks, resulting in a customer s uncertainty regarding
the actual security services being provided. 

Valuable
assets commonly found on mine sites requiring high-levels of security services include office buildings, coal operation facilities such
as preparation plants and loadout facilities, power stations and electrical lines, vehicles and heavy equipment, supplies and chemicals,
and spare parts and components. These high-value assets are frequently the target of theft since all or parts of these assets can be
easily removed from the mine site and sold for cash. Unfortunately, the actual damage to the operation resulting from this type of destructive
theft is frequently many times the market value of the stolen item, primarily due to the losses resulting from the down-time of operations,
the cost of repairs and replacement components, and the long-term damage to critical infrastructure that can be repurposed and used to
attract next generation industries once the mining is complete. 

In
March 2023, Range Security was engaged by its first customer for environmental security services covering a 13,000-acre coal mine site
in West Virginia. As of August 13, 2024, Range Security employed 7 security professionals, and is focusing its recruitment efforts on
military veterans, police officers, and other professionals with security experience. Range Security has purchased two fuel-efficient
utility task vehicles for ground surveillance and a thermal-imaging drone for aerial surveillance, all of which use significantly less
fuel and electricity to operate than traditional security vehicles and provide a much broader coverage range with a substantially lower
carbon footprint. Range Security is also in the process of establishing satellite-based wireless service to support video surveillance
and enable a mobile technology solution used by our security professionals to provide real-time evidence of visual security checks. Range
Security plans to expand its security service business to additional mine sites, with a particular focus on locations with valuable infrastructure
being repurposed into non-coal multi-use complexes with attractive job growth prospects and next generation industry opportunities. 

Range
Land 

Range
Land, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company Range Land ), is a land acquisition company started by the Company in August
2023. Range Land is focused on acquiring former mine lands with the goal of reclaiming and repurposing the sites for non-fossil fuel
uses, including commercial, industrial, residential and recreational developments. Range Land is specifically focused on acquiring land
to be used for renewable energy facilities, innovative agricultural installations, and projects focused on improving the quality and
condition of our air, land and waterways. 

According
to industry estimates, Appalachia contains nearly one million acres of abandoned, idled and non-performing mine sites that are burdened
with significant land reclamation and water restoration obligations. Many of these troubled mine sites are subject to mining permits
and associated reclamation bonds, which as a result, prevents the land from being repurposed for non-mining uses until the land has been
reclaimed and the permits and bonds have been released by the applicable state s environmental protection department. Water quality
is a particularly challenging issue since a permit can only be released if the site has at least 12-months of compliant water samples
without active chemical treatment, which heightens the need for water restoration solutions to help transition former mine land to economically
viable non-mining uses. 

The
Company has assembled the internal resources and capabilities to reclaim land, restore waterways, install innovative water treatment
solutions, and secure the mine site to protect the significant historical investment in infrastructure. In addition, the Company has
extensive knowledge and expertise regarding the permit and bond release process, which is a critical step necessary to unlock the underlying
value of the former mine land for non-fossil fuel uses. Range Land is actively reviewing several mine sites throughout Appalachia to
acquire, reclaim and repurpose in order to improve the land and create non-fossil fuel economic development opportunities for disadvantaged
local coal communities. 

In
September 2023, Range Land, through its wholly-owned subsidiary CLV Azurite Land, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company CLV
Azurite ), acquired over 1,900 acres of surface interest at an idled mine complex in West Virginia. CLV Azurite is in active discussions
with the holder of the permits and bonds associated with the acquired land to ensure that the acquired surface acreage can be repurposed
for alternative non-fossil fuel uses. Concurrently, CLV Azurite is in active discussions with two experienced and well-capitalized solar
developers to convert the former mine land into a large solar energy facility on a majority of the acquired surface acreage, as well
as additional acreage for commercial, industrial, recreational and residential development. Under the solar arrangements, CLV Azurite
would be the landlord and the solar developer-operator would be the tenant required to pay CLV Azurite a negotiated lease payment on
a per acre basis. 

Graphium
Biosciences 

Graphium
Biosciences, Inc., a Nevada corporation Graphium ), is a cannabinoid-based drug development company tracing its history
of technological innovation and drug advancement back to October 2011 through two predecessor entities, Stevia First Corp. and Vitality
Biopharma, Inc. In October 2021, the Company formed Graphium as a wholly-owned subsidiary and transferred all of its drug development
assets to this newly-formed entity. 

Graphium
is advancing a broad portfolio of glycosylated cannabinoid prodrugs that have been developed to unlock the rebalancing effects of the
endocannabinoid system to address numerous chronic conditions with inadequate pharmaceutical options. Graphium s leading drug candidate,
VBX-100, is a glycosylated tetrahydrocannabinol THC cannabinoid that targets inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal
tract but without unwanted psychoactive or intoxicating side effects. 

22 

Cannabinoids,
including THC and cannabidiol CBD ), have well-known therapeutic benefits through their interaction with the human endocannabinoid
system, which serves a regulating and rebalancing function in the body. For decades, patients have used cannabinoids to activate the
endocannabinoid system to provide relief for numerous chronic and debilitating ailments, including inflammation, pain, anxiety, depression,
and cancer. However, THC, a commonly-used cannabinoid with significant therapeutic benefit, is psychoactive and intoxicating, and therefore
its use has many practical, and in some cases legal, limitations. Nevertheless, many patients with chronic health conditions, including
gastrointestinal inflammation, continue to use cannabinoids because current pharmaceutical offerings do not provide adequate therapeutic
relief or result in unwanted side effects. 

Our
novel scientific discovery was the development of a proprietary enzymatic bioprocessing technology that adds one or more glucose molecules
to a cannabinoid, resulting in our proprietary glycosylated cannabinoid compounds. Our glycosylated cannabinoids act as prodrugs that
achieve targeted delivery of the bioactive cannabinoids within the body once they are activated. Prodrugs are compounds that, after administration,
are metabolized into a pharmacologically active drug and are often designed to improve drug properties and reduce known or expected toxicities
and adverse side effects. The advantages of our glycosylated cannabinoid prodrugs may include: (i) administration in a convenient oral
formulation; (ii) targeted delivery with release in the colon or large intestine; (iii) improved stability with limited degradation or
drug metabolism; and (iv) delayed release enabling longer-lasting effects and fewer administrations by patients. 

We
have learned through our animal studies that glucose bound to cannabinoid molecules are inactive and poorly absorbed from the intestines,
allowing the combined molecule to reach the large intestine where glycoside hydrolase enzymes cleave the glucose and the cannabinoid
is released in a targeted and restricted manner. Further, we have learned through our animal studies that a targeted release of THC,
which could be provided in very low doses to achieve physiologically beneficial results, serves as an anti-inflammatory agent in the
lower gastrointestinal tract and minimizes the amount of THC absorbed into the blood stream. Therefore, we anticipate our glycosylated
cannabinoid prodrug will provide the anti-inflammatory benefits of low-dose THC while avoiding the psychoactive and intoxicating properties
that hinder the broader pharmaceutical use of THC. Initially, we are targeting the 20 billion inflammatory bowel disease IBD market in the United States, which is composed of patients suffering from ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease, both chronic
and debilitating conditions with no cure. We also believe our glycosylated cannabinoids could also be used to treat other indications,
including, among others, irritable bowel syndrome IBS ), anxiety, depression, autism and cancer. 

By
using our proprietary enzymatic bioprocessing technologies, our research team has developed a novel family of over 100 glycosylated cannabinoid
prodrugs. These glycosylated cannabinoids have unique commercial applications and patentable compositions of matter, which are separate
and distinct from ordinary cannabinoids. Currently, our intellectual property is comprised of the following patents: (i) the Cannabinoid
Glycoside Prodrugs and Methods of Synthesis patent filed in 2016 and granted in 2021 for the invention of novel glycosylated cannabinoids
and methods of targeted delivery for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, including IBD and IBS; (ii) the Antimicrobial Compositions
Comprising Cannabinoids and Methods of Using the Same patent filed in 2018 and granted in 2021 for the use of cannabinoids as antibiotics
for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile ; (iii) the Novel Cannabinoid Glycosides and Uses Thereof patent filed in
2020 and in prosecution for additional novel cannabinoid glycosides and includes research data supporting the improved characteristics
and commercial production strategies for these new molecules; and (iv) the Continuous Enzymatic Perfusion Reactor System patent
filed in 2021 and in prosecution for our improved reactor system for the efficient enzymatic glycosylation of hydrophobic small molecules,
including cannabinoids. We believe our intellectual property portfolio of glycosylated cannabinoids possess significant value and, as
a result, we have allocated substantial resources to ensure that our U.S. and international patents are properly filed and successfully
prosecuted. As our research efforts involving glycosylated cannabinoids continue to progress, we plan to file additional patents to further
expand our growing family of intellectual property assets and create long-term value for our shareholders. 

Our
research team has performed 23 animal studies to test the safety, efficacy and dosing levels of our glycosylated cannabinoids, which
have provided us with favorable scientific data and the opportunity to further refine our drug development plan. We have performed two
industry standard colitis disease mouse models: (i) TNBS model in 2017 and 2018 that generated favorable colitis prevention data; and
(ii) DSS model in 2021 that generated favorable colitis treatment data. In 2021, we received a letter from the Food and Drug Administration s FDA Office of Orphan Products Development stating that we have been granted Orphan Drug Designation for our glycosylated
cannabinoid VBX-100 for the treatment of pediatric ulcerative colitis. An Orphan Drug Designation provides several benefits, including
fee waivers, tax credits, fast tracking of regulatory processes, and seven years of market exclusivity. 

23 

Due
to our development of pharmaceutical products, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local
agencies. Also, since we are researching and developing cannabinoid-based products, we are subject to regulation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration DEA ). Our research and development activities focus on cannabinoids, particularly THC and CBD derived from
the cannabis plant, which the DEA has classified as Schedule I substances. Schedule I substances are defined as drugs with no currently
accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. In May 2019, the DEA informed us that it had determined that they consider our VBX-100
prodrug a Schedule I substance. As a result, any developing, testing, manufacturing, or clinical studies involving our VBX-100 prodrug,
and by inference potentially all of our THC-glycoside molecules, are required to be properly licensed by the DEA and adhere to strict
diversion control standards. 

We
are working closely with a third-party contract research organization to develop a detailed drug development plan to advance our leading
drug candidate, VBX-100, through Phase II clinical trials by the end of 2027, subject to receipt of sufficient funding, which is currently
estimated to be approximately 20 million. Graphium has engaged a registered broker-dealer to assist with the capital raise, which remains in process. 

Competition 

Our
Company is focused on a large and growing marketplace for impact investing initiatives, and therefore, is anticipated to face competition
from a variety of operating businesses and investment funds who are developing similar business plans and operating strategies to satisfy
the increasing demands of these types of investments in the marketplace. In many cases, these competitors are larger and better capitalized
operating businesses and investment funds. 

Our
Company competes on the basis of a number of factors, including our geographic focus on Appalachia, access to mission-driven energy-transition
capital, access to impact investing opportunities, strategic relationships with reclamation bond insurance companies, recruitment and
retention of key personnel, market share with key customers, and supply relationships with critical vendors. Our ability to continue
to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. 

Information
Systems 

In
2023, the Company engaged Foundation Software, LLC Foundation Software as its new accounting software provider and converted
all of the Company s accounting system operations from QuickBooks to Foundation Software during the second quarter of 2023. 

Founded
in Cleveland, Ohio in 1985, Foundation Software is specifically designed for service companies, particularly those in the construction,
contracting and reclamation industries. Foundation Software offers the Company several enhanced features critical to the successful execution
of its shareholder value creation plan, including: (i) general ledger accounting, including accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory
and customer billing; (ii) equipment tracking on job sites, maintenance, utilization and depreciation; (iii) employee tracking on job
sites, time and materials, utilization, and billing; (iv) job costing and profitability reporting segmented by customers, job types and
location and (v) numerous real-time management dashboard and key performance indicator reports that will allow management to closely
monitor financial and operational performance and quickly react to business opportunities and issues. Furthermore, Foundation Software
will allow the Company to quickly scale operations and efficiently and cost-effectively support the anticipated growth of each business,
thereby preventing our accounting and management systems from becoming a limiting factor to our growth initiatives.

The Company s revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was 3,998,267, its gross profit was 845,101 and net income was
 36,762. The 1,648,529 reduction in quarterly revenue was due to a 1,693,416 reduction in revenue from the Range Reclaim
and Range Minerals business segments primarily due to a failure of performance by a mining subcontractor, which was partially offset by
a 44,887 increase in revenue from the Range Security business segment primarily due to the performance of a new security services contract
at a second mine site. 

For
the three months ended June 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 697,699 compared to 583,964 incurred for the three
months ended June 30, 2023. This 113,735 increase in general and administrative expenses are primarily due to the costs of
additional employees and consultants hired in anticipation of the projected long-term growth of the Range Reclaim and Range
Minerals business segments, offset by the partial re-allocation to the Graphium Biosciences business segment of the salaries and benefits of
a corporate executive.

the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company incurred research and development costs of 157,278 compared to 107,444 for the
three months ended June 30, 2023. This 49,834 increase in research and development costs was due to the full allocation of
employment costs of a corporate executive who was transitioned from the Company to the Graphium Biosciences business segment effective March 31, 2024. 

For
the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company incurred net other expenses in the amount of 221,775 compared to net other
expenses of 116,931 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. This 104,844 increase was primarily attributable to increased
interest expense of 48,729 and state income taxes of 56,600 for the three months
ended June 30, 2024. There was no state tax expense incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2023. 

The
net loss during the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 1,225,681 compared to net income of 36,762 for the three months ended June
30, 2023. This 1,262,443 decrease in net income was due to lower revenue of 1,648,529, lower gross profit of 994,030, higher operating
expenses of 163,569 and higher other expense of 104,844. 

Six
Months Ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 

The
Company s revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 6,259,631, its gross loss was 130,075 and net loss was 2,439,521.
The Company s revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was 7,013,154, its gross profit was 1,494,103 and net loss was
 190,098. The 753,523 reduction in revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was related to a 1,193,805 reduction
in revenue from the Range Reclaim and Range Minerals business segments primarily due to a failure of performance by a mining subcontractor,
which decline was partially offset by a 440,282 increase in revenue from the Range Security business segment primarily due to its growth
with its first customer and the performance of a new security services contract at a second mine site for the six months ended June 30,
2024. 

25 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 1,641,600 compared to 1,310,012 incurred for the six
months ended June 30, 2023. This 331,588 increase in general and administrative expenses are primarily due to the costs of
additional employees and consultants hired in anticipation of the projected long-term growth of the Range Reclaim and Range Minerals
business segments, offset by the partial re-allocation to the Graphium Biosciences business segment of the salaries and benefit of
a corporate executive during the second quarter of 2024. 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company incurred research and development costs of 288,918 compared to 213,621 for the six
months ended June 30, 2023. This 75,297 increase in research and development costs was due to the full allocation of employment
costs of a corporate executive who was transitioned from the Corporate business segment to the Graphium Biosciences business segment
effective March 31, 2024, and costs associated with the capital raise process to advance its drug development program. 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company incurred net other expenses in the amount of 378,928 compared to net other expenses
of 160,568 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This 218,360 increase was primarily attributable to increased interest expense
of 180,350 and state income taxes of 56,600 for the six months ended June 30,
2024. There was no state tax expense incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

The
net loss during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 2,439,521 compared to a net loss of 190,098 for the six months ended June 30,
2023. This 2,249,423 decrease in net income was due to lower revenue of 753,523, lower gross profit of 1,624,178, higher operating
expenses of 406,885 and higher other expense of 218,360. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of June 30, 2024, the Company had total current assets of 6,655,093, comprised of: (i) cash of 123,713; (ii) accounts receivable of
 4,388,785; (iii) contract assets of 1,374,962; (iv) inventory of 725,429 and (v) prepaid expenses of 42,204. As of June 30, 2024,
the Company had total current liabilities of 7,058,714, comprised of: (v) outstanding amounts on the lines of credit of 2,200,000;
(w) accounts payable of 2,036,868; (x) accrued expenses of 54,402, (y) deposit of 150,000 and (z) the current portion of long-term
debt of 2,617,444. As a result, as of June 30, 2024, the Company had negative working capital of 403,621. As of December 31, 2023,
the Company had positive working capital of 753,756. This 1,157, 377 decrease in working capital is the result of lower sales
in the amount of 1,648,529 during the six months ended June 30, 2024, which has translated into lower non-cash current assets of 1,016,655
and lower non-debt current liabilities of 1,574,027, for a net decrease of non-cash and non-debt working capital of 557,362 during the
six months ended June 30, 2024. Also, during the six months ended June 30, 2024, 2,053,087 of cash was used to fund the aforementioned
 557,362 decrease of non-cash and non-debt working capital, repayment of 338,348 of the current portion of long-term debt, and the repayment
of 1,051,208 of long-term debt. 

As
of June 30, 2024, the Company had long-term assets of 12,786,427, comprised of: (i) net equipment assets of 10,289,443; (ii) land of
 1,563,797; (iii) buildings of 171,790; (iv) goodwill of 751,421; and (v) deposits of 9,976. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had
long-term liabilities of 4,198,819, entirely comprised of long-term debt, net of current portion. As of December 31, 2023, the Company
had long-term assets of 14,063,299, comprised of: (v) net equipment assets of 11,549,689; (w) land of 1,563,797; (x) building of 188,416;
(y) goodwill of 751,421; and (z) deposits of 9,976. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had long-term liabilities of 5,250,027, entirely
comprised of long-term debt, net of current portion. 

Based
on the Company s current corporate strategy, we expect our general operating expenses to be substantially offset by revenue
generated by the Range Reclaim and Range Security business segments, and the collection of significant outstanding accounts
receivables from the Company s largest customer. While we expect the Company s operating businesses to generate operating
losses over the 12 months following June 30, 2024, based on the Company s current cash balance and the anticipated
collection of significant outstanding accounts receivable, the Company expects to have sufficient funds to operate its business over
the next 12 months. If additional capital is needed in excess of our current capital resources, we will explore financing options to
accelerate the funding and execution of our growth strategy and shareholder value creation plan. 

26 

Our
estimated total expenditures for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2025 could increase if we encounter unanticipated lower revenues
and higher expenses in connection with operating our business as presently planned. In addition, our estimates of the amount of cash
necessary to fund our business may prove to be too low, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently
expect. If we cannot raise the capital necessary to continue to develop our business, we will be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate
some or all of our proposed operations. If any of these were to occur, there is a substantial risk that our business would fail. 

Until
such time as the Company and its operating businesses are cash flow positive, we expect to continue funding our operations, at least
in part, through equity and debt financings. However, sources of additional funds may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms,
or at all. If we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds or to fund, in whole or in part, acquisitions
in furtherance of our business strategy, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and the new equity or debt securities
may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, we would incur
additional interest expenses, and assuming those loans would be available, it would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
Moreover, regardless of the manner in which we seek to raise capital, we may incur substantial costs in those pursuits, including investment
banking fees, legal fees and other related costs. 

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1,663,531, compared to net cash used in operating
activities of 398,399 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This 1,265,132 increase was primarily due to a 2,249,423 increase
in loss from continued operations that was primarily driven by reduced sales and profitability in our Range Reclaim and Range
Minerals business segments, and higher costs of additional employees and consultants hired in anticipation of the projected
long-term growth of those business segments, offset by higher non-cash depreciation expense of 580,962 due to the Company s
larger investment in equipment and a 382,769 reduction in cash used to fund the Company s working capital. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 0, compared to net cash provided by investing
activities of 784,515 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June
30, 2023 consisted of equipment purchases and capital expenditures. Based on the Company s current corporate strategy, no
additional equipment purchases are required to execute its near-term strategic plan; however, if additional equipment is required in
the future, the Company anticipates securing such equipment through third-party equipment leases or
equipment financings. Future capital expenditures required to maintain the Company s existing equipment are anticipated to be
funded with cash on hand. 

Net
Cash Provided By Financing Activities 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024, the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows (used in) provided by
financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below: 

During
 the six months ended June 30, 2024, we received aggregate proceeds of 1,410,000 from the sale of our common stock in
 privately-negotiated transactions. 

During
 the six months ended June 30, 2024, we repaid 1,389,556 of our indebtedness. 

During
 the six months ended June 30, 2023, we received proceeds of 383,202 from the issuance of long-term debt and 1,200,000 from a line
 of credit, offset by the repayment of long-term debt of 893,093. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that would be material to stockholders. 

27 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. 

We
regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management s
estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from the estimates made by management. 

We
believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements included in this report: 

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The more significant
estimates and assumption by management include, among others, assumptions used in valuing assets acquired in business acquisitions, reserves
for accounts receivable, assumptions used in valuing equity instruments issued for services, the valuation allowance for deferred tax
assets, accruals for potential liabilities, and assumptions used in the determination of the Company s liquidity. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Business
Combinations 

Business
combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under ASC 805, Business Combinations. This method
requires the Company to record assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition
date. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the
fair value requires management to make estimates and assumptions including discount rates, rates of return on assets, and long-term sales
growth rates. 

Goodwill 

As
referenced by ASC 350 Intangibles- Goodwill and other ASC 350 ), management performs its annual test for
goodwill at least annually or more frequently, if impairment indicators arise. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The core principle of the revenue standard
is that a company should recognize revenue by analyzing the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify
the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company primarily invoices customers
and recognizes revenue on a periodic basis for equipment and labor hours provided to a customer on a particular job based on an agreed-upon
hourly rate sheet or a fixed amount for a project. The Company also invoices customers and recognizes revenue for equipment mobilization
fees and materials and supplies required to complete a project. The Company invoices for the sales of chemicals and recognizes revenue
when the products are delivered to the customer s designated site. Costs for equipment, labor and chemicals are generally expensed
as incurred since the projects are generally short-term and not subject to a contract. The Company also invoices customers for the provision
of environmental security services on an agreed-upon hourly rate for each project. All revenue is recognized at a point in time. 

The
Company recognizes revenue from contracts for financial reporting purposes over time. Progress toward completion of the Company s
contracts is measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to estimated total costs for each contract. This method is
used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on contracts. Because of inherent uncertainties
in estimating costs, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change significantly within the near term. 

28 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company periodically issues stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions
for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for such grants issued and vesting based on ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation
whereby the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized for employees as compensation expense on the straight-line
basis over the vesting period. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner as if the Company
had paid cash for the services.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not
Applicable. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and
other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our Disclosure Controls and Procedures DCPs as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. 

Based on such evaluation at the time our Form 10-Q
for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was filed, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of March
31, 2024, our DCPs were effective at a reasonable assurance level. Subsequent to that evaluation and as a result of the material weakness
in our ICFR discussed below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that during the three-month period
ended March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Our internal control over financial reporting did not
result in the proper accounting classification of financial information and presentation which, due to its material impact on our financial
statements, we determined to be a material weakness. Therefore, on August 8, 2024, the Company filed a Form 10-Q/A for the three months
ended March 31, 2024, which corrected the accounting error of a vendor invoice that was inadvertently recorded in April 2024 rather than
the proper period of March 2024. 

Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in Internal Control over Financial Reporting ICFR ), such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. 

We did not maintain effective controls over expense
recording and accruals. Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls to timely identify and account for period cutoff and accruals
to the proper period. This material weakness resulted in the restatement of our financial statements for the three months ended March
31, 2024. 

Remediation Plan 

Upon identification of the material weakness, our
management developed a remediation plan to address the material weakness, which includes updating our procedures regarding the review
of expenses and accruals of expenses to the proper period. 

Our management believes the measures described above
and others that may be implemented will remediate the material weakness that we have identified. However, the material weakness will not
be considered remediated until there has been appropriate time for us to conclude through testing that the controls are operating effectively. 

As our management continues to evaluate and improve
our ICFR, we may decide to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify certain remediation measures
identified. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting during the six months ended June 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
