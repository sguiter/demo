 shares of its common stock at a price of per share, which includes shares sold to First Seacoast Bank s Employee Stock Ownership Plan. As part of the conversion transaction, each outstanding share of First Seacoast Bancorp (a federal corporation) common stock owned by the public stockholders of First Seacoast Bancorp (a federal corporation) (stockholders other than First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC) as of the closing date was converted into shares of First Seacoast Bancorp, Inc. common stock based on an exchange ratio of shares of First Seacoast Bancorp, Inc. common stock for each share of First Seacoast Bancorp (a federal corporation) common stock. The Bank offers a full range of banking and wealth management services to its customers. The Bank focuses on core services that center around customer needs. The core services include residential lending, commercial banking, personal banking and wealth management. The Bank offers a full range of commercial and consumer banking services through its network of five full-service branch locations. The Bank is engaged principally in the business of attracting deposits from the public and investing those funds in various types of loans, including residential and commercial real estate loans, and a variety of commercial and consumer loans. The Bank also invests its deposits and borrowed funds in investment securities. Deposits at the Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC for the maximum amount permitted by law. The Company has reportable segment, Banking Services. All of the Company s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent and assessed based on how each of the activities of the Company supports the others. For example, lending is dependent upon the ability of the Company to fund itself with deposits and other borrowings and manage interest rate and credit risk. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of the Company as one segment or unit. Investment management services are offered through FSB Wealth Management. FSB Wealth Management is a division of First Seacoast Bank. The division currently consists of two financial advisors who are located in Dover, New Hampshire. FSB Wealth Management provides access to non-FDIC insured products that include retirement planning, portfolio management, investment and insurance strategies, business retirement plans and college planning to individuals throughout our primary market area. These investments and services are offered through a third-party registered broker-dealer and investment advisor. FSB Wealth Management receives fees from advisory services and commissions on individual investment and insurance products purchased by clients. The assets held for wealth management customers are not assets of the Company and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Company s consolidated balance sheets.

. The client accounts purchased are recorded as a customer list intangible asset. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization will be reviewed for impairment, at least annually, based on their fair value. Any impairment will be recognized as a charge to earnings and the adjusted carrying amount of the intangible asset will become its new accounting basis. The remaining useful life of the intangible asset will also be evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The Company is amortizing the customer list intangible on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, of amortization expense was recorded in other expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of amortization expense was recorded in other expense, respectively. Customer list intangible balances included in other assets are and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs"). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have an immaterial impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In March 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2024-02, Codification Improvements, which amends the Codification to remove references to various concepts statements and impacts a variety of topics in the Codification. The amendments apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance, but in most instances the references removed are extraneous and not required to understand or apply the guidance. Generally, the amendments in ASU 2024-02 are not intended to result in significant accounting changes for most entities. ASU 2024-02 is effective January 1, 2025 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, " Income Taxes- Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" , which will require enhancements and further transparency to various income tax disclosures, most notably the tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis. Retrospective application for all periods presented is permitted. Early adoption is also permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on our disclosures.

Management evaluates securities available-for-sale in unrealized loss positions to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Consideration is given to (1) the extent to which the fair value is less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. At September 30, 2024, the Company had securities available-for-sale in an unrealized loss position without an allowance for credit losses. Management does not have the intent to sell any of these securities and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, management believes that the unrealized losses detailed in the previous table are due to noncredit-related factors, including changes in market interest rates and other market conditions, and therefore the Company carried no allowance for credit losses on securities available-for-sale as of September 30, 2024.

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were gross realized gains or losses on securities available-for-sale for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million of securities available-for-sale were pledged as collateral for the Company's Bank Term Funding Program and Borrower-In-Custody secured credit facilities, respectively (see Note 6 Borrowings for more information). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were holdings of securities of any issuer, other than the SBA, FHLMC, GNMA and FNMA, whose aggregate carrying value exceeded 10 of stockholders equity.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans ("ACL") Effective , the Company the new accounting standard for credit losses, ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, as amended ("ASU 2016-13"). This new accounting standard, commonly referred to as "CECL," significantly changed the methodology for accounting for reserves on loans and unfunded off-balance sheet ("OBS") credit exposures, including certain unfunded loan commitments and standby guarantees. ASU 2016-13 replaced the "incurred loss" methodology used to establish an allowance on loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures, with an "expected loss" approach. Under CECL, the ACL at each reporting period serves as a best estimate of projected credit losses over the contractual life of certain assets, adjusted for expected prepayments, given an expectation of economic conditions and forecasts as of the valuation date. Upon adoption of CECL, the Company made the following elections regarding accrued interest receivable: (i) present accrued interest receivable balances separately on the balance sheet on the consolidated statements of condition; (ii) exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the ACL, including investments and loans; and (iii) continue to write-off accrued interest receivable by reversing interest income. The Company has a policy in place to write-off accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Accrued interest is written-off by reversing previously recorded interest income. For loans, write-off typically occurs when a loan has been in default for 90 days or more. An immaterial amount of accrued interest on non-accrual loans was written off during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, by reversing interest income. Historically, the Company has not experienced uncollectible accrued interest receivable on its securities available-for-sale. The ACL is the sum of various components including the following: (a) historical loss experience, (b) a reasonable and supportable forecast, (c) loans evaluated individually, and (d) changes in relevant environmental factors. The historical loss component is segmented by loan type and serves as the core of the ACL adequacy methodology. The Company has selected the Weighted Average Remaining Maturity Model WARM ), for the loss calculation of each of the Bank s loan pools utilizing a third-party software application. The WARM uses a quarterly loss rate and future expectations of loan balances to calculate an ACL. A loss rate is applied to pool balances over time. CECL may create more volatility in the ACL, specifically the ACL on loans and ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures. Under CECL, the ACL may increase or decrease period to period based on many factors, including, but not limited to: (i)

The Company's collateral-dependent non-accrual RES and HELOC loans with one borrower had an amortized cost basis of at December 31, 2023, and was secured by real estate with an appraised value of . The property was sold on July 19, 2024 and all outstanding balances were repaid. Interest income recognized on non-accrual loans during three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was - -. There were loans past due over 90 days still accruing interest at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There were loans collateralized by residential real estate property in the process of foreclosure at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There were no loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification, if applicable. The ACL incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon origination. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty would already be included in the ACL as a result of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change in the ACL is generally not recorded upon modification. Credit Quality Information The Company utilizes a ten-grade internal loan rating system for its commercial real estate, multifamily, commercial and industrial and acquisition, development, and land loans. Residential real estate, home equity line of credit and consumer loans are considered pass rated loans until they become delinquent. Once delinquent, loans can be rated an 8, 9 or 10 as applicable. Loans rated 1 through 6: Loans in these categories are considered pass rated loans with low to average risk. Loans rated 7: Loans in this category are considered special mention. These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are being closely monitored by management.

with a risk rating of 5 or better. These relationships are monitored based upon performance standards by the assigned lending officer. On a quarterly basis, the Company formally reviews the ratings on its applicable residential real estate and home equity loans if they have become classified as non-accrual. Criteria used to determine ratings consist of loan-to-value ratios and days delinquent.

Equity Incentive Plan Effective May 27, 2021, the Company adopted the First Seacoast Bancorp 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan ). The Company s stockholders approved the 2021 plan on that date. The 2021 Plan provides for the granting of incentive and non-statutory stock options to purchase shares of common stock and the granting of shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. The 2021 Plan authorizes the issuance or delivery to participants of up to converted shares of common stock (adjusted for the second step conversion transaction). Of this number, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of stock options is shares (adjusted for the second step conversion transaction) and the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units is shares (adjusted for the second step conversion transaction). The exercise price of stock options may not be less than the fair market value on the date the stock option is granted. Further, stock options may not be granted with a term that is longer than years. On May 25, 2023, incentive and non-statutory stock options to purchase shares of common stock were granted to directors for their services on the board of directors and certain members of management. The Company estimates the grant date fair value of each option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the common stock consistent with the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend yields of the common stock. Since it was determined that the Company lacked sufficient historical closing stock prices, the expected volatility assumption was based upon a combination of actual historical volatility combined with the historical volatility developed for comparable companies. Also, since the Company lacked the appropriate historical data, the expected term of the option was calculated using the simplified method. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if

 years. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2022 and began recognizing its operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet by recording a net lease liability, representing the Company s legal obligation to make these lease payments, and a Right-Of-Use ROU asset, representing the Company s legal right to use the leased assets. The Company, by policy, does not include renewal options for leases as part of its ROU asset and lease liabilities unless they are deemed reasonably certain to exercise. The Company does not have any sub-lease agreements. The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease based on whether a contract, or a part of a contract, conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The discount rate is either implicit in the lease or, when a rate cannot be readily determined, the Company s incremental borrowing rate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term. On June 11, 2024, the Bank entered into and closed on an agreement with a single purchaser for the purchase and sale of properties formerly owned and operated by the Bank, which included branches (with an adjacent drive thru) and a parking lot, each adjacent to a sold branch, for an aggregate cash purchase price of million. Concurrently with the sale-leaseback transaction, the Bank entered into an absolute net lease agreement with the purchaser under which the Bank will lease the properties for an initial term of years with renewal option of years. The lease agreement includes a annual rent escalation during the initial term and during the renewal term, if exercised. The sale-leaseback transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of million which is included in non-interest income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss). The Company s operating lease ROU asset and corresponding operating lease liability of million primarily resulted in an increase in ROU assets and lease liabilities at September 30, 2024 (included in other assets and other liabilities), compared to December 31, 2023. Additionally, the Company recorded a million finance lease liability related to this agreement representing the portion of the gain not eligible for immediate recognition. The Company's obligation under this operating lease expires in and has future lease payments of million as of September 30, 2024. Total lease expense for this operating lease was and - - for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and - - for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

Total lease expense for this obligation was for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This lease agreement contains clauses calling for escalation of minimum lease payments contingent on increases in LIBOR, or a similar replacement index, and the consumer price index.

 million notional interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges on 90-day advances from FHLB. The purpose of these cash flow hedges was to reduce potential interest rate risk by swapping a variable rate borrowing to a fixed rate. Management deemed it prudent to limit the variability of these interest payments by entering into these interest rate swap agreements. These agreements provided for the Company to receive payments at a variable rate determined by a specific index (three-month LIBOR) in exchange for making payments at a fixed rate. Publication of LIBOR is expected to cease in December of 2024. The swap agreements allowed for substitution of an alternative reference rate such as the secured overnight financing rate SOFR at that time. On January 17, 2023, the Company terminated both of its interest rate swap derivative instruments at a gain of . The Company recognized the change in fair value of these hedging instruments, previously accumulated in AOCI, as a gain on termination of interest rate swaps in its consolidated statement of income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as it was determined that it was probable that the hedged forecasted transaction - the variability in cash flows related to 90-day advances from the FHLB - would not occur by the end of the original maturity dates of the hedging instruments. The use of derivatives for debt hedging as part of the Company's overall interest rate risk management strategy has been infrequent as the Company has utilized other interest rate risk management activities to achieve similar business purposes. Also, of cash posted to the counterparty as collateral on these interest rate swaps contracts was returned to the Company. The changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps were reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and were subsequently reclassified into interest expense or income in the period that the hedged transactions affected earnings. The change in fair value for these derivative instruments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was - -, and - - and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On July 12, 2024, the Company entered into a two-year interest rate contract that was designated as fair value hedge utilizing a pay fixed interest rate swap to hedge a portion of its index-based brokered deposits included in savings deposits and its change in fair value attributable to the movement in the one-month SOFR. The carrying amount of the hedged liability located in savings deposits" includes the savings account balance used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged items are the stated amount of liabilities anticipated to be outstanding for the designated hedged period. The carrying amount of the savings deposit used in the hedged relationship was million. Under the "portfolio layer" approach, the Company designated a million notional amount of portfolio liabilities that are not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults and other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows of the designated hedged layer. At inception, this fair value hedge has a pay fixed rate of and a received rate of . The change in the fair value of the interest rate swap was reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and was subsequently reclassified into interest expense or income in the period that the hedged transaction affected earnings.

Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk During 2023, the Company entered into interest rate contracts that were designated as fair value hedges utilizing a pay fixed interest rate swap to hedge portions of the residential mortgage loan portfolio's change in fair value attributable to the movement in the one-month SOFR. Additionally, the Company entered into an interest rate contract that was designated as fair value hedge utilizing a pay fixed interest rate swap to hedge a portion of the securities available-for-sale municipal bond portfolio's change in fair value attributable to the movement in the one-month SOFR. The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain pools of fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. The Company's interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. The hedging strategy effectively converts these fixed-rate assets to SOFR floating rate assets for the term of the swap starting on the effective date. For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income. 

Total loans 

Total 

The carrying amount of the hedged asset located in total loans includes the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios of fixed-rate residential loans used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged items are the stated amount of assets anticipated to be outstanding for the designated hedged period. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios of fixed-rate residential loans used in the hedging relationship was in excess of the carrying amount of the hedged asset. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cumulative basis adjustments associated with this hedging relationship was and , respectively; and the notional amount of the designated hedged item was million. Under the "portfolio layer" approach, the Company designated a million notional amount of portfolio assets that are not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults and other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows of the designated hedged layer. The carrying amount of the hedged asset located in securities available-for-sale, at fair value includes the principal amount of municipal bonds used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged items are the stated amount of assets anticipated to be outstanding for the designated hedged period. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the par value of the municipal bonds used in this hedging relationship was million; the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging relationships was and , respectively; and the notional amount of the designated hedged items were million. Under the "portfolio layer" approach, the Company designated a million notional amount of portfolio assets that are not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults and other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows of the designated hedged layer. The notional amounts of these agreements do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of potential loss exposure. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s fair value hedges had a remaining maturity of and years, respectively, an average pay fixed rate of and an average received rate of . Derivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments Customer Loan Swaps Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain commercial banking customers. On May 19, 2023, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a commercial loan borrower. The Company executes interest rate swaps with customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. The interest rate swap contract with the commercial loan borrower allows them to convert floating-rate loan payments based on SOFR to fixed-rate loan payments. This interest rate swap is simultaneously hedged by an offsetting derivative that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivative and the offsetting derivative are recognized directly in earnings.

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features By entering into derivative transactions, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as required. Should a counterparty fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract, the Company s credit exposure on interest rate swaps is limited to the net positive fair value and accrued interest of all swaps with each counterparty. The Company seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, and other monitoring procedures. Institutional counterparties must have an investment grade credit rating and be approved by the Company s board of directors. As such, management believes the risk of incurring credit losses on derivative contracts with institutional counterparties is remote. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company posted million and million, respectively, of cash to the counterparties as collateral on its interest rate swap contracts and customer loan swaps, which was presented within cash and due from banks on the consolidated balance sheets.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s mortgage servicing rights are the weighted-average prepayment rate, weighted-average discount rate, weighted average delinquency rate and weighted-average default rate. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Although the prepayment rate and the discount rate are not directly interrelated, they generally move in opposite directions of each other. The Company estimates the fair value of mortgage servicing rights by using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income. Observable and unobservable inputs are entered into this model as prescribed by an independent third party to arrive at an estimated fair value.

assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Non-Financial Assets and Non-Financial Liabilities: The Company has non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis generally include certain foreclosed assets which, upon initial recognition, were remeasured and reported at fair value through a charge-off to the allowance for loan losses and certain foreclosed assets which, subsequent to their initial recognition, are remeasured at fair value through a write-down included in other non-interest expense. There were foreclosed assets at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are discussed above. ASC Topic 825 requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. The exit price notion is a market-based measurement of fair value that is represented by the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) on the measurement date. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, fair values of loans are estimated on an exit price basis incorporating discounts for credit, liquidity and marketability factors.

Item 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 General 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the Company s consolidated financial condition at September 30, 2024 and consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. It should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report and with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed on March 29, 2024 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
 Overview 
 Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings from the FHLB, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate and multi-family loans, acquisition, development and land loans, commercial and industrial loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans. In recent years, we have increased our focus, consistent with what we believe to be conservative underwriting standards, on originating higher yielding commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. 
 We conduct our operations from four full-service banking offices in Strafford County, New Hampshire and one full-service banking office in Rockingham County, New Hampshire. We consider our primary lending market area to be Strafford and Rockingham Counties in New Hampshire and York County in Southern Maine.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. 
 Our critical accounting policies involve the calculation of the allowance for credit losses ("ACL") and the measurement of the fair value of financial instruments. A detailed description of these critical accounting policies can be found in Note 2 of the Company s consolidated financial statements contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 (unaudited) and December 31, 2023 
 Total Assets. Total assets were 601.8 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 30.7 million, or 5.4 , compared to total assets of 571.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was due primarily to a 10.4 million increase in cash and due from banks, a 7.9 million increase in net loans, a 11.2 million increase in securities available-for-sale, and a 5.0 million increase in other assets, offset by a 3.4 million decrease in land, building and equipment, net. The increase in other assets and decrease in land, building and equipment, net, was due primarily to accounting for the sale-leaseback transaction encompassing the Bank's main office and branches which was completed on June 11, 2024. 
 Cash and Due From Banks. Cash and due from banks increased 10.4 million, or 172.2 , to 16.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 6.1 million at December 31, 2023. This increase primarily resulted from a 42.9 million increase in total deposits and 7.4 million of net proceeds from the sale of land and building, offset by a 20.7 million decrease in borrowings, a 7.9 million increase in net loans, a 11.2 million increase in securities available-for-sale, and 3.3 million of common stock repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Available-for-Sale Securities. Available-for-sale securities increased by 11.2 million, or 9.2 , to 133.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 121.9 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to investment purchases totaling 18.1 million and a 1.5 million decrease in net unrealized losses within the portfolio, offset by 8.1 million of proceeds from maturities and principal payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The unrealized losses within the portfolio are due to noncredit-related factors, including changes in market interest rates and other market conditions, and therefore we recorded no allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as of September 30, 2024.

Net Loans. Net loans increased 7.9 million, or 1.9 , to 434.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 426.6 million at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated 5.9 million of loans, net of principal collections, and purchased 1.8 million of participation interests in commercial and industrial loans through our membership in a national community bank loan program. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the portfolio of purchased loans had an outstanding principal balance of 34.1 million and 33.3 million, respectively, and were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms. 
 One- to four-family residential mortgage loans increased 10.9 million, or 4.0 , to 279.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 268.9 million at December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate mortgage loans decreased 870,000, or 1.0 , to 85.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 86.6 million at December 31, 2023. Multi-family loans decreased 1.8 million, or 23.2 , to 5.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 7.6 million at December 31, 2023. Commercial and industrial loans decreased 1.4 million, or 5.6 , to 24.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 25.5 million at December 31, 2023. Acquisition, development, and land loans decreased 3.9 million, or 22.4 , to 13.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 17.5 million at December 31, 2023. Home equity loans and lines of credit increased 2.6 million, or 18.3 , to 16.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 14.1 million at December 31, 2023. Consumer loans increased 2.5 million, or 25.0 , to 12.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 9.8 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Our strategy to grow the balance sheet continues to be through originations and, to a lesser extent, purchases of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans, and consumer loans secured by manufactured housing properties, while also diversifying into higher yielding commercial real estate mortgage loans and commercial and industrial loans to improve net margins and manage interest rate risk. We also continue to consider selling selected, conforming 15-year and 30-year residential fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market on a servicing retained basis as market conditions allow, providing us a recurring source of revenue from loan servicing income and gains on the sale of such loans. 
 Our ACL on loans was 3.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company measures and records it ACL based upon ASC Topic 326 and its credit impairment standard for financial assets measured at amortized cost and available-for-sale debt securities. ASC Topic 326 requires financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an ACL that are expected to occur over the remaining life of the asset, rather than incurred losses. ASC Topic 326 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for loans held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Accordingly, ASC Topic 326 requires the use of forward-looking information to form credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied at prior reporting dates are still permitted, though the inputs to those techniques have changed to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. The Bank has 
 41 

selected the Weighted Average Remaining Maturity Model WARM or "CECL model"), for the loss calculation of each of the Bank s loan pools utilizing a third-party software application. The WARM uses a quarterly loss rate and future expectations of loan balances to calculate an ACL. A loss rate is applied to pool balances over time. 
 The effect of implementing ASC Topic 326 was recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment through retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period in which ASC Topic 326 is effective, which was January 1, 2023. The adoption of the new standard resulted in a 295,000 decrease to the ACL which was partially offset by a 290,000 increase in the allowance for off-balance sheet commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable. The decrease in ACL was due to a reduced emphasis on qualitative factors under the CECL model as the underlying historical loss data of the selected peer group is more robust with broader time horizons as compared to our actual historical loss data used under the incurred loss methodology. Under the CECL model, subsequent changes in the ACL are recorded through a charge to the provision for credit losses in the statement of income as the amounts expected to be collected change. 
 Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits, for both individuals and businesses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of uninsured deposit balances, which is the portion exceeding the 250,000 FDIC insurance limit, was estimated not to exceed 110.3 million, or 24.7 of total deposits, and 102.5 million, or 25.3 of total deposits, respectively. 
 For customers requiring full FDIC insurance on certificates of deposit in excess of 250,000, we began offering in late 2023 the CDARS program, which allows us to place the certificates of deposit with other participating banks to maximize the customers FDIC insurance coverage. We receive a like amount of deposits from other participating financial institutions. In addition, we offer the ICS program, an insured deposit sweep program for demand deposits which is a product offered by IntraFi Network, LLC, which is also the provider of the CDARS program. Similarly to the certificates of deposit s discussed above, we receive a like amount of deposits from other financial institutions and all customer deposits are insured by the FDIC. These reciprocal CDARS and ICS deposits are classified as brokered deposits in regulatory reports and "core" deposits in our consolidated balance sheet. At September 30, 2024 our reciprocal CDARS and ICS deposits were -0- and 6.4 million, respectively. At December 31, 2023, our reciprocal CDARS and ICS deposits were -0- and 1.1 million, respectively. 
 Deposits increased 42.9 million, or 10.6 , to 447.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 404.8 million at December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of an 14.9 million increase in commercial deposits and a 28.0 million increase in retail deposits. Core deposits (defined as deposits other than time deposits) increased 6.2 million, or 2.0 , to 319.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 313.5 million at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, savings deposits increased 16.3 million, money market deposits decreased 12.5 million, NOW and demand deposit accounts increased 2.4 million and time deposits increased 36.7 million. There were 56.7 million and 23.6 million of brokered deposits included in time deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Additionally, there were 21.8 million and 20.9 million of brokered deposits included in savings deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Deposits from related parties totaled 12.1 million and 10.7 million at of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Borrowings. Total borrowings decreased 20.7 million, or 22.3 , to 72.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 93.0 million at December 31, 2023. Advances from FHLB decreased 20.7 million, or 28.4 , to 52.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 73.0 million at December 31, 2023 due primarily to a 42.9 million increase in total deposits offset by borrowings required in support of the Company s investment and loan growth initiatives. 
 Total Stockholders Equity. Total stockholders equity decreased 829,000, or 1.2 , to 65.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 66.6 million at December 31, 2023. This decrease was due primarily to 3.3 million of common stock repurchases offset by other comprehensive income of 969,000 related to net changes in unrealized holding losses in the available-for-sale securities portfolio as a result of decreases in market interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income of 895,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the recognition of 421,000 of previously unearned compensation. 
 Non-performing Assets. Non-performing assets include loans that are 90 or more days past due or on non-accrual status and real estate and other loan collateral acquired through foreclosure and repossession. Management determines that a loan is non-performing when it is probable at least a portion of the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When a loan is determined to be non-performing, the measurement of the loan in the ACL is based on present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for non-performance based on the fair value of the collateral. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. 
 We generally cease accruing interest on our loans when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. Interest received on non-accrual loans generally is applied against principal or applied to interest on a cash basis. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual 
 42 

terms for at least six consecutive months and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. 
 Non-performing loans were -0- and 141,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2023, non-performing loans consisted of a residential mortgage loan and an associated home equity loan with outstanding balances totaling 141,000 and an estimated collateral market value of 216,000. The property was sold on July 19, 2024 and all outstanding balances were repaid. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no foreclosed assets. 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Net Income (Loss). Net income was 44,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 911,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 955,000, or 104.8 . The increase was due primarily to a 415,000 increase in net interest and dividend income, a 104,000 decrease in provision for credit losses, a decrease in non-interest expenses of 173,000, and a 213,000 increase in income tax benefit during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased 1.4 million, or 26.9 , to 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to a 567,000 increase in interest and dividend income on investments and a 820,000 increase in interest and fees on loans. 
 Average interest-earning assets increased 38.4 million, to 574.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 536.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average annualized yield on interest earning-assets increased to 4.56 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.85 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in market interest rates. The weighted average annualized yield for the loan portfolio increased to 4.67 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in market interest rates. The weighted average annualized yield for all other interest-earning assets increased to 4.22 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.00 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in market interest rates. 
 Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased 972,000, or 37.4 , to 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits increased 1.0 million, or 62.5 , to 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased 47.3 million, or 14.4 , to 375.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 328.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of an increase in the average balance of savings and time deposits offset by a decrease in the average balances of money market deposits and NOW and demand deposits. The weighted average annualized rate of interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.88 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.03 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of an increase in market interest rates. 
 Interest expense on borrowings decreased 71,000 to 857,000, or 7.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 928,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of borrowings. The average balance of borrowings decreased 5.8 million, or 7.4 , to 72.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 78.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average annualized rate of borrowings decreased to 4.73 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.75 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Interest and Dividend Income. Net interest and dividend income increased 415,000, or 16.2 , to 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to an increase of 38.4 million, or 7.2 , in the average balance of interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of increases in the average balances of loans, taxable debt securities, and interest-bearing deposits with other banks offset by a decrease in the average balances of non-taxable debt securities and Federal Home Loan Bank stock, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, offset by a 41.6 million, or 10.2 , increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of increases in the average balances of savings and time deposits, offset by decreases in the average balances of borrowings, money market deposits and NOW and demand deposits. Annualized net interest margin increased to 2.08 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.92 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets offset by an increase in the average rate of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. 
 Provision (Release) for Credit Losses. Based on management s analysis of the ACL, a 16,000 provision for credit losses was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 120,000 provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of a 20,000 provision for credit losses on loans and a (4,000) release of credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of a 30,000 provision for credit losses on loans and a 90,000 provision for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures. 
 43 

Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased 50,000, or 15.9 , to 364,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 314,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to a 41,000 increase in investment service fees. 
 Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense decreased 173,000, or 4.2 , to 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 169,000, or 6.8 , decrease in salaries and employee benefits, a 71,000, or 40.8 , decrease in marketing, a 42,000, or 36.5 , decrease in equipment expense and a 60,000, or 14.9 , decrease in data processing offset by a 114,000, or 55.6 , increase in occupancy expense and a 50,000, or 25.5 , increase in professional fees and assessments. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the adjustment of staffing levels in late 2023 reflecting the expected reduction in 2024 residential mortgage and commercial lending activity offset by normal salary increases. The increase in occupancy expense was due primarily to the increase in lease expense associated with the sale-leaseback transaction completed on June 11, 2024. 
 Income Taxes. Income tax benefit increased 213,000, or 49.9 , to 640,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 427,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was (107.4) and (31.9) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax benefit and effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was greater than statutory federal and state rates due primarily to the reduction of 802,000 of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as of June 30, 2024 resulting from the change in accumulated other comprehensive income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, offset by a 742,000 decrease in loss before income tax benefit.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Total interest and dividend income increased 4.1 million, or 27.8 , to 18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a 1.7 million increase in interest and dividend income on investments and a 2.4 million increase in interest and fees on loans. 
 Average interest-earning assets increased 37.5 million, to 566.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 528.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average annualized yield on interest earning-assets increased to 4.45 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.73 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in market interest rates.

The increase was due to a 37.5 million, or 7.1 , increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of increases in the average balances of loans and taxable debt securities, offset by a 50.4 million, or 12.9 , increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of an increase in the average balance of borrowings, money market, savings and time deposits, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Annualized net interest margin decreased to 2.10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in the average rate of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. 
 Provision (Release) for Credit Losses. Based on management s analysis of the ACL, a (20,000) release of credit losses was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 170,000 provision for credit losses expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The release of credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of an 80,000 provision for credit losses on loans and a (100,000) release of credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures. The provision for credit losses expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of a 65,000 provision for credit losses on loans and a 105,000 provision for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures. 
 Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased 1.7 million, or 95.2 , to 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to a one-time 2.5 million gain on the sale of land and buildings recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to an 849,000 gain on termination of interest rate swaps recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense decreased 298,000, or 2.5 , to 11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 434,000, or 5.9 , decrease in salaries and employee benefits, a 89,000, or 23.5 , decrease in marketing, a 67,000, or 19.6 , decrease in equipment expense and a 153,000, or 12.8 , decrease in data processing offset by a 107,000, or 18.3 , increase in occupancy expense, a 108,000, or 55.7 , increase in deposit insurance fees and a 172,000, or 23.7 , increase in professional fees and assessments. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the adjustment of staffing levels in late 2023 reflecting the expected reduction in 2024 residential mortgage and commercial lending activity offset by normal salary increases. The increase in occupancy expense was due primarily to the increase in lease expense associated with the sale-leaseback transaction completed on June 11, 2024. 
 Income Taxes. Income tax benefit decreased 491,000, or 73.6 , to a benefit of 176,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from a benefit of 667,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was (24.4) and (40.3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in income tax benefit and the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to a 2.4 million increase in income before income tax benefit offset by the release of 398,000 of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance established at December 31, 2023 resulting from the decrease in net unrealized losses of the securities available-for-sale portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of uninsured total deposit balances, which is the portion exceeding the 250,000 FDIC insurance limit, had an estimated value not exceeding 110.3 million, or 24.7 of total deposits, and 102.5 million, or 25.3 of total deposits, respectively. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans and proceeds from sales and maturities of securities. We also rely on borrowings from the FHLB and FRB as supplemental sources of funds. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 52.3 million and 73.0 million outstanding in advances from the FHLB, respectively, and the ability to borrow an additional 94.0 million and 71.8 million, respectively, as well as an overnight line of credit for up to 3.0 million. Additionally, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had a total of 2.0 million and 5.0 million, respectively, of unsecured Fed Funds borrowing lines of credit with correspondent banks. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding balances under any of these additional credit facilities. 
 The Bank has established two secured credit facilities with the FRB Bank Term Funding Program BTFP and Borrower-In-Custody of Collateral Program BIC ). The BTFP ceased extending new loans on March 11, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 20.0 million outstanding in advances from the FRB secured by government-sponsored enterprise obligations, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by various U.S. Government agencies, owned as of March 12, 2023, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. The interest rate is the one-year overnight index swap rate plus 10 basis points and fixed for the term of the advance up to one year - on the day the advance is made. The advance matures on December 13, 2024 at a fixed annual interest rate of 4.89 . At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank s borrowing capacity is 50.6 million under the BIC and is based upon eligible collateral -principally general obligation municipal bonds. The entire balance of this credit facility was available at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. No further advances can be requested under the BTFP after March 11, 2024. 
 While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. 
 49 

Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Net cash used by operating activities was 1.2 million and 417,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and purchases, and the purchase of securities available-for-sale, offset by proceeds from the sale of land and building and unwinding of interest rate swaps, principal collections on loans and proceeds from the sale, maturity and principal payments on securities available-for-sale, was 10.1 million and 25.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of proceeds from the sale of common stock, treasury stock purchases, activity in deposit accounts and FHLB advances, was 21.7 million and 24.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position daily. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. We have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2024. Our current strategy is to increase core deposits and utilize FHLB advances, as well as brokered deposits, to fund loan growth. 
 First Seacoast Bancorp, Inc. is a separate legal entity from First Seacoast Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay its operating expenses and other financial obligations and to fund repurchases of shares of common stock. The Company s primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. The amount of dividends that the Bank may declare and pay to the Company is governed by applicable bank regulations. At September 30, 2024, the Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of 17.1 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, First Seacoast Bank exceeded all its regulatory capital requirements. See Note 12 of the unaudited consolidated financial statements appearing under Item 1 of this quarterly report. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change First Seacoast Bank s categorization as well-capitalized. 
 Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 General. Most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of loans, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, the board of directors established a management-level Asset/Liability Management Committee (the ALCO ), which takes responsibility for overseeing the asset/liability management process and related procedures. The ALCO meets on at least a quarterly basis and reviews asset/liability strategies, liquidity positions, alternative funding sources, interest rate risk measurement reports, capital levels and economic trends at both national and local levels. Our interest rate risk position is also monitored quarterly by the board of directors. 
 We manage our interest rate risk in an effort to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in market interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: originating loans with adjustable interest rates; promoting core deposit products; selling a portion of fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans; maintaining investments as available-for-sale; diversifying our loan portfolio; utilizing interest rate swaps; and strengthening our capital position. By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to changes in market interest rates. 
 Net Portfolio Value Simulation. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net portfolio value of equity NPV model. NPV represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio represents the dollar amount of our NPV divided by the present value of our total assets for a given interest rate scenario. NPV attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology, while the NPV ratio reflects that value as a form of capital ratio. We estimate what our NPV would be at a specific date. We then calculate what the NPV would be at the same date throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve. We currently calculate NPV under the assumptions that interest rates increase 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points from current market rates and that interest rates decrease 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points from current market rates.

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the way actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The above table assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the date indicated remains constant uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our NPV and will differ from actual results. 
 The percent changes to NPV in the +100, +200, +300 and +400 bp changes in interest rates was -10.3 , -22.3 , -34.5 and -47.2 , respectively, at September 30, 2024 versus policy limits of -10 , -20 , -30.0 and -40.0 , respectively. These percent changes were due primarily to the continued migration of deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from less interest-sensitive products such as NOW and demand deposits to products with greater interest rate sensitivity, i.e., money market and time deposits. The percent changes to NPV in the +200, +300 and +400 bp changes in interest rates was -21.5 , -32.5 and -43.3 , respectively, at December 31, 2023 versus policy limits of -20.0 , -30.0 and -40.0 , respectively. These percent changes were due primarily to the migration of deposits during 2023 from less interest-sensitive products such as NOW and demand deposits to products with greater interest rate sensitivity, i.e., money market and time deposits. We monitor our exposure to movements in interest rates regularly and discuss the implementation of strategies we believe will mitigate the negative impact of such movements. 
 51 

Economic Value of Equity. Like most financial institutions, our profitability depends to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet contracts, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, our results of operations depend largely on movements in market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to these movements. Factors such as inflation and instability in financial markets, among other factors beyond our control, may affect interest rates. 
 In a rising interest rate environment, we would expect that the rates on our deposits and borrowings would reprice upwards faster than the rates on our long-term loans and investments, which would be expected to compress our interest rate spread and have a negative effect on our profitability. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to make loan repayments on adjustable-rate loans, as the interest owed on such loans would increase as interest rates increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk as we may have to redeploy such loan or securities proceeds into lower-yielding assets, which might also negatively impact our income. If interest rates rise, we expect that our economic value of equity will decrease. Economic value of equity represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities. The Company s economic value of equity analysis as of September 30, 2024 estimated that, in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 22.3 decrease in economic value of equity versus the Board approved limit of 20.0 . At the same date, our analysis estimated that, in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, the Company would experience a 11.0 increase in the economic value of equity. 
 Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate real estate loans, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet or projected operating results. 
 52 

Item 4.	Controls and Procedures 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of September 30, 2024, the Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 for recording, processing, summarizing and reporting the information the Company is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 
 The effectiveness of a system of disclosure controls and procedures is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Due to such inherent limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting . During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 53 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1.	Legal Proceedings 
 Periodically, we are involved in claims and lawsuits, such as claims to enforce liens, condemnation proceedings on properties in which we hold security interests, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans and other issues incident to our business. At September 30, 2024, we were not a party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

On April 11, 2024, the board of directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 507,707 shares of common stock, representing approximately 10 of shares then outstanding, which became effective on May 14, 2024. The Company conducts repurchases through open market purchases, including by means of a trading plan adopted under SEC Rule 10b5-1, or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors. There is no guarantee as to the number of shares that the Company may ultimately repurchase. The program will expire 12 months after the effective date, regardless of whether all shares will have been repurchased. The Company may suspend or discontinue the program at any time. The Company holds repurchased shares in its treasury. 
 There were no sales of unregistered securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
