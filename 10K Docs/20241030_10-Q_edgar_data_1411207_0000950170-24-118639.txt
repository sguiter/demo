t have any L evel 3 financial assets or liabilities. 
 The Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value include cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative instruments, assets held in a rabbi trust and a deferred compensation obligation. The Company s cash equivalents consist of short-term U.S. government backed securities and time deposits. The Company's marketable securities consist of publicly traded stock of Jing-Jin Electric Technologies Co. Ltd., which has a readily determinable fair value. The Company s derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps. The Company s assets held in the rabbi trust consist principally of publicly available mutual funds and target date retirement funds. The Company s deferred compensation obligation is directly related to the fair value of assets held in the rabbi trust. The Company s valuation techniques used to calculate the fair value of cash equivalents, marketable securities, assets held in the rabbi trust and the deferred compensation obligation represent a market approach in active markets for identical assets that qualify as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company s valuation techniques used to calculate the fair value of derivative instruments represent a market approach with observable inputs that qualify as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company uses valuations from the issuing financial institutions for the fair value measurement of interest rate swaps. The floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), which is observable at commonly quoted intervals. The fair values are included in other current and non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. See "Note H. Derivatives for more information regarding the Company's interest rate swaps.

million. The fair value is based on quoted Level 2 market prices of the Company s debt as of September 30, 2024. The difference between the fair value and carrying value of the long-term debt is driven primarily by trends in the financial markets. Senior Secured Credit Facility In March 2024, the Company and ATI entered into Amendment No. 4 ("Amendment") to the Credit Agreement, after giving effect to a million principal prepayment, to remove the credit spread adjustment to the SOFR benchmark for all available interest periods and increase the commitments under the existing Revolving Credit Facility by million. The Amendment also extended the maturity date of the existing Term Loan from to and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility termination date from to . With the exception of the items noted above, the terms of the extended Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility are materially the same as they were prior to the Amendment. The Amendment was treated as a modification to the Senior Secured Credit Facility under GAAP. The Company recorded million as new deferred financing fees in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 and expensed million of prior deferred financing fees in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are collateralized by a lien on substantially all assets of the Company, ATI and certain existing and future U.S. subsidiary guarantors, as provided in the Credit Agreement. Interest on the Term Loan, as of September 30, 2024 , is either (a) over a SOFR rate on deposits in U.S. dollars for one-, three- or six-month periods (or a twelve-month period if, at the time of the borrowing, consented to by all relevant lenders and the administrative agent) ("Term SOFR"), or (b) over the greater of the prime lending rate as quoted by the administrative agent, the Term SOFR rate for an interest period of one month plus and the federal funds effective rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus , subject to a floor (the "Base Rate"). As of September 30, 2024, the Company elected to pay the lowest all-in rate of Term SOFR plus the applicable margin, or , on the Term Loan. The Credit Agreement requires minimum quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan, as well as prepayments from certain net cash proceeds of non-ordinary course asset sales and casualty and condemnation events, the incurrence of certain debt and from a percentage of excess cash flow, if applicable. The minimum required quarterly principal payment on the Term Loan through its maturity date of is million. As of September 30, 2024, there had been no payments required for certain net cash proceeds of non-ordinary course asset sales and casualty and condemnation events. The remaining principal balance is due upon maturity. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also provides a Revolving Credit Facility, net of an allowance for up to million in outstanding letters of credit commitments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company made withdrawals on the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million available under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of million in letters of credit. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable base rate plus an applicable margin based on the Company s first lien net leverage ratio. When the Company s first lien net leverage ratio is above x, interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is (a) over the Base Rate or (b) over the Term SOFR rate; when the Company s first lien net leverage ratio is equal to or less than x and above x, interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is (i) over the Base Rate or (ii) over the Term SOFR rate; and when the Company s first lien net leverage ratio is equal to or below x, interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is (y) over the Base Rate or (z) over the Term SOFR rate. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility was . In addition, there is an annual commitment fee, based on the Company s first lien net leverage ratio, on the average unused revolving credit borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Additionally, within the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, a first lien net leverage ratio at or below x results in the elimination of e xcess cash flow payments on the Senior Secured Credit Facility for the applicable year. In addition, the Credit Agreement, among other things, includes customary restrictions (subject to certain exceptions) on the Company s ability to incur certain indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, consolidations and mergers, declare or pay certain dividends or repurchase shares of the Company s common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. Senior Notes Each series of the Senior Notes is unsecured and is guaranteed by each of ATI s domestic subsidiaries that is a borrower under or guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facility and is unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by any of ATI s future domestic subsidiaries that are borrowers under or guarantee the Senior Secured Credit Facility. None of ATI s domestic subsidiaries currently guarantee its obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, and therefore none of ATI s domestic subsidiaries currently guarantee any series of the Senior Notes. The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain negative covenants restricting or limiting the Company s ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase the Company s capital stock, make certain investments, permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of the Company s subsidiaries, sell assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and consolidate or merge or sell all or substantially all of the Company s assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the indentures governing the Senior Notes. ATI may from time to time seek to retire its Senior Notes through cash purchases, exchanges for equity securities, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, contractual redemptions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and will be in accordance with the respective indenture governing such notes. The amounts involved may be material. Some or all of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes may be redeemed at any time at redemption prices specified in the indentures governing such notes. Prior to , ATI may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes by paying a price equal to of the principal amount being redeemed, plus an applicable premium .

The dilutive impact of stock-based compensation is calculated using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes that the Company uses the proceeds from the exercise of awards to repurchase common stock at the average market price during the period. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , there were outstanding stock options that were anti-dilutive. Basic and diluted EPS for the full-year are calculated using the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the year while quarterly basic and diluted EPS are calculated using the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the quarter; therefore, the sum of each quarter's EPS may not equal full-year EPS.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Fin ancial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our condensed consolidated interim financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The statements in this discussion regarding industry trends, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors below, and in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2024. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries Allison, the Company, we, us or our design and manufacture vehicle propulsion solutions, including commercial-duty on-highway, off-highway and defense fully automatic transmissions and electric hybrid and fully electric systems. The business was founded in 1915 and has been headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana since inception. Allison is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ALSN .

 Trends Impacting Our Business 
 In January 2024, the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America ("UAW") Local 933 ratified a new four-year collective bargaining agreement with us that expires in November 2027. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience a significant increase in labor costs under the terms of this new agreement. 
 In 2024, we expect higher net sales driven by price increases on certain products, increased North America On-Highway and Defense end market demand and the continued execution of growth initiatives.

North America On-Highway end market net sales were up 22 for the third quarter 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023, principally driven by strength in demand for Class 8 vocational vehicles and medium-duty trucks and price increases on certain products. 
 Global Off-Highway net sales were down 29 for the third quarter 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023, principally driven by lower demand from the energy sector in North America and the mining and construction sectors outside of North America, partially offset by strength in demand from the energy sector outside of North America. 
 Defense end market net sales were up 23 for the third quarter 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023, principally driven by increased demand for Tracked vehicle applications. 
 Outside North America On-Highway end market net sales were up 7 for the third quarter 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023, principally driven by higher demand in Asia and price increases on certain products, partially offset by lower demand in Europe.

Key Components of our Results of Operations 
 Net sales 
 We generate our net sales primarily from the sale of vehicle propulsion solutions, service and component parts, support equipment, defense kits, engineering services, royalties and extended transmission coverage to a wide array of original equipment manufacturers, distributors and the U.S. government. Sales are recorded in accordance with the terms of the contract, net of provisions for customer incentives and other rebates. Engineering services are recorded as net sales in accordance with the terms of the contract. The associated costs are recorded in cost of sales. We also have royalty agreements with third parties that provide net sales as a result of joint efforts in developing marketable products. 
 Cost of sales 
 Our primary components of cost of sales are purchased parts, the overhead expense related to our manufacturing operations and direct labor associated with the manufacture and assembly of vehicle propulsion solutions and parts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, direct material costs were approximately 65 , overhead costs were approximately 27 , and direct labor costs were approximately 8 of cost of sales. We are subject to changes in our cost of sales caused by movements in underlying commodity prices. We seek to hedge against this risk by using long-term agreements LTAs ), as appropriate. See Part I, Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Commodity Price Risk included below. 
 Selling, general and administrative 
 The principal components of our selling, general and administrative expenses are salaries and benefits for our office personnel, advertising and promotional expenses, product warranty expense, expenses relating to certain information technology systems and amortization of our intangible assets. 
 Engineering research and development 
 We incur costs in connection with research and development programs that are expected to contribute to future earnings. Such costs are expensed as incurred.

Table of Contents 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of net sales to measure our operating profitability. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of net sales provide management, investors and creditors with useful measures of the operational results of our business and increase the period-to-period comparability of our operating profitability and comparability with other companies. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of net sales is also used in the calculation of management s incentive compensation program. The most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of net sales is Net income and Net income as a percent of net sales, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest expense, net, income tax expense, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and other adjustments as defined by the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of March 29, 2019, as amended (the Credit Agreement ), governing Allison Transmission, Inc. s ATI ), our wholly-owned subsidiary, term loan facility in the amount of 515 million due March 2031 Term Loan and ATI s revolving credit facility with commitments in the amount of 750 million due March 2029 ("Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the Term Loan, the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"). Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of net sales is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. 
 We use Adjusted free cash flow to evaluate the amount of cash generated by our business that, after the capital investment needed to maintain and grow our business and certain mandatory debt service requirements, can be used for repayment of debt, stockholder distributions and strategic opportunities, including investing in our business. We believe that Adjusted free cash flow enhances the understanding of the cash flows of our business for management, investors and creditors. Adjusted free cash flow is also used in the calculation of management s incentive compensation program. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted free cash flow is Net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted free cash flow is calculated as Net cash provided by operating activities after additions of long-lived assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate cash primarily from our operations to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, working capital needs, debt service, dividends on common stock, stock repurchases and strategic growth initiatives, including investments, acquisitions and collaborations. Our ability to generate cash in the future and our future uses of cash are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control. We had total available cash and cash equivalents of 788 million and 555 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the available cash and cash equivalents, 200 million was deposited in operating accounts and 588 million was invested in U.S. government backed securities and time deposits as of September 30, 2024, compared to 134 million deposited in operating accounts and 421 million invested in U.S. government backed securities as of December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total of cash held by foreign subsidiaries was 70 million, the majority of which was at our subsidiaries located in China, Japan, India, Hungary and the Netherlands. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. As a result, we do not currently anticipate that local liquidity restrictions will preclude us from funding our targeted initiatives or operating needs with local resources. 
 We have not recognized any deferred tax liabilities associated with earnings in foreign subsidiaries, except for our subsidiary located in China, as they are intended to be permanently reinvested and used to support foreign operations or have no associated tax requirements. We have recorded a deferred tax liability of 3 million for the tax liability associated with the remittance of previously taxed income and unremitted earnings for our subsidiary located in China. The remaining deferred tax liabilities, if recorded, related to unremitted earnings that are indefinitely reinvested are not material. 
 Our liquidity requirements are significant, primarily due to our debt service requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we had 515 million of indebtedness associated with ATI s Term Loan, 400 million of indebtedness associated with ATI s 4.75 Senior Notes due October 2027 4.75 Senior Notes ), 500 million of indebtedness associated with ATI s 5.875 Senior Notes due June 2029 5.875 Senior Notes and 1,000 million of indebtedness associated with ATI s 3.75 Senior Notes due January 2031 3.75 Senior Notes and, together with the 4.75 Senior Notes and 5.875 Senior Notes, the Senior Notes ). Short-term and long-term debt service liquidity requirements consist of 1 million of minimum required quarterly principal payments on ATI s Term Loan through its maturity date of March 2031 and periodic interest payments on ATI s Term Loan and the Senior Notes. There are no required quarterly principal payments on the Senior Notes. Long-term debt service liquidity requirements also consist of the payment in full of any remaining principal balance of ATI s Term Loan and the Senior Notes upon their respective maturity dates. 
 We made 103 million and 5 million of principal payments on the Term Loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and growth initiatives will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility provides for a 750 million Revolving Credit Facility, net of an allowance for up to 75 million in outstanding letter of credit commitments. As of September 30, 2024, we had 745 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of 5 million in letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, we had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. If we have commitments outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility at the end of a fiscal quarter, the Senior Secured Credit Facility requires us to maintain a specified maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 5.50x. Additionally, within the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, a first lien net leverage ratio at or below 4.00x results in the elimination of excess cash flow payments on the Senior Secured Credit Facility for the applicable year. As of September 30, 2024, our first lien net leverage ratio was (0.23x). The Senior Secured Credit Facility also provides certain financial incentives based on our first lien net leverage ratio. A first lien net leverage ratio at or below 4.00x and above 3.50x results in a 25 basis point reduction to the applicable margin on the Revolving Credit Facility. A first lien net leverage ratio at or below 3.50x results in an additional 25 basis point reduction to the applicable margin on the Revolving Credit Facility. These reductions remain in effect as long as we achieve a first lien net leverage ratio at or below the related threshold. 
 In addition, the Credit Agreement includes, among other things, customary restrictions (subject to certain exceptions) on our ability to incur certain indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, consolidations and mergers, declare or pay certain dividends, and repurchase shares of our common stock. The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain negative covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, make certain investments, permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries, sell assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and consolidate or merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and indentures governing the Senior Notes. 
 Our credit ratings and outlook are reviewed periodically by Moody s Ratings Moody s and Fitch Ratings, Inc. Fitch ). As of September 30, 2024, our credit ratings from both Moody's and Fitch are shown in the table below:

Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 4,000 million of our common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program"). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 134 million of our common stock under the Repurchase Program. Substantially all of the repurchase transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were settled in cash during the same period. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 639 million available under the Repurchase Program.

Generally, cash provided by operating activities has been adequate to fund our operations. We have significant liquidity, including 788 million of cash and cash equivalents and 745 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of 5 million of letters of credit, as of September 30, 2024. At this time, we believe cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our known and anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months and thereafter. 
 Cash provided by operating activities 
 Operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 generated 590 million of cash compared to 546 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was principally driven by higher gross profit, lower cash income taxes and lower cash interest payments, partially offset by higher cash incentive compensation payments, higher operating working capital funding requirements and non-recurring UAW contract signing incentive payments. 
 Cash used for investing activities 
 Investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 used 70 million of cash compared to 71 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was principally driven by a 5 million decrease in capital expenditures, partially offset by a 4 million increase in equity method investments. 
 Cash used for financing activities 
 Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 used 287 million of cash compared to 205 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was principally driven by 98 million of increased payments on our long-term debt and 4 million of debt financing fees associated with the amendment of the Credit Agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility, partially offset by 24 million of lower stock repurchases under the Repurchase Program. 
 Contingencies 
 We are a party to various legal actions and administrative proceedings and subject to various claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including those relating to commercial transactions, product liability, personal injury and workers compensation, safety, health, taxes, environmental and other matters. For more information, see "Note P. Commitments and Contingencies of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates 
 A discussion of our critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates is included in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2024. The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of some assets and liabilities and, in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded in results of operations in the period that the events or circumstances giving rise to such changes occur. Within the context of these critical accounting estimates, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different policies or estimates being reported for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

ITEM 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Our exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates, foreign currency rate fluctuations and movements in commodity prices. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Our Senior Secured Credit Facility provides for variable rate borrowings of up to 1,260 million, including our 515 million Term Loan and 745 million under our Revolving Credit Facility, net of 5 million of letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, we held interest rate swap contracts that, in the aggregate, effectively hedge 500 million of the variable rate debt associated with the Term Loan at the forward-looking term rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate weighted average fixed rate of 2.81 through September 2025. A one-eighth percent increase or decrease in assumed interest rates for the Senior Secured Credit Facility, if fully drawn as of September 30, 2024, would have an impact of approximately 1 million on interest expense per year. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings against the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Exchange Rate Risk 
 While our net sales and costs are denominated primarily in U.S. Dollars, net sales, costs, assets and liabilities are generated in other currencies including Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan Renminbi, Euro, Hungarian Forint, Indian Rupee and Japanese Yen. The expansion of our business outside North America may further increase the risk that cash flows resulting from these activities may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. 
 Assuming current levels of foreign currency transactions, a 10 aggregate increase or decrease in the Chinese Yuan Renminbi, Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen would correspondingly change our earnings, net of tax, by an estimated 6 million per year. We believe our other direct exposure to foreign currencies is immaterial. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are subject to changes in our cost of sales caused by movements in underlying commodity prices. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 65 of our cost of sales consisted of purchased components. A substantial portion of the purchased parts are made of aluminum and steel. The cost of aluminum parts includes an adjustment factor on future purchases for fluctuations in aluminum prices based on accepted industry indices. In addition, a substantial amount of steel-based contracts also includes an index-based component. As our costs change, we are able to pass through a portion of the changes in commodity prices to certain of our customers according to our LTAs. We historically have not entered into long-term purchase contracts related to the purchase of aluminum and steel. 
 Assuming current levels of commodity purchases, a 10 variation in the price of aluminum and steel would correspondingly change our earnings by approximately 8 million and 13 million per year, respectively. 
 Many of our LTAs have incorporated a cost-sharing arrangement related to potential future commodity price fluctuations. For purposes of the sensitivity analysis above, the impact of these cost sharing arrangements has not been included.

ITEM 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
