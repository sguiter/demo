 common shares to the previously adopted Safety Insurance Group, Inc., 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Amended 2018 Plan enables the grant of stock awards, performance shares, cash-based performance units, other stock-based awards, stock options, stock appreciation rights, and stock unit awards, each of which may be granted separately or in tandem with other awards. Eligibility to participate includes officers, directors, employees and other individuals who provide bona fide services to the Company. The Amended 2018 Plan supersedes the Company s 2002 Management Omnibus Incentive Plan the 2002 Incentive Plan ). The Amended 2018 Plan establishes a pool of shares of common stock available for issuance to our employees and other eligible participants. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee intend to issue awards under the Amended 2018 Plan in the future. The maximum number of shares of common stock between both the Amended 2018 Plan and 2002 Incentive Plan with respect to which awards may be granted is . further grants will be allowed under the 2002 Incentive Plan. At September 30, 2024, there were shares available for future grant. Accounting and Reporting for Stock-Based Awards Accounting Standards Codification ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, requires the Company to measure and recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments. Under the provisions of ASC 718, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). Restricted Stock Service-based restricted stock awarded in the form of unvested shares is recorded at the market value of the Company s common stock on the grant date and amortized ratably as compensation expense over the requisite service period. Service-based restricted stock awards generally vest over a period and vest on the first and second anniversaries of the grant date and on the third anniversary of the grant date, except for non-executive employees restricted stock awards granted prior to 2018 which vest ratably over a service period and independent directors stock awards which vest immediately. Our independent directors are subject to stock ownership guidelines, which require them to have a value four times their annual cash retainer. In addition to service-based awards, the Company grants performance-based restricted shares to certain employees. These performance shares cliff vest after a performance period provided certain performance measures are attained. A portion of these awards, which contain a market condition, vest according to the level of total shareholder return achieved by the Company compared to its property-casualty insurance peers over a period. The remainder, which contain a performance condition, vest according to the level of Company s combined ratio results compared to a target based on its property-casualty insurance peers. Actual payouts can range from to of target shares awarded depending upon the level of achievement of the respective market and performance conditions during a three calendar-year performance period. Compensation expense for share awards with a performance condition is based on the probable number of awards expected to vest using the performance level most likely to be achieved at the end of the performance period. Performance-based awards with market conditions are accounted for and measured differently from awards that have a performance or service condition. The effect of a market condition is reflected in the award s fair value on the

Credit risk is a consequence of carrying, trading and investing in securities. To manage credit risk, the Company focuses on higher quality fixed income securities, reviews the credit strength of all companies in which it invests, limits its exposure in any one investment and monitors the portfolio quality, taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations.

These securities are included in fixed maturity securities on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Impairments For fixed maturities that the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the Company separates the expected credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors. The expected credit loss component is recognized as an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance is adjusted for any additional credit losses and subsequent recoveries, which are booked in income as either credit loss expense or credit loss benefit, respectively. Upon recognizing a credit loss, the cost basis is not adjusted. The impairment related to all other factors (non-credit factors) is reported in other comprehensive income. For fixed maturities where the Company records a credit loss, a determination is made as to the cause of the impairment and whether the Company expects a recovery in the value. For fixed maturities where the Company expects a recovery in value, the constant effective yield method is utilized, and the investment is amortized to par. For fixed maturity investments the Company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in credit loss expense. The new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the impairment recognized in credit loss expense. The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value. The Company uses a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below cost or amortized cost of our investments. Some of the factors considered in assessing impairment of fixed maturities due to credit losses include

 and , respectively, of unrealized losses were due to credit factors and were recorded as an allowance for expected credit losses expense. The Company concluded that outside of the securities that were recognized as credit impaired, the unrealized losses recorded on the fixed maturity portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 resulted from fluctuations in market interest rates and other temporary market conditions as opposed to fundamental changes in the credit quality of the issuers of such securities. Based upon the analysis performed, the Company s decision to hold these securities, the Company s current level of liquidity and our history of positive cash flows, management believes it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell any of its securities before the anticipated recovery in the fair value to its amortized cost basis. The following table represents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the allowance for expected credit losses on fixed maturities classified as available for sale.

All of the Company s holdings in mortgage-backed securities are either U.S. Government or Agency guaranteed or are rated investment grade by either Moody s or Standard Poor s. Net Investment Income The components of net investment income were as follows: Dividends on equity securities Equity in earnings of other invested assets Interest on other assets Total investment income Investment expenses Net investment income Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, provides a revised definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement disclosure requirements for fair value information. Under ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants (an exit price). ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources observable inputs and a reporting entity s internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or

On October 19, 2021, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (the SJC unanimously ruled that property and casualty insurers must compensate third-party claimants under property damage coverage, part 4 of the standard Massachusetts automobile insurance policy, 2008 edition (standard policy), for the inherent diminished value IDV that occurs when their vehicles are damaged in a crash. This ruling overturned a previous decision by the Massachusetts Superior Court (the Superior Court ), which found that a Massachusetts auto insurance policy did not provide property damage coverage for inherent diminished value damages for third-party claimants. The SJC placed the burden of proof on the individual claimant by explicitly specifying that the claimant must establish that the vehicle has suffered IDV damages and also the amount of IDV damages at issue. The SJC further ruled that an insurer s previous denial of coverage for such damages could not serve as the basis for a claim of unfair business practices. On June 20, 2023, the Superior Court denied a motion brought by the plaintiffs seeking class certification. The plaintiffs had filed a motion to amend the complaint, seeking to address the concerns raised by the Superior Court in denying their motion for class certification, which Safety had opposed. The motion was denied thus at this point, there will not be a renewed motion for class certification. As such, Safety has not accrued for a specific loss contingency.

Reinsurance We reinsure with other insurance companies a portion of our potential liability under the policies we have underwritten, thereby protecting us against an unexpectedly large loss or a catastrophic occurrence that could produce large losses, primarily in our homeowners line of business. We are selective in choosing our reinsurers, seeking only those companies that we consider to be financially stable and adequately capitalized. In an effort to minimize exposure to the insolvency of a reinsurer, we continually evaluate and review the financial condition of our reinsurers. Most of our reinsurers have an A.M. Best rating of A+ (Superior) or A (Excellent). We maintain reinsurance coverage to help lessen the effect of losses from catastrophic events, maintaining coverage during 2024 that protects us in the event of a "124-year storm" (that is, a storm of a severity expected to occur once in a 124-year period). We use various software products to measure our exposure to catastrophe losses and the probable maximum loss to us for catastrophe losses such as hurricanes. The models include estimates for our share of the catastrophe losses generated in the residual market for property insurance by the FAIR Plan. For 2024, we have purchased three layers of excess catastrophe reinsurance providing 615,000 of coverage for property losses in excess of 75,000 up to a maximum of 690,000. Our reinsurers co-participation is 80.0 of 75,000 for the 1st layer, 80.0 of 250,000 for the 2nd layer and 80.0 of 290,000 for the 3rd layer. We also have casualty excess of loss reinsurance for large casualty losses occurring in our automobile, homeowners, dwelling fire, and business owner lines of business in excess of 2,000 up to a maximum of 10,000. We have property excess of loss reinsurance coverage for large property losses, with coverage in excess of 2,500 up to a maximum of 25,000, for our homeowners, and business owners. In addition, we have liability excess of loss reinsurance for umbrella large losses in excess of 1,000 up to a maximum of 10,000. We also have various reinsurance agreements with Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company, of which the primary contract is a quota share agreement under which we cede 100 of the premiums and losses for the equipment breakdown coverage under our business owner policies and commercial package policies. We are a participant in CAR, a state-established body that runs the residual market reinsurance programs for commercial automobile insurance in Massachusetts under which premiums, expenses, losses and loss adjustment expenses on ceded business are shared by all insurers writing automobile insurance in Massachusetts. We also participate in the FAIR Plan in which premiums, expenses, losses and loss adjustment expenses on homeowners business that cannot be placed in the voluntary market are shared by all insurers writing homeowners insurance in Massachusetts. As a response to the exposure to catastrophe losses, on July 1, 2023, the FAIR Plan purchased 1,600,000 of catastrophe reinsurance for property losses with retention of 100,000.

 At September 30, 2024, we had a 142,531 recoverable from CAR, which comprises loss adjustment expense reserves, unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverable. Non-GAAP Measures Management has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in presenting the Company s results. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures better explain the Company s results of operations and allow for a more complete understanding of the underlying trends in the Company s business. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our definitions of these items may not be comparable to the definitions used by other companies. Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating income per diluted share consist of our GAAP net income adjusted by the net realized gains (losses) on investments, changes in net unrealized gains on equity securities, credit loss benefit (expense) and taxes related thereto. Net income and earnings per diluted share are the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating income per diluted share, respectively. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial measures to these non-GAAP measures is included in the financial highlights below.

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Written Premiums Direct 318,182 267,124 901,032 745,133 Assumed 5,122 7,472 22,885 23,230 Ceded (30,692) (23,509) (86,075) (69,423) Net written premiums 292,612 251,087 837,842 698,940 Earned Premiums Direct 282,916 231,249 800,708 654,085 Assumed 4,719 6,839 21,684 22,357 Ceded (28,978) (23,663) (80,738) (68,057) Net earned premiums 258,657 214,425 741,654 608,385 Net Investment Income. Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1,795, or 12.8 , to 12,210 from 14,005 for the comparable 2023 period. Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 554, or 1.3 , to 40,941 from 41,495 for the comparable 2023 period. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable 2023 period is due to the earned interest from our higher yield bonds and variable rate secured and senior bank loans. Net effective annualized yield on the investment portfolio was 3.4 for the three months September 30, 2024 compared to 4.0 for the comparable 2023 period. Net effective annualized yield on the investment portfolio was 3.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The investment portfolio s duration on fixed maturities was 3.4 years at September 30, 2024 compared to 3.6 years at December 31, 2023. Earnings from Partnership Investments. Earnings from partnership investments were 4,345 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,427 for the comparable 2023 period. Earnings from partnership investments were 8,597 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5,146 for the comparable 2023 period. The nine months 2024 earnings reflect an increase in investment appreciation and timing of cash proceeds received compared to the prior year. Timing and generation of these returns on capital can vary based on the results and transactions of the underlying partnerships. Net Realized Gains on Investments. Net realized gains on investments was 1,314 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 270 for the comparable 2023 period. Net realized gains on investments was 4,521 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,111 for the comparable 2023 period. The increase in net realized gains is driven primarily by the sale of equity securities in a gain position.

 The following table illustrates the gross unrealized losses included in our investment portfolio and the fair value of those securities, aggregated by investment category. The table also illustrates the length of time that they have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or More Total Estimated Unrealized Estimated Unrealized Estimated Unrealized Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses U.S. Treasury securities 1,750 70 1,750 70 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 647 28 19,683 1,847 20,330 1,875 Residential mortgage-backed securities 5,558 125 175,230 17,312 180,788 17,437 Commercial mortgage-backed securities 126,289 9,510 126,289 9,510 Other asset-backed securities 6,857 161 23,019 1,521 29,876 1,682 Corporate and other securities 64,528 290 315,184 20,638 379,712 20,928 Subtotal, fixed maturity securities 77,590 604 661,155 50,898 738,745 51,502 Equity securities 15,442 969 23,235 3,634 38,677 4,603 Total temporarily impaired securities 93,032 1,573 684,390 54,532 777,422 56,105 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that 1,545 and 1,208, respectively, of unrealized losses were due to credit factors and were recorded as an allowance for expected credit losses expense. The Company concluded that outside of the securities that were recognized as credit impaired, the unrealized losses recorded on the fixed maturity portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 resulted from fluctuations in market interest rates and other temporary market conditions as opposed to fundamental changes in the credit quality of the issuers of such securities. Based upon the analysis performed, the Company s decision to hold these securities, the Company s current level of liquidity and our history of positive cash flows, management believes it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell any of its securities before the anticipated recovery in the fair value to its amortized cost basis. Specific qualitative analysis was also performed for securities appearing on our Watch List, if any. Qualitative analysis considered such factors as the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer, whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and the historical volatility of the fair value of the security. For information regarding fair value measurements of our investment portfolio, refer to Item 1-Financial Statements, Note 5, Investments, of this Form 10-Q. Commission Income: Commission income includes revenues from new and renewal commissions paid by insurance carriers, which we recognize when earned. Commission income was 1,963 and 1,918 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Commission income was 5,798 and 5,159 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Finance and Other Service Income. Finance and other service income includes revenues from premium installment charges, which we recognize when earned, and other miscellaneous income and fees. Finance and other service income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1,159, or 22.8 , to 6,253 from 5,094 for the comparable 2023 period. Finance and other service income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 3,278, or 23.5 , to 17,244 from 13,966 for the comparable 2023 period. The increase is primarily driven by the increase in policy counts and changes to our fee assessment policies. Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 22,968, or 14.4 , to 182,489 from 159,521 for the comparable 2023 period. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 53,433, or 11.4 , to 523,630 from 470,197 for the comparable 2023 period.

 Our GAAP loss ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 70.6 from 74.4 for the comparable 2023 period. Our GAAP loss ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 70.6 from 77.3 for the comparable 2023 period. Our GAAP loss ratio excluding loss adjustment expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 62.7 compared to 65.7 for the comparable 2023 period. Our GAAP loss ratio excluding loss adjustment expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 61.8 compared to 67.8 for the comparable 2023 period. Total prior year favorable development included in the pre-tax results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 8,563 compared to 13,476 for the comparable 2023 period. Total prior year favorable development included in the pre-tax results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 38,938 compared to 34,997 for the comparable 2023 period. The increase in prior year favorable development in 2024 is primarily related to the FAIR Plan Development. Underwriting, Operating and Related Expenses. Underwriting, operating and related expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 12,651, or 19.4 , to 77,868 from 65,217 for the comparable 2023 period. Underwriting, operating and related expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 36,224, or 19.3 , to 224,056 from 187,832 for the comparable 2023 period. The increase in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is driven by an increase in base commissions resulting from the increase in written premiums. Our GAAP expense ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 30.1 from 30.4 for the comparable 2023 period. Our GAAP expense ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 30.2 from 30.9 for the comparable 2023 period. Interest Expense. Interest expense was 124 and 139 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense was 385 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 697 for the comparable 2023 period. The credit facility commitment fee included in interest expense was 45 and 37 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate was 21.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The effective tax rate was 21.5 and 23.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2024 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the effects of stock-based compensation and permanent differences regarding executive compensation. Net Income. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 25,889 compared to net income of 1,949 for the comparable 2023 period. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 62,603 compared to 6,613 for the comparable 2023 period. Non-GAAP Operating Income . Non-GAAP operating income, as defined above, was 16,524 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8,673 for the comparable 2023 period. Non-GAAP operating income was 47,542 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7,870 for the comparable 2023 period. Liquidity and Capital Resources As a holding company, Safety s assets consist primarily of the stock of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Our principal source of funds to meet our obligations and pay dividends to shareholders, therefore, is dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries, principally Safety Insurance. Safety is the borrower under our credit facility. Safety Insurance s sources of funds primarily include premiums received, investment income, and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments. Safety Insurance s principal uses of cash are the payment of claims, operating expenses and taxes, the purchase of investments, and the payment of dividends to Safety. Net cash provided by operating activities was 78,269 and 17,063 during the nine months ended 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our operations typically generate positive cash flows from operations as most premiums are received in advance of the time when claim and benefit payments are required. Positive operating cash flows are expected in the future to meet our liquidity requirements.

 Net cash used for investing activities was 13,730 and net cash provided by invested activities was 38,883 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Fixed maturities, equity securities, short-term investments and other invested assets purchased were 237,338 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 108,003 for the comparable prior year period. Proceeds from maturities, redemptions, calls and sales, of securities were 229,884 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 148,288 for the comparable prior year period. Net cash used for financing activities was 40,093 and 50,352 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used for financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of dividend payments to shareholders. The Insurance Subsidiaries maintain a high degree of liquidity within their respective investment portfolios in fixed maturity and equity securities. We do not anticipate the need to sell these securities to meet the Insurance Subsidiaries cash requirements. We expect the Insurance Subsidiaries to generate sufficient operating cash to meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. However, there can be no assurance that unforeseen business needs or other items will not occur causing us to have to sell securities before their values fully recover; thereby causing us to recognize additional impairment charges in that time period. Credit Facility For information regarding our Credit Facility, please refer to Item 1- Financial Statements, Note 9, Debt, of this Form 10-Q. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There are no recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the Company. Regulatory Matters Our Insurance Subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid to their parent without prior approval of the Commissioner of the Division of Insurance of Massachusetts (the Commissioner ). The Massachusetts statute limits the dividends an insurer may pay in any twelve-month period, without the prior permission of the Commissioner, to the greater of (i) 10 of the insurer s surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) the insurer s net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. Our insurance company subsidiaries may not declare an extraordinary dividend (defined as any dividend or distribution that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the limits established by Massachusetts statute) until thirty days after the Commissioner has received notice of the intended dividend and has not objected. As historically administered by the Commissioner, this provision requires the Commissioner s prior approval of an extraordinary dividend. Under Massachusetts law, an insurer may pay cash dividends only from its unassigned funds, also known as earned surplus, and the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. At December 31, 2023, the statutory surplus of Safety Insurance was 744,904, and its statutory net income for 2023 was 4,022. As a result, a maximum of 74,490 is available in 2024 for such dividends without prior approval of the Commissioner. As a result of this Massachusetts statute, the Insurance Subsidiaries had restricted net assets in the amount of 670,414 at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Safety Insurance paid dividends to Safety of 38,828. The maximum dividend permitted by law is not indicative of an insurer s actual ability to pay dividends, which may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, which could affect an insurer s ratings or competitive position, the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends.

 Since the initial public offering of its common stock in November 2002, the Company has paid regular quarterly dividends to shareholders of its common stock. Quarterly dividends paid during 2024 were as follows: 

Total Declaration Record Payment Dividend per Dividends Paid Date Date Date Common Share and Accrued February 15, 2024 March 1, 2024 March 15, 2024 0.90 13,280 May 8, 2024 June 1, 2024 June 15, 2024 0.90 13,308 August 7, 2024 September 3, 2024 September 13, 2024 0.90 13,314 On November 5, 2024, our Board approved and declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.90 per share which will be paid on December 13, 2024 to shareholders of record on December 2, 2024. We plan to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends, depending on our financial position and the regularity of our cash flows. On February 23, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to 50,000 of the Company s outstanding common shares. As of September 30, 2024, the Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized increases to the existing share repurchase program of up to 200,000 of its outstanding common shares. Under the program, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock for cash in public or private transactions, in the open market or otherwise. The timing of such repurchases and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, market conditions and applicable regulatory and corporate requirements. The program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. No shares were purchased by the Company during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company purchased 74,213 shares at a cost of 5,240 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had purchased 3,215,690 shares of common stock at a cost of 155,240. Management believes that the current level of cash flow from operations provides us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs over the next 12 months. We expect to be able to continue to meet our operating needs after the next 12 months from internally generated funds. Since our ability to meet our obligations in the long term (beyond such twelve-month period) is dependent upon such factors as market changes, insurance regulatory changes and economic conditions, no assurance can be given that the available net cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating needs. We expect that we would need to borrow or issue capital stock if we needed additional funds, for example, to pay for an acquisition or a significant expansion of our operations. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds for any of the foregoing purposes would be available to us at such time. Risk-Based Capital Requirements The NAIC has adopted a formula and model law to implement risk-based capital requirements for most property and casualty insurance companies, which are designed to determine minimum capital requirements and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations. Under Massachusetts law, insurers having less total adjusted capital than that required by the risk-based capital calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. The risk-based capital law provides for four levels of regulatory action. The extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the level of total adjusted capital to risk-based capital falls. As of December 31, 2023, the Insurance Subsidiaries had total capital of 744,904, which is in excess of amounts requiring company or regulatory action at any prescribed risk-based capital action level. Minimum statutory capital and surplus, or company action level risk-based capital, was 231,882 at December 31, 2023.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no material obligations under a guarantee contract meeting the characteristics identified in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 460, Guarantees. We have no material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. We have no material obligations, including contingent obligations, under contracts that would be accounted for as derivative instruments. We have no obligations, including contingent obligations, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity held by, and material to, us, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. We have no direct investments in real estate and no holdings of mortgages secured by commercial real estate. Accordingly, we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves Significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting to us of that loss and our final payment of that loss. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities. Our reserves represent estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and estimated losses incurred but not yet reported IBNR and the expenses of investigating and paying those losses, or loss adjustment expenses. Every quarter, we review our previously established reserves and adjust them, if necessary. When a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment. The amount of the reserve is primarily based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved, the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss. The estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims person. During the loss adjustment period, these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the cases. When a claim is closed with or without a payment, the difference between the case reserve and the settlement amount creates a reserve deficiency if the payment exceeds the case reserve or a reserve redundancy if the payment is less than the case reserve. In accordance with industry practice, we also maintain reserves for IBNR. IBNR reserves are determined in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial reserving techniques on the basis of our historical information and experience. We review and make adjustments to incurred but not yet reported reserves quarterly. In addition, IBNR reserves can also be expressed as the total loss reserves required less the case reserves on reported claims. When reviewing reserves, we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors, such as our historical loss experience and that of the industry, trends in claims frequency and severity, our mix of business, our claims processing procedures, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in imposition of damages, and changes and trends in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. A change in any of these factors from the assumption implicit in our estimate can cause our actual loss experience to be better or worse than our reserves, and the difference can be material. There is no precise method, however, for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves, because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors.

 In estimating all our loss reserves, we follow the guidance prescribed by ASC 944, Financial Services Insurance. Management determines our loss and LAE reserves estimate based upon the analysis of our actuaries. A reasonable estimate is derived by selecting a point estimate within a range of indications as calculated by our actuaries using generally accepted actuarial techniques. The key assumption in most actuarial analysis is that past patterns of frequency and severity will repeat in the future, unless a significant change in the factors described above takes place. Our key factors and resulting assumptions are the ultimate frequency and severity of claims, based upon the most recent ten years of claims reported to the Company, and the data CAR reports to us to calculate our share of the residual market, as of the date of the applicable balance sheet. For each accident year and each coverage within a line of business our actuaries calculate the ultimate losses incurred. Our total reserves are the difference between the ultimate losses incurred and the cumulative loss and loss adjustment payments made to date. Our IBNR reserves are calculated as the difference between our total reserves and the outstanding case reserves at the end of the accounting period. To determine ultimate losses, our actuaries calculate a range of indications and select a point estimation using such actuarial techniques as: Paid Loss Indications: This method projects ultimate loss estimates based upon extrapolations of historic paid loss trends. This method tends to be used on short tail lines such as automobile physical damage. Incurred Loss Indications: This method projects ultimate loss estimates based upon extrapolations of historic incurred loss trends. This method tends to be used on long tail lines of business such as automobile liability and homeowner s liability. Bornhuetter-Ferguson Indications: This method projects ultimate loss estimates based upon extrapolations of an expected amount of IBNR, which is added to current incurred losses or paid losses. This method tends to be used on small, immature, or volatile lines of business, such as our BOP and umbrella lines of business. Bodily Injury Code Indications: This method projects ultimate loss estimates for our private passenger and commercial automobile bodily injury coverage based upon extrapolations of the historic number of accidents and the historic number of bodily injury claims per accident. Projected ultimate bodily injury claims are then segregated into expected claims by type of injury (e.g. soft tissue injury vs. hard tissue injury) based on past experience. An ultimate severity, or average paid loss amounts, is estimated based upon extrapolating historic trends. Projected ultimate loss estimates using this method are the aggregate of estimated losses by injury type. Such techniques assume that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting our ultimate losses, total reserves, and resulting IBNR reserves. It is possible that the final outcome may fall above or below these amounts as a result of a number of factors, including immature data, sparse data, or significant growth in a line of business. Using these methodologies our actuaries established a range of reasonably possible estimations for net reserves of approximately 474,609 to 540,008 as of September 30, 2024. In general, the low and high values of the ranges represent reasonable minimum and maximum values of the indications based on the techniques described above. Our selected point estimate of net loss and LAE reserves based upon the analysis of our actuaries was 512,579 as of September 30, 2024. The following table presents the point estimation of the recorded reserves and the range of estimations by line of business for net loss and LAE reserves as of September 30, 2024.

Our IBNR reserves consist of our estimate of the total loss reserves required less our case reserves. The IBNR reserves for CAR assumed commercial automobile business are 38.6 of our total reserves for CAR assumed commercial automobile business as of September 30, 2024, due to the reporting delays in the information we receive from CAR, as described further in the section on Residual Market Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves. The following table presents information by line of business for our total net reserves and the corresponding retained (i.e. direct less ceded) reserves and assumed reserves as of September 30, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024 Line of Business Retained Assumed Net Private passenger automobile 240,296 CAR assumed private passenger automobile 9 Net private passenger automobile 240,305 Commercial automobile 78,052 CAR assumed commercial automobile 33,399 Net commercial automobile 111,451 Homeowners 94,628 FAIR Plan assumed homeowners Net homeowners 94,628 All other 66,194 66,194 Total net reserves for losses and LAE 479,170 33,408 512,579 Residual Market Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves We are a participant in CAR and other various residual markets and assume a portion of losses and LAE on business ceded by the industry participants to the residual markets. We were a participant in FAIR Plan until the recent FAIR Plan Restructuring. We estimate reserves for assumed losses and LAE that have not yet been reported to us by the residual markets. Our estimations are based upon the same factors we use for our own reserves, plus additional factors due to the nature of and the information we receive. Residual market deficits and gains, consists of premium ceded to the various residual markets less losses and LAE, and is allocated among insurance companies based on a various formulas (the Participation Ratio that takes into consideration a company s voluntary market share. Because of the lag in the various residual market estimations, and in order to try to validate to the extent possible the information provided, we must try to estimate the effects of the actions of our competitors in order to establish our Participation Ratio.

 Although we rely to a significant extent in setting our reserves on the information the various residual markets provide, we are cautious in our use of that information, because of the delays in receiving data from the various residual markets. As a result, we have to estimate our Participation Ratio and these reserves are subject to significant judgments and estimates. Sensitivity Analysis Establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process. There can be no certainty that currently established reserves based on our key assumptions regarding frequency and severity in our lines of business, or our assumptions regarding our share of the CAR loss will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience. To the extent that reserves are inadequate and are strengthened, the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to earnings in the period that the deficiency is recognized. To the extent that reserves are redundant and are released, the amount of the release is a credit to earnings in the period the redundancy is recognized. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 1 percentage-point change in the loss and LAE ratio would result in a change in reserves of 7,417. Each 1 percentage-point change in the loss and loss expense ratio would have had a 5,859 effect on net income, or 0.40 per diluted share. Our assumptions consider that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, are an appropriate basis for establishing our reserves. Our individual key assumptions could each have a reasonable possible range of plus or minus 5 percentage-points for each estimation, although there is no guarantee that our assumptions will not have more than a 5 percentage point variation. The following sensitivity tables present information for each of our primary lines of business on the effect each 1 percentage-point change in each of our key assumptions on unpaid frequency and severity could have on our retained (i.e., direct minus ceded) loss and LAE reserves and net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In evaluating the information in the table, it should be noted that a 1 percentage-point change in a single assumption would change estimated reserves by 1 percentage-point. A 1 percentage-point change in both our key assumptions would change estimated reserves within a range of plus or minus 2 percentage-points.

Our assumptions consider that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for establishing our CAR reserves. Each of our assumptions could have a reasonably possible range of plus or minus 5 percentage-points for each estimation.

 The following sensitivity table presents information of the effect each 1 percentage-point change in our assumptions on our share of reserves for CAR and other residual markets could have on our assumed loss and LAE reserves and net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In evaluating the information in the table, it should be noted that a 1 percentage-point change in our assumptions would change estimated reserves by 1 percentage-point.

Our prior year reserves decreased by 38,938 and 34,997 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table presents a comparison of prior year development of our net reserves for losses and LAE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Each accident year represents all claims for an annual accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid. Our financial statements reflect the aggregate results of the current and all prior accident years.

The 2024 decrease is composed of reductions of 5,256 in our private passenger automobile reserves, 4,937 in our commercial automobile reserves, 14,681 in our homeowners reserves, which includes 8,644 of FAIR Plan Development, and 14,064 in our other lines reserves. The 2023 decrease is primarily composed of reductions of 8,028 in our private passenger automobile reserves, 5,898 in our commercial automobile reserves, 9,070 in our homeowners reserves and 12,001 in our other lines reserves.

Our retained other than auto and homeowners lines of business prior year reserves decreased, due primarily to fewer claims than previously estimated. For further information, see Results of Operations: Losses and Loss Adjustment Expense s. Investment Impairments The Company uses a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below cost or amortized cost of our investments. Some of the factors considered in assessing impairment of fixed maturities due to credit losses include the extent to which the fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition of and the near and long-term prospects of the issuer, whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, the historical volatility of the fair value of the security and whether it is more like than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value. This methodology ensures that we evaluate available evidence concerning any declines in a disciplined manner. For fixed maturities that the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the Company separates the expected credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors. The expected credit loss component is recognized as an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance is adjusted for any additional credit losses and subsequent recoveries, which are booked in income as either credit loss expense or credit loss benefit, respectively. Upon recognizing a credit loss, the cost basis is not adjusted. The impairment related to all other factors (non-credit factors) is reported in other comprehensive income. For further information, see Results of Operations . Forward-Looking Statements Forward-looking statements might include one or more of the following, among others: Projections of revenues, income, earnings per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items; Descriptions of plans or objectives of management for future operations, products or services; Forecasts of future economic performance, liquidity, need for funding and income; Legal and regulatory commentary Descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing; and Future performance of credit markets.

 Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, plan, estimate, aim, projects, or words of similar meaning and expressions that indicate future events and trends, or future or conditional verbs such as will, would, should, could, or may. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the Company s strategy for growth, product development, market position, expenditures and financial results, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual future conditions, events, results or trends to differ significantly and/or materially from historical results or those projected in the forward-looking statements. These factors include but are not limited to: The competitive nature of our industry and the possible adverse effects of such competition; Conditions for business operations and restrictive regulations in Massachusetts; The possibility of losses due to claims resulting from severe weather; The impact of inflation and supply chain delays on loss severity; The possibility that the Commissioner may approve future rule changes that change the operation of the residual market; The possibility that existing insurance-related laws and regulations will become further restrictive in the future; The impact of investment, economic and underwriting market conditions, including interest rates and inflation; Our possible need for and availability of additional financing, and our dependence on strategic relationships, among others; and Other risks and factors identified from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC. Refer to Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Some other factors, such as market, operational, liquidity, interest rate, equity and other risks, are described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Factors relating to the regulation and supervision of our Company are also described or incorporated in this report. There are other factors besides those described or incorporated in this report that could cause actual conditions, events or results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. We do not undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk (Dollars in thousands) Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. We have exposure to market risk through our investment activities and our financing activities. Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates. We use both fixed and variable rate debt as sources of financing. We have not entered, and do not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. Our exposure to interest rate changes primarily results from our significant holdings of fixed rate investments and from our financing activities. Our fixed maturity investments include U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, obligations of state and local governments and governmental authorities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, most of which are exposed to changes in prevailing interest rates. We manage our exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations through active review of our investment portfolio by our management and Board of Directors and consultation with third-party financial advisors. As a general matter, we do not attempt to match the durations of our assets with the durations of our liabilities, and the 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 majority of our liabilities are short tail . Our goal is to maximize the total after-tax return on all of our investments. An important strategy that we employ to achieve this goal is to try to hold enough in cash and short-term investments in order to avoid liquidating longer-term investments to pay claims. Based upon the results of interest rate sensitivity analysis, the following table shows the interest rate risk of our investments in fixed maturities, measured in terms of fair value (which is equal to the carrying value for all our fixed maturity securities). 

-100 Basis +100 Basis Point Change No Change Point Change As of September 30, 2024 Estimated fair value 1,140,148 1,098,984 1,057,913 Estimated increase (decrease) in fair value 41,164 (41,071) With respect to floating rate debt, we are exposed to the effects of changes in prevailing interest rates. At September 30, 2024, we had no debt outstanding under our credit facility. Assuming the full utilization of our current available credit facility, a 2.0 increase in the prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt would result in interest expense increasing approximately 600 for 2024, assuming that all of such debt is outstanding for the entire year. In addition, in the current market environment, our investments can also contain liquidity risks. Equity Risk. Equity risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices. Our exposure to changes in equity prices results from our holdings of common stock and mutual funds held to fund the executive deferred compensation plan. We continuously evaluate market conditions and we expect in the future to purchase additional equity securities. We principally manage equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures [as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )] as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are adequate and effective and ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Risk Factors There have been no subsequent material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds (Dollars in thousands) On February 23, 2022, the Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase of up to 50,000 of the Company s outstanding common shares. The Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized increases to the existing share repurchase program of up to 200,000 of its outstanding common shares. Under the program, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock for cash in public or private transactions, in the open market or otherwise. The timing of such repurchases and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, market conditions and applicable regulatory and corporate requirements. The program does not require the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and it may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. No shares were repurchased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.
