Critical Accounting Estimates 

We prepare our condensed consolidated financial
statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.
Our actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 

20 

There have been no material changes to our critical
accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting estimates discussed in the Form 10-K.

financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards. 

Results of Operations 

Three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2023 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we recognized approximately 4.0 million and 1.0 million in revenue from operations, respectively, primarily driven by the
commissions and underwriting revenue earned by Dominari Securities and Dominari Manager LLC Manager ). During the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred a loss from operations of approximately 3.2 million and 3.1 million, respectively. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, other expenses was approximately 1.0 million and 0.4 million, respectively. 

The activity described above for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, is primarily a result of the Company s entrance into the financial services industry, overall
volatility in investment valuations due to macroeconomic uncertainty impacting marketable securities and the change in carrying value
of long-term equity investments. Specifically: 

i. 
 Marketable securities - we recognized a realized gain of approximately 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We also recognized an unrealized loss of approximately 0.4 million and dividend income of 78,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.The increase of approximately 1.2 million in realized gains over the three months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by both market improvement and an increase in sale activity resulting in more realized gains. 

ii. 
 Notes receivable - we recognized 0.4 million realized and unrealized loss over the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus no gain or loss during the three months ended September 30, 2023 on notes receivable. 

iii. 
 Long-term equity investments - changes over the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are a function of observable market transactions which resulted in a decrease of approximately 1.0 million on the adjusted carrying value of the investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which is an increase of approximately 0.5 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we recognized approximately 11.6 million and 1.0 million in revenue from operations, respectively, primarily driven by the commissions
and underwriting revenue earned by Dominari Securities and Manager. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred
a loss from operations of approximately 8.7 million and 16.0 million, respectively. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, other expenses was approximately 7.0 million and 17,000, respectively. 

The activity described above for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, is primarily a result of the Company s entrance into the financial services industry, overall
volatility in investment valuations due to macroeconomic uncertainty impacting marketable securities and the change in carrying value
of long-term equity investments. Specifically: 

i. 
 Marketable securities - we recognized a realized gain of approximately 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recognized an unrealized loss of 3.4 million and dividend income of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase of approximately 5.0 million in realized gains over the nine months ended September 2023 was driven by both market improvement and an increase in sale activity resulting in more realized gains. 

ii. 
 Notes receivable - the changes over the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 which resulted in an increase in net realized and unrealized loss of approximately 1.9 million on the adjusted fair value of our notes receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was largely driven by the adjustment to the fair value from the direct write off of the note receivable from Raefan Industries LLC. 

iii. 
 Long-term equity investments -the changes over the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are a function of observable market transactions which resulted in a decrease of approximately 6.4 million on the adjusted carrying value of the investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 6.0 million greater than that of the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We continue to incur ongoing administrative and
other expenses, including public company expenses. While we continue to implement our business strategy, we intend to finance our activities
through: 

managing current cash and cash equivalents on hand from our past debt and equity offerings; 

seeking additional funds raised through the sale of additional securities in the future; and 

seeking additional liquidity through credit facilities or other debt arrangements. 

Our ultimate success is dependent on our ability
to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis. Our business may require significant amounts of capital to
sustain operations that we need to execute our longer-term business plan to support our transition into the financial services industry.
Our working capital amounted to approximately 22.3 million as of September 30, 2024. We believe our cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities, together with the anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure
requirements for at least the next 12 months. In the event that cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our operations, as
expected, or if our plans or assumptions change, including if inflation begins to have a greater impact on our business or if we decide
to move forward with any activities that require more outlays of cash than originally planned, we may need to raise additional capital
sooner than expected. We may raise this additional capital by obtaining additional debt or equity financing, especially if we experience
downturns in our business that are more severe or longer than anticipated, or if we experience significant increases in expense levels
resulting from being a publicly traded company or from continuing operations. 

Our ability to obtain capital to implement our
growth strategy over the longer term will depend on our future operating performance, financial condition and, more broadly, on the availability
of equity and debt financing. Capital availability will be affected by prevailing conditions in our industry, the global economy, the
global financial markets, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Specifically, as a result of recent volatility and
weakness in the public markets, due to, among other factors, uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets, it may be much more
difficult to raise additional capital, if and when it is needed, unless the public markets become less volatile and stronger at such time
that we seek to raise additional capital. In addition, any additional debt service requirements we take on could be based on higher interest
rates and shorter maturities and could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance
of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to stockholders. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, net cash used in operations was approximately 11.9 million and 17.5 million, respectively. The cash used in operating activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily attributable to a net loss of approximately 15.8 million, 3.8 million realized
gain on marketable securities and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 5.7 million, of which 6.5 million is clearing broker
deposits, partially offset by approximately 6.4 million of change in carrying value of long-term equity investment, 3.4 million unrealized
loss on marketable securities and 2 million unrealized and realized loss on note receivable. The cash used in operating activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily attributable to a net loss of approximately 16 million, approximately 1.2 million
of realized loss on marketable securities and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 4.4 million, partially offset by 1.4 million
stock-based compensation expense and approximately 0.9 million in unrealized gain on marketable securities. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was approximately 12.5 million and (10.4) million, respectively. The cash
provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily resulted from our sales of marketable securities
of approximately 14.8 million and the sale of a short-term investments of 3.5 million, partially offset by purchase of marketable securities
of 4.0 million and funds to employee loans of 2.4 million. The cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, primarily resulted from our purchase of marketable securities of approximately 34.1 million and the acquisition of FPS of approximately
 1.1 million, partially offset by our sale of marketable securities approximately of 24.6 million. The Company also collected approximately
 0.8 million in principal related to its short-term notes. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
there are no cash flows from financing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was
approximately 0.9 million, which reflects the cost for purchase of treasury stock of approximately 0.9 million.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

Not Applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act. Based upon that evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal controls. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonably possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Material Weaknesses in Internal Controls 

The Company s management has concluded that
our controls around the accounting for certain notes receivable accounted for at fair value and certain long-term investments accounted
for at fair value or with the equity security measurement alternative was not effectively designed or maintained, and therefore initially
were not accounted for correctly. As a result, our management performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial
statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management understands
that the accounting standards applicable to our financial statements are complex and will seek to enhance internal controls over financial
reporting and engage experienced third-party professionals with whom management can consult with respect to accounting matters and remediate
this material weakness. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In response to the material weakness identified
above, the Company has implemented changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company is actively increasing the quantity and quality of our
internal accounting personnel and has engaged external valuation specialists and accounting advisors with financial reporting expertise,
so as to provide the Company with resources sufficient to properly design and implement internal controls which will prevent and detect
material misstatements to the financial statements in a timely manner. In addition, the Company has implemented a multi-layered process
to establish and review the valuation of long-term investments with such outside specialists discussed above. 

As a result of these changes, the Company believes
the material weakness described above will be remediated. However, due to the nature of the material weakness, it will not be considered
remediated until the controls have been applied for a sufficient amount of time and management has performed testing of the controls to
conclude that the controls are operating effectively. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our management does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

Part II - Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

Many aspects of the Company s business involve
substantial risks of liability. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may be named as defendant or co-defendant in various legal
actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, which could create substantial exposure and periodic expenses. The
Company may also be involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental
and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Company s business, which may result in expenses, adverse judgments, settlements, fines,
penalties, injunctions or other relief. In the past in the ordinary course of business, the Company has actively pursued legal remedies
to enforce its intellectual property rights and to stop unauthorized use of its technology. 

In March 2024, the Company received a notice of
petition of a filed action seeking relief related to the hiring in March 2024 of new registered representatives from the representatives 
former employer. This notice was filed against the Company s subsidiary Dominari Securities. The Company does not agree with the
claim of the plaintiff and will defend itself accordingly. While the Company intends to defend itself vigorously from this claim, it is
unable to predict the outcome of such legal proceeding. Any potential loss as a result of this legal proceeding cannot be reasonably estimated.
As a result, the Company has not recorded a loss contingency for the aforementioned claim. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

As a smaller reporting company as
defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item. Our current risk factors are set
forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. Any of our previously disclosed risk factors could
result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently
known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such
risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.
