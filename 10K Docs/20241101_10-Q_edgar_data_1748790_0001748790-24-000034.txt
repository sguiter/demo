 Unless otherwise indicated, references to "Amcor," the "Company," "we," "our," and "us" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to Amcor plc and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain statements that are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are generally identified with words like "believe," "expect," "target," "project," "may," "could," "would," "approximately," "possible," "will," "should," "intend," "plan," "anticipate," "commit," "estimate," "potential," "ambitions," "outlook," or "continue," the negative of these words, other terms of similar meaning, or the use of future dates. Such statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Amcor and are qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of risks and uncertainties. Neither Amcor nor any of its respective directors, executive officers, or advisors, provide any representation, assurance, or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements will actually occur. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, but are not limited to: 
 
 Changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries; 
 the loss of key customers, a reduction in their production requirements, or consolidation among key customers; 
 significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate; 
 an inability to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth, including product innovation, investments, or acquisitions; 
 challenging global economic conditions; 
 impacts of operating internationally; 
 price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials, energy and other inputs, which could adversely affect our business; 
 production, supply, and other commercial risks, including counterparty credit risks, which may be exacerbated in times of economic volatility; 
 pandemics, epidemics, or other disease outbreaks; 
 an inability to attract and retain our global executive team and our skilled workforce and manage key transitions; 
 labor disputes and an inability to renew collective bargaining agreements at acceptable terms; 
 physical impacts of climate change; 
 cybersecurity risks, which could disrupt our operations or risk of loss of our sensitive business information; 
 failures or disruptions in our information technology systems which could disrupt our operations, compromise customer, employee, supplier, and other data; 
 a significant increase in our indebtedness or a downgrade in our credit rating could reduce our operating flexibility and increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations; 
 rising interest rates that increase our borrowing costs on our variable rate indebtedness and could have other negative impacts; 
 foreign exchange rate risk; 
 a significant write-down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets; 
 a failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting; 
 an inability of our insurance policies, including our use of a captive insurance company, to provide adequate protection against all of the risks we face; 
 an inability to defend our intellectual property rights or intellectual property infringement claims against us; 
 litigation, including product liability claims or litigation related to Environmental, Social, and Governance ("ESG") matters, or regulatory developments; 
 increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, suppliers, and governments with respect to our ESG practices and commitments resulting in additional costs or exposure to additional risks; 
 changing ESG government regulations including climate-related rules; 
 changing environmental, health, and safety laws; and 
 changes in tax laws or changes in our geographic mix of earnings. 
 
 These risks and uncertainties are supplemented by those identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including without limitation, those described under Part I, "Item 1A - Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, and as updated by our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

 The fair value estimates for the acquisition were based on market, and cost valuation methods. Pro forma information related to the acquisition has not been presented, as the effect of the acquisition on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements was not material.

 million and million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company's restructuring activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily comprised of restructuring activities related to the 2023 Restructuring Plan (as defined below). 
 
 Restructuring related expenses are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. The Company believes the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more complete information on its restructuring activities. 
 
 2023 Restructuring Plan 
 
 On February 7, 2023, the Company announced that it will allocate approximately million to million of the sale proceeds from the Russian business to various cost saving initiatives to partly offset divested earnings from the Russian business (the "2023 Restructuring Plan" or the "Plan"). The Company expects total Plan cash and non-cash net expenses of approximately million, of which million relates to employee related expenses, million to fixed asset related expenses (net of expected gains on asset disposals), million to other restructuring expenses, and million to restructuring related expenses. The projects initiated as of September 30, 2024 are expected to result in approximately million of net cash expenditures. The Plan includes both the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging reportable segments and is expected to be largely completed by the end of calendar year 2024. 
 
 From the initiation of the Plan through September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred million in employee related expenses, million in fixed asset related expenses, million in other restructuring, and million in restructuring related expenses, with million incurred in the Flexibles reportable segment and million incurred in the Rigid Packaging reportable segment. The Plan has resulted in cumulative net cash outflows of million. Additional cash payments of approximately million, net of estimated proceeds from disposals, are expected until completion of the Plan, which predominantly relates to the Flexibles reportable segment. 
 
 The restructuring related costs relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include startup and training costs after relocation of equipment, and other costs incidental to the Plan. 
 
 Other Restructuring Plans 
 
 The Company has entered into other individually immaterial restructuring plans ("Other Restructuring Plans"). Expenses incurred on such programs are primarily costs to move equipment and other costs.

The carrying value of long-term debt with variable interest rates approximates its fair value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt with fixed interest rates is based on market prices, if available, or expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for financial liabilities with similar risk profiles.

 Additionally, the Company measures and records certain assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments and contingent purchase consideration liabilities, at fair value.

Forward exchange contracts Total assets measured at fair value Liabilities Contingent purchase consideration Commodity contracts Forward exchange contracts Interest rate swaps Cross currency swaps Total liabilities measured at fair value 

Contingent purchase consideration liabilities arise from business acquisitions and other investments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had contingent purchase consideration liabilities of million, consisting of million of contingent purchase consideration predominantly relating to fiscal year 2023 acquisitions and a million liability that is contingent on future royalty income generated by Discma AG, a subsidiary acquired in March 2017. The fair values of the contingent purchase consideration liabilities were determined for each arrangement individually. The fair values were determined using an income approach with significant inputs that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions include the selection of discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achievement and probability-adjusted financial projections. The expected outcomes are recorded at net present value, which require adjustment over the life for changes in risks and probabilities. Changes arising from modifications in forecasts related to contingent consideration are not expected to be material. 
 
 The fair value of contingent purchase consideration liabilities is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

million within the Flexibles reportable segment, to adjust the carrying value of the net assets of million that are held for sale to their estimated fair value less cost to sell. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were impairment charges recorded on indefinite-lived intangibles, including goodwill. For information on long-lived asset impairments, refer to fixed asset related expenses in Note 4, "Restructuring".

Note 8 - 

On August 5, 2024, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract for a notional amount of million. Under the terms of the contract, the Company pays a fixed rate of interest of and receives a variable rate of interest, based on compound overnight Secured Overnight Financing Rate (" SOFR"), effective from August 12, 2024, through June 30, 2025, with monthly settlements commencing on September 1, 2024. The interest rate swap contract will economically hedge the SOFR component of the Company's forecasted commercial paper issuances. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had other receive-variable/pay-fixed interest rate swaps outstanding. As of June 30, 2024, the Company did have receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps outstanding. The Company did not apply hedge accounting on these economic hedging instruments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, the total notional amount of the Company s receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps was million. 

As of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, the notional amount of the outstanding forward contracts was billion. 
 
 In May 2024, the Company entered into cross currency swap contracts for a total notional amount of million. Under the terms of the contracts, the Company swapped the notional and periodic interest payments to Swiss francs to manage the foreign currency risk, and receives a fixed U.S. dollar rate of interest of and pays a fixed weighted-average Swiss franc rate of interest of . The Company has designated these cross currency swap contracts as a fair value hedge of million notes and recognizes the components excluded from the hedging relationship in accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCI") and reclassifies into earnings through the accrual of the periodic interest settlements on the swaps. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had cross currency swaps with a notional amount of million outstanding.

 Forward contracts to purchase own shares 
 
 The Company's employee share plans require the delivery of shares to employees in the future when rights vest or vested options are exercised. The Company currently acquires shares on the open market to deliver shares to employees to satisfy vesting or exercising commitments which exposes the Company to market price risk. 
 
 To protect the Company from share price volatility, the Company has entered into forward contracts for the purchase of its ordinary shares. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had forward contracts outstanding that were entered into in September 2022 and mature in March 2025 to purchase million shares at a weighted average price of . As of June 30, 2024, the Company had forward contracts outstanding that were entered into in September 2022 and matured in September 2024 to purchase million shares at a weighted average price of . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's forward contracts related to million shares were settled, which were outstanding as of June 30, 2024. 
 
 The forward contracts to purchase the Company's own shares have been included in other current liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Equity is reduced by an amount equal to the fair value of the shares at inception. The carrying value of the forward contracts at each reporting period was determined based on the present value of the cost required to settle the contracts.

 million, included in other non-current liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company has estimated a reasonably possible loss exposure in excess of the recorded accrual of million as of September 30, 2024. The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters cannot be accurately predicted. The Company routinely assesses these matters as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records the best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where the likelihood of an ultimate loss is probable. The Company's assessments are based on its knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these matters may differ from the Company's estimates. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company provided letters of credit of million, judicial insurance of million, and deposited cash of million with the courts to continue to defend the cases referenced above. 
 
 Contingencies - Environmental Matters 
 
 The Company, along with others, has been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at several waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may face potentially material environmental remediation obligations. While the Company benefits from various forms of insurance policies, actual coverage may not, or may only partially, cover the total potential exposures. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded aggregate accruals of million for its share of estimated future remediation costs at these sites. 
 
 In addition to the matters described above, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has also recorded aggregate accruals of million for potential liabilities for remediation obligations at various worldwide locations that are owned or operated by the Company, or were formerly owned or operated. 
 
 The SEC requires the Company to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental provisions if the Company reasonably believes that such proceeding may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to SEC regulations, the Company uses a threshold of 1 million or more for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters required to be disclosed for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 While the Company believes that its accruals are adequate to cover its future obligations, there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not exceed the accrued amounts. Nevertheless, based on the available information, the Company does not believe that its potential environmental obligations will have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition.

Overview 
 
 Amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging solutions across a variety of materials for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care, and other products. We work with leading companies around the world to protect products, differentiate brands, and improve supply chains. We offer a range of innovative, differentiating flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, closures, and services. We are focused on making packaging that is increasingly recyclable, reusable, lighter weight, and made using an increasing amount of recycled content. In fiscal year 2024, 41,000 Amcor people generated 13.6 billion in annual sales from operations that span 212 locations in 40 countries. 

Significant Developments Affecting the Periods Presented 
 
 Economic and Market Conditions 
 
 We continue to be impacted by softer consumer demand and customer order volatility in certain markets, and higher costs in certain areas, such as labor costs. The underlying causes for the market volatility being experienced can be attributed to a variety of factors, such as geopolitical tension and conflicts, inflation in many economies impacting consumption and consumer demand, and customer destocking following a period of supply chain constraints. In this context, we have remained focused on taking price and cost actions to offset inflation and aligning our cost base with market dynamics. Sequentially improved volumes over the last three fiscal quarters combined with the realization of benefits from structural cost initiatives and the flexing of our cost base to adjust to market conditions has resulted in improved performance and we expect this improvement to continue in fiscal year 2025. However, there is no assurance that we will meet our performance expectations or that ongoing geopolitical tensions and other factors will not negatively impact our financial results. 
 
 Russia-Ukraine Conflict / 2023 Restructuring Plan 
 
 On February 7, 2023, we announced that we expect to invest 110 million to 130 million of the sale proceeds from our Russian business sold in December 2022 for net cash proceeds of 365 million in various cost savings initiatives to partly offset divested earnings from the Russian business (the "2023 Restructuring Plan" or the "Plan"). We expect total Plan cash and non-cash net expenses of approximately 220 million. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have initiated restructuring and related projects with an expected net cost of approximately 220 million, of which approximately 130 million is expected to result in net cash expenditures. From the initiation of the Plan until September 30, 2024, we have incurred 82 million in employee-related expenses, 32 million in fixed asset related expenses, 50 million in other restructuring, and 23 million in restructuring related expenses. The Plan has resulted in 86 million of cumulative net cash outflows to date. Management expects to realize an annualized pre-tax benefit of approximately 50 million from structural cost reduction actions taken as a result of all Russia related restructuring by the end of fiscal year 2025. 
 
 For further information, refer to Note 4, "Restructuring," of Part I , " Item 1 , Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ". 
 
 Highly Inflationary Accounting 
 
 We have subsidiaries in Argentina that historically had a functional currency of the Argentine Peso. As of June 30, 2018, the Argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2018, we began reporting the financial results of our Argentine subsidiaries with a functional currency of the Argentine Peso at the functional currency of the parent, which is the U.S. dollar. Following the governmental election in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, Argentina devalued the Argentine Peso by approximately 55 against the U.S. dollar. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Argentine Peso stabilized against the U.S. dollar and the Argentine peso has since been relatively stable against the U.S. dollar. The impact of highly inflationary accounting in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 resulted in a negative impact on monetary assets of 2 million and 17 million, respectively, in foreign currency transaction losses that were reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. Our operations in Argentina represented approximately 2 of our consolidated net sales and annual adjusted earnings before interest and tax in the last two fiscal years.

Presentation of Non-GAAP Information 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refers to non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ("Adjusted EBIT"), earnings before interest and tax ("EBIT"), adjusted net income, and net debt. Such measures have not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable. These measures exclude the impact of certain amounts related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equipment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation, and the write-down of equipment. These measures also exclude gains or losses on sales of significant property and divestitures, significant property and other impairments, net of insurance recovery, certain regulatory and litigation matters, significant pension settlements, impairments in goodwill and equity method investments, and certain acquisition-related expenses, including transaction and integration expenses, due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, order backlog, intangible amortization, changes in the fair value of contingent acquisition payments and economic hedging instruments on commercial paper, CEO transition costs, and impacts related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Note that while amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, the revenue of the acquired entities and all other expenses unless otherwise stated, are reflected in Adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income and the acquired assets contribute to revenue generation. 
 
 This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use the non-GAAP measures to evaluate operating performance and believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors and other external parties to perform comparisons of our current and historical performance.

New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Refer to Note 2, "New Accounting Guidance," in "Item 1. Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements". 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. There have been no material changes in critical accounting estimates and judgments as of September 30, 2024 from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings from banks, and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity. We periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions, expected future cash flows, potential funding requirements for debt refinancing, capital expenditures and acquisitions, the cost of capital, sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios, the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings, and our ease of access to funding sources. 
 
 We believe that our cash flows provided by operating activities, together with borrowings available under our credit facilities and access to the commercial paper market, backstopped by our bank debt facilities, will continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and other commitments, including dividends and purchases of our ordinary shares and CHESS Depositary Instruments under authorized share repurchase programs, into the foreseeable future.

 Cash Flow Overview 
 
 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities increased by 134 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily driven by higher working capital outflows in the current period. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 13 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily driven by higher outflows for purchase of property, plant, and equipment compared to the prior period. 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased by 96 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily driven by higher drawdowns of commercial paper in the current period and prior period share buyback activity which did not reoccur in the current period. 
 
 Net Debt 
 
 We borrow from financial institutions and debt investors in the form of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, and commercial paper. We have a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates and use interest rate swaps to provide further flexibility in managing the interest cost of borrowings. 
 
 On August 5, 2024, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract for a notional amount of 500 million. Under the terms of the contract, the Company will pay a fixed rate of interest of 4.30 and receive a variable rate of interest, based on compound overnight SOFR, effective from August 12, 2024, through June 30, 2025, with monthly settlements commencing on September 1, 2024. The interest rate swap contract will economically hedge the SOFR component of the Company's forecasted commercial paper issuances. 
 
 Short-term debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 months and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the short-term nature of the borrowings, except where we have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt beyond 12 months. The current portion of long-term debt consists of debt amounts repayable within a year after the balance sheet date. 
 
 41 

Our primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured indebtedness we can incur to 10.0 of our total tangible assets, subject to some exceptions and variations by facility. In addition, the covenants of the bank debt facilities require us to maintain a leverage ratio not higher than 3.9 times. The negative pledge arrangements and the financial covenants are defined in the related debt agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank debt facilities. 
 
 Our net debt as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was 6.9 billion and 6.1 billion, respectively. 
 
 Debt Facilities 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had undrawn credit facilities available in the amount of 1.9 billion. Our senior facilities are available to fund working capital, growth capital expenditures, and refinancing obligations and are provided to us by two bank syndicates. On April 23, 2024, we extended the maturity of our three-year syndicated facility agreement by one year until April 2026. The three-year syndicated facility agreement will be reduced from 1.9 billion to 1.7 billion effective April 2025. Our five-year syndicated credit facility matures in April 2027 and provides a revolving credit facility of 1.9 billion. The three-year facility has one 12-month option available to us to extend the maturity date and the five-year facility has two 12-month options available to us to extend the maturity date. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the revolving senior bank debt facilities had an aggregate limit of 3.8 billion, of which 1.9 billion had been drawn (inclusive of amounts drawn under commercial paper programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilities). Subject to certain conditions, we can request the total commitment level under each agreement to be increased by up to 500 million. 
 
 Dividend Payments 
 
 We declared and paid a 0.1250 cash dividend per ordinary share during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Credit Rating 
 
 Our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating agencies. These investment grade credit ratings are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest, for various terms, and from a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid, including European and U.S. debt capital markets, and from global financial institutions. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 On February 7, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 100 million buyback of ordinary shares and/or CHESS Depositary Instruments ("CDIs") in the following twelve months. On February 6, 2024, our Board of Directors extended the approval for the remaining 39 million of ordinary shares and CDIs of the 100 million buyback for twelve months. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares were repurchased under this program. 
 
 We had cash outflows of 43 million and 45 million for the purchase of our own shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as treasury shares to satisfy the vesting and exercises of share-based compensation awards. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we held treasury shares at a cost of 9 million and 11 million, respectively, representing approximately 1 million shares at both dates. 
 42 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 There have been no material changes in our market risk during the three months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information, refer to Note 7, "Fair Value Measurements," and Note 8, "Derivative Instruments," in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and to "Item 7A. - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 
 43 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 The material set forth in Note 14, "Contingencies and Legal Proceedings," in "Item 1. Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Other than the update to the risk factor set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors contained in "Item 1A. - Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 
 Attracting and Retaining Skilled Workforce If we are unable to attract and retain our global executive management team and our skilled workforce, we may be adversely affected. 
 
 Our continued success depends on our ability to identify, attract, develop, and retain skilled and diverse personnel in our global executive management team and our operations. We focus on our talent acquisition processes, as well as our onboarding and talent and leadership programs, to ensure that our key new hires and skilled personnel s efficiency and effectiveness align with Amcor s values and ways of working. In March 2024, we announced the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer Ron Delia and the appointment of Peter Konieczny as our Interim Chief Executive Officer. On September 4, 2024, after a robust internal and external search, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Mr. Konieczny as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective immediately. Any failure to successfully transition key roles could impact our ability to execute on our strategic plans, make it difficult to meet our performance objectives, and be disruptive to our business. 
 
 We are also, at times, impacted by regional labor shortages, inflationary pressures on wages, a competitive labor market, and changing demographics. While we have been successful to date in responding to regional labor shortages and maintaining plans for continuity of succession, there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage future labor shortages or recruit, develop, assimilate, motivate, and retain employees in the future who actively promote and meet the standards of our culture. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 We did not repurchase shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The table below is presented in millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts, which are expressed in U.S. dollars: 
 
 Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Programs (1) July 1 - 31, 2024 39 August 1 - 31, 2024 39 September 1 - 30, 2024 39 Total 
 
 (1) On February 7, 2023, our Board of Directors approved an on market share buyback of up to 100 million of ordinary shares and/or CDIs during the following twelve months. On February 6, 2024, our Board of Directors extended the approval for the remaining 39 million of ordinary shares and/or CDIs of the 100 million buyback for an additional twelve months. The timing, volume, and nature of share repurchases may be amended, suspended, or discontinued at any time.
