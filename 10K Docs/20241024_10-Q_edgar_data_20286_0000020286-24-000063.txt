 The decrease in net unrealized investment losses in our fixed-maturity portfolio at September 30, 2024, is primarily due to a decrease in U.S. Treasury yields and a tightening of corporate credit spreads as well as realized losses on sales of some lower-yielding fixed maturities. Our asset-backed securities had an average rating of Aa2/AA- and Aa3/AA- at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 We use actuarial methods, models and judgment to estimate, as of a financial statement date, the property casualty loss and loss expense reserves required to pay for and settle all outstanding insured claims, including incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, as of that date. The actuarial estimate is subject to review and adjustment by an inter-departmental committee that includes actuarial, claims, underwriting, loss prevention and accounting management. This committee is familiar with relevant company and industry business, claims and underwriting trends, as well as general economic and legal trends that could affect future loss and loss expense payments. The amount we will actually have to pay for claims can be highly uncertain. This uncertainty, together with the size of our reserves, makes the loss and loss expense reserves our most significant estimate. The reserve for loss and loss expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets also included million and million at September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, for certain life and health loss and loss expense reserves. 
 
 We experienced million of favorable development on prior accident years, including million of favorable development in commercial lines, less than million of unfavorable development in personal lines and million of unfavorable development in excess and surplus lines for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Within commercial lines, we recognized favorable reserve development of million for the commercial property line and million for the workers' compensation line due to reduced uncertainty of prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense for these lines. 
 
 We experienced million of favorable development on prior accident years, including million of favorable development in commercial lines, million of favorable development in personal lines and million of unfavorable development in excess and surplus lines for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Within commercial lines, we recognized favorable reserve development of million for the commercial property line, million for the workers' compensation line and million for the commercial auto line due to reduced uncertainty of prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense for these lines. This was partially offset by unfavorable reserve development of million for the commercial casualty line. Within personal lines, we recognized favorable reserve development of million for the homeowner line.

SM (Cincinnati Global) will be realized. As a result, we have valuation allowance for our U.S. domestic operations or Cincinnati Global at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we were notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that the audit of tax years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, has concluded. Despite this, the statute of limitations remains open through September of 2025.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the condensed consolidated results of operations and financial position of Cincinnati Financial Corporation. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise noted, the industry data is prepared by A.M. Best Co., a leading insurance industry statistical, analytical and financial strength rating organization. Information from A.M. Best is presented on a statutory basis for insurance company regulation in the United States of America. When we provide our results on a comparable statutory basis, we label it as such; all other company data is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). 
 
 We present per share data on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted, adjusting those amounts for all stock splits and dividends. Dollar amounts are rounded to millions; calculations of percent changes are based on dollar amounts rounded to the nearest million. Certain percentage changes are identified as not meaningful (nm). 

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT 
 This is our Safe Harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report.

 Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: 
 Effects of any future pandemic, or the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, that could affect results for reasons such as: 
 Securities market disruption or volatility and related effects such as decreased economic activity and continued supply chain disruptions that affect our investment portfolio and book value 
 An unusually high level of claims in our insurance or reinsurance operations that increase litigation-related expenses 
 An unusually high level of insurance losses, including risk of court decisions extending business interruption insurance in commercial property coverage forms to cover claims for pure economic loss related to such pandemic 
 Decreased premium revenue and cash flow from disruption to our distribution channel of independent agents, consumer self-isolation, travel limitations, business restrictions and decreased economic activity 
 Inability of our workforce, agencies or vendors to perform necessary business functions 
 Unusually high levels of catastrophe losses due to risk concentrations, changes in weather patterns (whether as a result of global climate change or otherwise), environmental events, war or political unrest, terrorism incidents, cyberattacks, civil unrest or other causes 
 Increased frequency and/or severity of claims or development of claims that are unforeseen at the time of policy issuance, due to inflationary trends or other causes 
 Inadequate estimates or assumptions, or reliance on third-party data used for critical accounting estimates 
 Declines in overall stock market values negatively affecting our equity portfolio and book value 
 Interest rate fluctuations or other factors that could significantly affect: 
 Our ability to generate growth in investment income 
 Values of our fixed-maturity investments, including accounts in which we hold bank-owned life insurance contract assets 
 Our traditional life policy reserves 
 Domestic and global events, such as Russia s invasion of Ukraine, war in the Middle East and disruptions in the banking and financial services industry, resulting in insurance losses, capital market or credit market uncertainty, followed by prolonged periods of economic instability or recession, that lead to: 
 Significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a particular security or group of securities and impairment of the asset(s) 
 Significant decline in investment income due to reduced or eliminated dividend payouts from a particular security or group of securities

 Significant rise in losses from surety or director and officer policies written for financial institutions or other insured entities or in losses from policies written by Cincinnati Re or Cincinnati Global 
 Our inability to manage Cincinnati Global or other subsidiaries to produce related business opportunities and growth prospects for our ongoing operations 
 Recession, prolonged elevated inflation or other economic conditions resulting in lower demand for insurance products or increased payment delinquencies 
 Ineffective information technology systems or discontinuing to develop and implement improvements in technology may impact our success and profitability 
 Difficulties with technology or data security breaches, including cyberattacks, that could negatively affect our or our agents ability to conduct business; disrupt our relationships with agents, policyholders and others; cause reputational damage, mitigation expenses and data loss and expose us to liability under federal and state laws

 Disruption of the insurance market caused by technology innovations such as driverless cars that could decrease consumer demand for insurance products 
 Delays, inadequate data developed internally or from third parties, or performance inadequacies from ongoing development and implementation of underwriting and pricing methods, including telematics and other usage-based insurance methods, or technology projects and enhancements expected to increase our pricing accuracy, underwriting profit and competitiveness 
 Intense competition, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which we operate, could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and profitability 
 Changing consumer insurance-buying habits and consolidation of independent insurance agencies could alter our competitive advantages 
 Inability to obtain adequate ceded reinsurance on acceptable terms, amount of reinsurance coverage purchased, financial strength of reinsurers and the potential for nonpayment or delay in payment by reinsurers 
 Inability to defer policy acquisition costs for any business segment if pricing and loss trends would lead management to conclude that segment could not achieve sustainable profitability 
 Inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends consistent with current or past levels

 Perceptions that our level of service, particularly claims service, is no longer a distinguishing characteristic in the marketplace 
 Inability or unwillingness to nimbly develop and introduce coverage product updates and innovations that our competitors offer and consumers expect to find in the marketplace 
 Actions of insurance departments, state attorneys general or other regulatory agencies, including a change to a federal system of regulation from a state-based system, that: 
 Impose new obligations on us that increase our expenses or change the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates 
 Place the insurance industry under greater regulatory scrutiny or result in new statutes, rules and regulations

 Our inability, or the inability of our independent agents, to attract and retain personnel in a competitive labor market, impacting the customer experience and altering our competitive advantages 
 Events, such as an epidemic, natural catastrophe or terrorism, that could hamper our ability to assemble our workforce at our headquarters location or work effectively in a remote environment 
 Further, our insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, global, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. We also are subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for our common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

 Total revenues increased 1.509 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, including higher earned premiums, investment income and net investment gains. For the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same period of 2023, total revenues increased 2.142 billion, including higher earned premiums, investment income and net investment gains. Premium and investment revenue trends are discussed further in the respective sections of Financial Results. 
 
 Investment gains and losses are recognized on the sales of investments, on certain changes in fair values of securities even though we continue to hold the securities or as otherwise required by GAAP. We have substantial discretion in the timing of investment sales, and that timing generally is independent of the insurance underwriting process. The change in fair value of securities is also generally independent of the insurance underwriting process. 
 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, increased 919 million, including increases of 956 million in after-tax net investment gains and losses and 26 million in after-tax investment income, partially offset by a 40 million decrease in after-tax property casualty underwriting income. Catastrophe losses for the third quarter of 2024, mostly weather related, were 86 million higher after taxes and unfavorably affected both net income and property casualty underwriting income. Life insurance segment results decreased by 7 million on a pretax basis. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, net income increased 1.227 billion, compared with the first nine months of 2023, 
 including increases of 1.120 billion in after-tax investment gains and losses, 62 million in after-tax property casualty underwriting income and 71 million in after-tax investment income. Catastrophe losses for the first nine months of 2024, mostly weather related, matched the same period in 2023. Life insurance segment results increased by 4 million on a pretax basis. 
 
 Performance by segment is discussed below in Financial Results. As discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 7, Executive Summary, Page 48, there are several reasons why our performance during 2024 may ultimately be below our long-term targets. 
 
 The board of directors is committed to rewarding shareholders directly through cash dividends and through share repurchase authorizations. Through 2023, the company had increased the annual cash dividend rate for 63 consecutive years, a record we believe is matched by only seven other U.S. publicly traded companies. In January 2024, the board of directors increased the regular quarterly dividend to 81 cents per share, setting the stage for our 64 th consecutive year of increasing cash dividends. During the first nine months of 2024, cash dividends declared by the company increased 8 compared with the same period of 2023. Our board regularly evaluates relevant factors in decisions related to dividends and share repurchases. The 2024 dividend increase reflected our strong operating performance and signaled management's and the board's positive outlook and confidence in our outstanding capital, liquidity and financial flexibility.

 Total assets at September 30, 2024, increased 13 compared with year-end 2023, and included an 11 increase in total investments that reflected net purchases and higher fair values for many securities in our equity portfolio. Shareholders' equity increased 14 and book value per share increased 15 during the first nine months of 2024. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio (capital is the sum of debt plus shareholders' equity) decreased compared with year-end 2023. 
 
 Our value creation ratio is our primary performance metric. As shown in the tables below, that ratio was 17.8 for the first nine months of 2024, better than 4.4 for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a higher amount in overall net gains from our investment portfolio. Book value per share increased 11.26 during the first nine months of 2024 and contributed 14.6 percentage points to the value creation ratio, while dividends declared at 2.43 per share contributed 3.2 points. Value creation ratio major contributors and in total, along with calculations from per-share amounts, are shown in the tables below.

DRIVERS OF LONG-TERM VALUE CREATION 
 Operating through The Cincinnati Insurance Company, Cincinnati Financial Corporation is one of the 25 largest property casualty insurers in the nation, based on 2023 net written premiums for approximately 2,000 U.S. stock and mutual insurer groups. We market our insurance products through a select group of independent insurance agencies as discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1, Our Business and Our Strategy, Page 6. At September 30, 2024, we actively marketed through 2,196 agencies located in 46 states. We maintain a long-term perspective that guides us in addressing immediate challenges or opportunities while focusing on the major decisions that best position our company for success through all market cycles. 
 
 To measure our long-term progress in creating shareholder value, our value creation ratio is our primary financial performance target. As discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 7, Executive Summary, Page 48, management believes this measure is a meaningful indicator of our long-term progress in creating shareholder value and has three primary performance drivers: 
 
 Premium growth We believe our agency relationships and initiatives can lead to a property casualty written premium growth rate over any five-year period that exceeds the industry average. For the first nine months of 2024, our consolidated property casualty net written premium year-over-year growth was 14 , comparing favorably with the industry's 10 growth rate reported by A.M. Best for the first six months of 2024. For the five-year period 2019 through 2023, our growth rate exceeded that of the industry. The industry's growth rate excludes its mortgage and financial guaranty lines of business. 
 Combined ratio We believe our underwriting philosophy and initiatives can generate an average GAAP combined ratio over any five-year period that is consistently within the range of 92 to 98 . For the first nine months of 2024, our GAAP combined ratio was 96.5 , including 11.2 percentage points of current accident year catastrophe losses partially offset by 3.3 percentage points of favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years. Our statutory combined ratio was 95.7 for the first nine months of 2024, comparing favorably with the industry's 97.7 reported by A.M. Best for the first six months of 2024. The industry's ratio again excludes its mortgage and financial guaranty lines of business. 
 Investment contribution We believe our investment philosophy and initiatives can drive investment income growth and lead to a total return on our equity investment portfolio over a five-year period that exceeds the five-year return of the Standard Poor's 500 Index. For the first nine months of 2024, pretax investment income was 745 million, up 14 compared with the same period in 2023. We believe our investment portfolio mix provides an appropriate balance of income stability and growth with capital appreciation potential.

 Financial Strength 
 An important part of our long-term strategy is financial strength, which is described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1, Our Business and Our Strategy, Financial Strength, Page 8. One aspect of our financial strength is prudent use of reinsurance ceded to help manage financial performance variability due to catastrophe loss experience. A description of how we use reinsurance ceded is included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 7, Liquidity and Capital Resources, 2024 Reinsurance Ceded Programs, Page 105. Another aspect of our financial strength is our investment portfolio, which remains well-diversified as discussed in this quarterly report in Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our strong parent-company liquidity and financial strength increase our flexibility to maintain a cash dividend through all periods and to continue to invest in and expand our insurance operations. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we held 5.419 billion of our cash and cash equivalents and invested assets at the parent-company level, of which 4.639 billion, or 85.6 , was invested in common stocks, and 645 million, or 11.9 , was cash or cash equivalents. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio was 5.6 at September 30, 2024. Another important indicator of financial strength is our ratio of property casualty net written premiums to statutory surplus, which was 1.0-to-1 for the 12 months ended September 30, 2024, matching year-end 2023. 
 
 Financial strength ratings assigned to us by independent rating firms also are important. In addition to rating our parent company's senior debt, four firms award insurer financial strength ratings to one or more of our insurance subsidiary companies based on their quantitative and qualitative analyses. These ratings primarily assess an insurer's ability to meet financial obligations to policyholders and do not necessarily address all of the matters that may be important to investors. Ratings are under continuous review and subject to change or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating; please see each rating agency's website for its most recent report on our ratings. 
 
 At October 23, 2024, our insurance subsidiaries continued to be highly rated.

 Our consolidated property casualty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of 62 million for the third quarter and 228 million for the first nine months of 2024. The third-quarter 2024 underwriting profit decrease of 50 million, compared with third-quarter 2023, included an unfavorable increase of 109 million in losses from catastrophes, mostly caused by severe weather. The third-quarter 2024 change in underwriting profitability also included higher current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses that grew slower than earned premiums and higher amounts of favorable reserve development on prior accident years. The nine-month 2024 underwriting profit increase of 79 million, compared with the first nine months of 2023, included losses from catastrophes that matched. In addition, the nine-month 2024 period experienced higher current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses that grew slower than earned premiums and a lower amount of favorable reserve development on prior accident years before catastrophe losses. 
 
 Underwriting results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 included improved current accident year loss experience before catastrophe losses, as price increases have helped to offset recent-year elevated paid losses reflecting economic or other forms of inflation. Elevated inflation was a driver of higher losses and loss expenses in both 2024 and 2023 as costs have increased significantly to repair damaged autos or other property that we insure. We also experienced higher losses for liability coverages for some of our lines of business. Due to increased uncertainty regarding ultimate losses, we intend to remain prudent in reserving for estimated ultimate losses until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. The higher loss experience is discussed in Financial Results by property casualty insurance segment. We believe future property casualty underwriting results will continue to benefit from price increases and our ongoing initiatives to improve pricing precision and loss experience related to claims and loss control practices. 
 Cincinnati Financial Corporation Third-Quarter 2024 10-Q

Table of Contents 

 For all property casualty lines of business in aggregate, net loss and loss expense reserves at September 30, 2024, were 963 million, or 11 , higher than at year-end 2023, including an increase of 917 million for the incurred but not reported (IBNR) portion. 
 
 We measure and analyze property casualty underwriting results primarily by the combined ratio and its component ratios. The GAAP-basis combined ratio is the percentage of incurred losses plus all expenses per each earned premium dollar the lower the ratio, the better the performance. An underwriting profit results when the combined ratio is below 100 . A combined ratio above 100 indicates that an insurance company's losses and expenses exceeded premiums. 
 
 Our consolidated property casualty combined ratio for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 3.0 percentage points, compared with the same period of 2023, including an increase of 3.9 points from catastrophe losses and loss expenses. For the first nine months of 2024, compared with the 2023 nine-month period, our combined ratio improved by 1.0 percentage points, including a decrease of 1.2 points from catastrophe losses and loss expenses. Other combined ratio components that changed are discussed below and in further detail in Financial Results by property casualty insurance segment. 
 
 The combined ratio can be affected significantly by natural catastrophe losses and other large losses as discussed in detail below. The combined ratio can also be affected by updated estimates of loss and loss expense reserves established for claims that occurred in prior periods, referred to as prior accident years. Net favorable development on prior accident year reserves, including reserves for catastrophe losses, benefited the combined ratio by 3.3 percentage points in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 3.8 percentage points in the same period of 2023. Net favorable development is discussed in further detail in Financial Results by property casualty insurance segment. 
 
 The ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses improved in the first nine months of 2024. That 58.6 ratio was 1.1 percentage points lower, compared with the 59.7 accident year 2023 ratio measured as of September 30, 2023, including a decrease of 1.2 points in the ratio for large losses of 2 million or more per claim, discussed below. The ratio improvement of 1.1 percentage points included an increase of 1.1 points for the IBNR portion and a decrease of 2.2 points for the case incurred portion. 
 
 The underwriting expense ratio decreased for the third quarter and increased for the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods a year ago. The third-quarter 2024 decrease was largely due to a decrease in profit-sharing commissions for agencies. The nine-month 2024 increase was largely due to increases in profit-sharing commissions for agencies and employee-related expenses. The ratios also included ongoing expense management efforts and higher earned premiums.

 The trends in net written premiums and earned premiums summarized in the table above include the effects of price increases. Price change trends that heavily influence renewal written premium increases or decreases, along with other premium growth drivers for 2024, are discussed in more detail by segment below in Financial Results. 
 
 Consolidated property casualty net written premiums for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, grew 336 million and 874 million compared with the same periods of 2023. Our premium growth initiatives from prior years have provided an ongoing favorable effect on growth during the current year, particularly as newer agency relationships mature over time. 
 
 Consolidated property casualty agency new business written premiums increased by 93 million and 292 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023. New agency appointments during 2024 and 2023 produced a 82 million increase in standard lines new business for the first nine months of 2024 compared with the same period of 2023. As we appoint new agencies that choose to move accounts to us, we report these accounts as new business. While this business is new to us, in many cases it is not new to the agent. We believe these seasoned accounts tend to be priced more accurately than business that may be less familiar to our agent upon obtaining it from a competing agent. 
 
 Net written premiums for Cincinnati Re, included in other written premiums, increased by 4 million in the third quarter and 6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, to 89 million and 498 million, respectively. Cincinnati Re assumes risks through reinsurance treaties and in some cases cedes part of the risk and related premiums to one or more unaffiliated reinsurance companies through transactions known as retrocessions. 
 
 Cincinnati Global is also included in other written premiums. Net written premiums for Cincinnati Global increased by 8 million in the third quarter and 11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 77 million and 226 million, respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023. 
 
 Other written premiums include premiums ceded to reinsurers as part of our reinsurance ceded program. An increase in ceded premiums reduced net written premiums by 16 million and 32 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the same period of 2023. 
 
 Catastrophe losses and loss expenses typically have a material effect on property casualty results and can vary significantly from period to period. Losses from catastrophes contributed 13.0 and 10.1 percentage points to the combined ratio in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with 9.1 and 11.3 percentage points in the same period of 2023. 
 
 Effective June 1, 2024, we restructured our reinsurance program for Cincinnati Re only, providing retrocession coverages with various triggers, exclusions and unique features. That program included property catastrophe excess of loss coverage with a total available aggregate limit of 60 million in excess of 80 million per occurrence. Coverage for Cincinnati Re only with a total available aggregate limit of 20 million in excess of 80 million per occurrence expired during the second quarter of 2024. That expiration also included the shared coverage for Cincinnati Re and the direct business applying to catastrophe losses in excess of 600 million. Ceded premiums for the one-year renewal period of coverage from the treaty effective June 1, 2024, are estimated to be approximately 16 million.

 We believe the inherent variability of aggregate loss experience for our portfolio of larger policies is greater than that of our portfolio of smaller policies, and we continue to monitor the variability in addition to general inflationary trends in loss costs. Our analysis continues to indicate no unexpected concentration of large losses and case reserve increases by risk category, geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. The third-quarter 2024 property casualty total large losses incurred of 88 million, net of reinsurance, was lower than the 95 million quarterly average during full-year 2023 and the 108 million experienced for the third quarter of 2023. The ratio for these large losses was 1.5 percentage points lower compared with last year's third quarter. The third-quarter 2024 amount of total large losses incurred helped contribute to the decrease in the nine-month 2024 total large loss ratio, compared with 2023, in addition to a first-half 2024 ratio that was 1.4 points lower than the first half of 2023. We believe results for the three- and nine-month periods largely reflected normal fluctuations in loss patterns and normal variability in large case reserves for claims above 2 million. Losses by size are discussed in further detail in results of operations by property casualty insurance segment.

 Overview 
 Performance highlights for the commercial lines segment include: 
 Premiums Earned premiums and net written premiums for the commercial lines segment grew during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods a year ago, due to agency renewal written premium growth that continued to include higher average pricing as well as growth in agency new business written premiums. The table below analyzes the primary components of premiums. We continue to use predictive analytics tools to improve pricing precision and segmentation while leveraging our local relationships with agents through the efforts of our teams that work closely with them. We seek to maintain appropriate pricing discipline for both new and renewal business as our agents and underwriters assess account quality to make careful decisions on a policy-by-policy basis whether to write or renew a policy. 
 Agency renewal written premiums increased 8 for the third quarter and 5 for the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, including price increases. During the third quarter of 2024, our overall standard commercial lines policies averaged estimated renewal price increases at percentages in the high-single-digit range. We continue to segment commercial lines policies, emphasizing identification and retention of those we believe have relatively stronger pricing. Conversely, we have been seeking stricter renewal terms and conditions on policies we believe have relatively weaker pricing, thus retaining fewer of those policies. We measure average changes in commercial lines renewal pricing as the percentage rate of change in renewal premium for the new policy period compared with the premium for the expiring policy period, assuming no change in the level of insured exposures or policy coverage between those periods for the respective policies. 
 Cincinnati Financial Corporation Third-Quarter 2024 10-Q 
 Page 45 

Table of Contents 

 Our average overall commercial lines renewal pricing change includes the impact of flat pricing for certain coverages within package policies written for a three-year term that were in force but did not expire during the period being measured. Therefore, our reported change in average commercial lines renewal pricing reflects a blend of three-year policies that did not expire and other policies that did expire during the measurement period. For commercial lines policies that did expire and were then renewed during the third quarter of 2024, we estimate that our average percentage price increases were in the high-single-digit range for our commercial casualty, commercial property and commercial auto lines of business. The estimated average percentage price change for workers' compensation was a decrease in the mid-single-digit range. 
 Our commercial lines segment's increase in agency renewal written premiums for the first nine months of 2024 also included changes in the level of insured exposures. Part of the insured exposure increase reflects our response to inflation effects that increase the cost of building materials to repair damaged commercial structures. We use building valuation software to automate much of that underwriting process and may also manually adjust premiums to reflect property costs. 
 Renewal premiums for certain policies, primarily our commercial casualty and workers' compensation lines of business, include the results of policy audits that adjust initial premium amounts based on differences between estimated and actual sales or payroll related to a specific policy. Audits completed during the first nine months of 2024 contributed 81 million to net written premiums, compared with 105 million for the same period of 2023. 
 New business written premiums for commercial lines increased 39 million and 131 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, as we continued to carefully underwrite each policy in a highly competitive market. Trend analysis for year-over-year comparisons of individual quarters is more difficult to assess for commercial lines new business written premiums, due to inherent variability. That variability is often driven by larger policies with annual premiums greater than 100,000. 
 Other written premiums include premiums ceded to reinsurers as part of our reinsurance ceded program. For our commercial lines insurance segment, an increase in ceded premiums reduced net written premiums by 5 million and 11 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023.

 Combined ratio The third-quarter 2024 commercial lines combined ratio improved by 2.2 percentage points, compared with the third quarter of 2023, including a decrease of 1.3 points in losses from catastrophes. The third-quarter combined ratio increased by 0.2 points from current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses, including an increase of 2.9 points for the IBNR portion and a decrease of 2.7 points for the case incurred portion. For the first nine months of 2024, the combined ratio improved by 1.3 percentage points, compared with the same period a year ago, including a decrease of 2.5 points in losses from catastrophes. The nine-month 2024 combined ratio also included a decrease of 0.3 points from current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses, including an increase of 2.4 points in the IBNR portion and a decrease of 2.7 points for the case incurred portion. Underwriting results also included higher third-quarter 2024 and lower nine-month 2024 levels of favorable reserve development on prior accident years, as discussed below. The current accident year ratios were measured as of September 30 of the respective years and included a decrease of 1.5 percentage points for the first nine months of 2024 in the ratio for large losses of 2 million or more per claim, discussed below. 
 When estimating the ultimate cost of total loss and loss expenses, we consider many factors, including trends for inflation, historical paid and reported losses, large loss activity and other data or information for the industry or our company. Elevated inflation in recent years has been a driver of higher losses and loss expenses as costs have increased significantly to repair damaged business property or autos that we insure, in addition to 
 Cincinnati Financial Corporation Third-Quarter 2024 10-Q 
 Page 46 

Table of Contents 

 higher losses for liability coverages for some of our lines of business. Due to increased uncertainty regarding ultimate losses, we intend to remain prudent in reserving for estimated ultimate losses until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. 
 Catastrophe losses and loss expenses accounted for 5.4 and 6.9 percentage points of the combined ratio for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with 6.7 and 9.4 percentage points for the same periods a year ago. Through 2023, the 10-year annual average for that catastrophe measure for the commercial lines segment was 5.9 percentage points, and the five-year annual average was 6.5 percentage points. 
 The net effect of reserve development on prior accident years during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was favorable for commercial lines overall by 50 million and 117 million, compared with 34 million and 125 million for the same periods in 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, our commercial property and workers' compensation lines of business were the main contributors to the commercial lines net favorable reserve development. The net favorable reserve development recognized during the first nine months of 2024 for our commercial lines insurance segment was mainly for accident years 2023 and 2022 and was primarily due to lower-than-anticipated loss emergence on known claims. Our commercial casualty line of business included 27 million of unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years for the first nine months of 2024. Reserve estimates are inherently uncertain as described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves, Page 53. 
 The commercial lines underwriting expense ratio decreased for the third quarter and increased for the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods a year ago. The third-quarter 2024 decrease was largely due to a decrease in profit-sharing commissions for agencies. The nine-month 2024 increase was primarily due to an increase in profit-sharing commissions for agencies and employee-related expenses. The ratios also included ongoing expense management efforts and higher earned premiums.

 We continue to monitor new losses and case reserve increases greater than 2 million for trends in factors such as initial reserve levels, loss cost inflation and claim settlement expenses. Our analysis continues to indicate no unexpected concentration of these large losses and case reserve increases by risk category, geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. The third-quarter 2024 commercial lines total large losses incurred of 67 million, net of reinsurance, was lower than the quarterly average of 74 million during full-year 2023 and the 76 million of total large losses incurred for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in commercial lines large losses for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to our commercial property line of business. The third-quarter 2024 ratio for commercial lines total large losses was 1.2 percentage points lower than last year's third-quarter ratio. The third-quarter 2024 amount of total large losses incurred helped contribute to the decrease in the nine-month 2024 total large loss ratio, compared with 2023, in addition to a first-half 2024 ratio that was 1.7 points lower than the first half of 2023. We believe results for the three- and nine-month periods largely reflected normal fluctuations in loss patterns and normal variability in large case reserves for claims above 2 million.

 Private Client net written premiums for the respective periods included excess and surplus lines homeowner policies with premiums totaling 46 million in the third quarter and 131 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 34 million in the third quarter and 85 million in the first nine months of 2023. The table below analyzes the primary components of premiums. 
 Agency renewal written premiums increased 28 and 27 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, reflecting rate increases in selected states, a higher level of insured exposures and other factors such as changes in policy deductibles or mix of business. Part of the insured exposure increase reflects our response to inflation effects that increase the cost of building materials used to repair damaged homes. 
 We estimate that premium rates for our personal auto line of business increased at average percentages in the low-double-digit range during the first nine months of 2024. For our homeowner line of business, we estimate that premium rates for the first nine months of 2024 increased at average percentages in the high-single-digit range. For both our personal auto and homeowner lines of business, some individual policies experienced lower or higher rate changes based on each risk's specific characteristics and enhanced pricing precision enabled by predictive models. 
 Personal lines new business written premiums increased 43 million or 35 for the third quarter of 2024, compared with the same period of 2023, including approximately 18 million from Cincinnati Private Client policies and 25 million from middle-market policies. For the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same period of 2023, personal lines new business written premiums increased 143 million or 47 , including approximately 58 million from Cincinnati Private Client policies and 85 million from middle-market policies. We believe we maintained underwriting and pricing discipline across all personal lines markets as we expanded use of enhanced pricing precision tools. 
 Other written premiums include premiums ceded to reinsurers as part of our reinsurance ceded program. For our personal lines insurance segment, an increase in 2024 ceded premiums reduced net written premiums by approximately 10 million and 20 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023.

 Combined ratio Our personal lines combined ratio for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 10.4 percentage points, compared with third-quarter 2023, primarily due to an increase of 12.7 points in losses from catastrophes. The third-quarter 2024 combined ratio also included a decrease of 2.3 percentage points from current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses, including an increase of 5.0 points for the IBNR portion and a decrease of 7.3 points for the case incurred portion. For the first nine months of 2024, the combined ratio improved by 2.3 percentage points, compared with the same period a year ago, including no change in the net ratio for losses from catastrophes. The nine-month 2024 combined ratio also included a decrease of 2.9 points from current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses, including an increase of 2.1 points in the IBNR portion and a decrease of 5.0 points for the case incurred portion. Those current accident year ratios were measured as of September 30 of the respective years and included a decrease of 1.6 percentage points for the first nine months of 2024 in the ratio for large losses of 2 million or more per claim, discussed below. 
 When estimating the ultimate cost of total loss and loss expenses, we consider many factors, including trends in inflation, historical paid and reported losses, large loss activity and other data or information for the industry or our company. Elevated inflation in recent years has been a driver of higher losses and loss expenses as costs have increased significantly to repair damaged autos or homes that we insure. Due to increased uncertainty

 regarding ultimate losses, we intend to remain prudent in reserving for estimated ultimate losses until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. 
 Catastrophe losses and loss expenses accounted for 26.6 and 19.2 percentage points of the combined ratio for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with 13.9 and 19.2 points for the same periods a year ago. The 10-year annual average catastrophe loss ratio for the personal lines segment through 2023 was 11.4 percentage points, and the five-year annual average was 13.2 percentage points. 
 In addition to the average rate increases discussed above, we continue to refine our pricing to better match premiums to the risk of loss on individual policies. Improved pricing precision and broad-based rate increases are expected to help position the combined ratio at a profitable level over the long term. In addition, greater geographic diversification is expected to reduce the volatility of homeowner loss ratios attributable to weather-related catastrophe losses over time. 
 The net effect of reserve development on prior accident years during the third quarter of 2024 was unfavorable by less than 1 million but favorable by 27 million for the first nine months of 2024 for personal lines overall, compared with 8 million and 54 million of favorable development for the same periods of 2023. Our homeowner line of business was the primary contributor to the personal lines net favorable reserve development for the first nine months of 2024. The net favorable reserve development was primarily due to lower-than-anticipated loss emergence on known claims. Reserve estimates are inherently uncertain as described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves, Page 53. 
 The personal lines underwriting expense ratio decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods a year ago. The decreases were primarily due to premium growth outpacing growth in various expenses. The ratios also included ongoing expense management efforts.

 We continue to monitor new losses and case reserve increases greater than 2 million for trends in factors such as initial reserve levels, loss cost inflation and claim settlement expenses. Our analysis continues to indicate no unexpected concentration of these large losses and case reserve increases by risk category, geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. In the third quarter of 2024, the personal lines total large loss ratio, net of reinsurance, was 3.3 percentage points lower than last year's third quarter. The decrease in personal lines total large losses incurred for the first nine months of 2024 occurred primarily for our homeowner line of business. The third-quarter 2024 amount of total large losses incurred helped contribute to the decrease in the

 nine-month 2024 total large loss ratio, compared with 2023, in addition to a first-half 2024 ratio that was 1.6 points lower than the first half of 2023. We believe results for the three- and nine-month periods largely reflected normal fluctuations in loss patterns and normal variability in large case reserves for claims above 2 million.

 Overview 
 Performance highlights for the excess and surplus lines segment include: 
 Premiums Excess and surplus lines earned premiums and net written premiums continued to grow during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods a year ago, including increases in both agency renewal and new business written premiums. Renewal written premiums rose 22 for the third quarter and 16 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, largely due to higher renewal pricing. For both 2024 periods, excess and surplus lines policy renewals experienced estimated average price increases at percentages in the high-single-digit range. We measure average changes in excess and surplus lines renewal pricing as the percentage rate of change in renewal premium for the new policy period compared with the premium for the expiring policy period, assuming no change in the level of insured exposures or policy coverage between those periods for respective policies. 
 New business written premiums produced by agencies increased by 26 for the third quarter and 14 for the first nine months of 2024 compared with the same periods of 2023, as we continued to carefully underwrite each policy in a highly competitive market. Some of what we report as new business came from accounts that were not new to our agents. We believe our agents' seasoned accounts tend to be priced more accurately than business that may be less familiar to them.

 Combined ratio The excess and surplus lines combined ratio increased by 4.8 percentage points for the third quarter and 3.4 points for the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023. The increases were largely due to unfavorable reserve development on prior accident year loss and loss expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a smaller amount of unfavorable reserve development for third-quarter 2023 and favorable reserve development for the first nine months of 2023. Higher catastrophe losses for both 2024 periods also contributed to the combined ratio increases. 
 The 64.2 third-quarter 2024 ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses was 0.6 percentage points lower, compared with the 64.8 accident year 2023 ratio measured as of September 30, 2023, including an increase of 2.7 points for the IBNR portion and a decrease of 3.3 points for the case incurred portion. The 64.6 nine-month 2024 ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses was 3.3 percentage points lower, compared with the 67.9 accident year 2023 ratio measured as of September 30, 2023, including a decrease of 5.3 points for the IBNR portion and an increase of 2.0 points for the case incurred portion. 
 Excess and surplus lines net reserve development on prior accident years, as a ratio to earned premiums, was unfavorable by 2.7 for the third quarter and 1.0 for the first nine months of 2024, compared with unfavorable 0.7 for third-quarter 2023 and favorable 3.5 for the first nine months of 2023. Reserve estimates are inherently uncertain as described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves, Page 53. 
 The excess and surplus lines underwriting expense ratio increased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods a year ago. The increases were largely due to increases in profit-sharing commissions for agencies and employee-related expenses. The ratio for both periods also benefited from ongoing expense management efforts and premium growth.

 Overview 
 Performance highlights for the life insurance segment include: 
 Revenues Revenues increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period a year ago, driven by higher earned premiums from term life insurance, our largest life insurance product line. 
 Net in-force life insurance policy face amounts increased 2 to 83.664 billion at September 30, 2024, from 82.361 billion at year-end 2023. 
 Fixed annuity deposits received for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 10 million and 29 million, compared with 13 million and 38 million for the same periods of 2023. Fixed annuity deposits have a minimal impact to earned premiums because deposits received are initially recorded as liabilities. Profit is earned over time by way of interest rate spreads. We do not write variable or equity-indexed annuities.

 Profitability Our life insurance segment typically reports a smaller profit compared with the life insurance subsidiary because profits from investment income spreads are included in our investments segment results. We include only investment income credited to contract holders (including interest assumed in life insurance policy reserve calculations) in our life insurance segment results. A profit of 42 million for our life insurance segment in the first nine months of 2024, compared with a profit of 38 million for the same period of 2023, was primarily due to more favorable mortality experience. 
 
 Life insurance segment benefits and expenses consist principally of contract holders' (policyholders') benefits incurred related to traditional life and interest-sensitive products and operating expenses incurred, net of deferred acquisition costs. Total benefits decreased in the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to more favorable mortality experience. 
 
 Underwriting expenses for the first nine months of 2024 increased compared with the same period a year ago, largely due to higher general insurance expense levels compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 We recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluating the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products.

 On a basis that includes investment income and investment gains or losses from life-insurance-related invested assets, the life insurance subsidiary reported net income of 20 million and 63 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 25 million and 65 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The life insurance subsidiary portfolio had net after-tax investment losses of less than 1 million and 7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with less than 1 million of net after-tax gains and 1 million of net after-tax investment losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

INVESTMENTS RESULTS 
 
 Overview 
 The investments segment contributes investment income and investment gains and losses to results of operations. Investments traditionally are our primary source of pretax and after-tax profits. 
 
 Investment Income 
 Pretax investment income grew 15 for the third quarter and 14 for the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023. Interest income increased by 33 million and 88 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as net purchases of fixed-maturity securities in recent quarters and higher bond yields are working to generally offset effects of the low interest rate environment of the past several years. Net purchases of fixed-maturity securities totaled 672 million for the third quarter and 1.443 billion for the first nine months of 2024. Sales of selected equity securities, discussed below, contributed to the relatively larger amount of third-quarter 2024 net purchases as proceeds from those sales were reinvested in fixed-maturity securities. Bond purchases in the third quarter helped increase the yield of the overall investment portfolio as we target what we believe to be optimal risk-adjusted after-tax yields. Dividend income decreased by 1 million in the third quarter and increased by 4 million for the first nine months of 2024. In addition to dividend rates generally increasing more slowly in recent quarters, net sales of equity securities totaled 959 million for the third quarter and 1.050 billion for the first nine months of 2024. Most of the equity security sales involved trimming or exiting positions for selected common stocks. Minor asset allocation adjustments in our equity portfolio in recent quarters partially offset other factors that unfavorably affected dividend income. Our investment approach remains the same as we focus on balancing near-term income generation with long-term book value growth potential.

 We continue to consider the low interest rate environment that prevailed in recent years as well as the potential for a continuation of both elevated inflation and higher bond yields as we position our portfolio. As bonds in our generally laddered portfolio mature or are called over the near term, we will reinvest with a balanced approach, keeping in mind our long-term strategy and pursuing attractive risk-adjusted after-tax yields. The table below shows the average pretax yield-to-amortized cost associated with expected principal redemptions for our fixed-maturity portfolio. The expected principal redemptions are based on par amounts and include dated maturities, calls and prefunded municipal bonds that we expect will be called during each respective time period.

 The table below shows the average pretax yield-to-amortized cost for fixed-maturity securities acquired during the periods indicated. The average yield for total fixed-maturity securities acquired during the first nine months of 2024 was higher than the 4.60 average yield-to-amortized cost of the fixed-maturity securities portfolio at the end of 2023. Our fixed-maturity portfolio's average yield of 4.63 for the first nine months of 2024, from the investment income table below, was also higher than the 4.60 yield for the year-end 2023 fixed-maturities portfolio.

 While our bond portfolio more than covers our insurance reserve liabilities, we believe our diversified common stock portfolio of mainly blue chip, dividend-paying companies represents one of our best investment opportunities for the long term. We discussed our portfolio strategies in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 21, and Item 7, Investments Outlook, Page 91. We discuss risks related to our investment income and our fixed-maturity and equity investment portfolios in this quarterly report Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

 Total Investment Gains and Losses 
 Investment gains and losses are recognized on the sale of investments, for certain changes in fair values of securities even though we continue to hold the securities or as otherwise required by GAAP. The change in fair value for equity securities still held is included in investment gains and losses and also in net income. The change in unrealized gains or losses for fixed-maturity securities is included as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI). Accounting requirements for the allowance for credit losses for the fixed-maturity portfolio are disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 8, Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Page 128.

 Of the 4,988 fixed-maturity securities in the portfolio, five securities were trading below 70 of amortized cost at September 30, 2024. Our asset impairment committee regularly monitors the portfolio, including a quarterly review of the entire portfolio for potential credit losses. We believe that if liquidity in the markets were to significantly deteriorate or economic conditions were to significantly weaken, we could experience declines in portfolio values and possibly increases in the allowance for credit losses or write-downs to fair value.

 OTHER 
 We report as Other the noninvestment operations of the parent company and a noninsurance subsidiary, CFC Investment Company. We also report as Other the underwriting results of Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, including earned premiums, loss and loss expenses and underwriting expenses in the table below. 
 
 Total revenues for the first nine months of 2024 for our Other operations increased, compared with the same period of 2023, primarily due to earned premiums from Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, with increases of 5 million and 10 million, respectively. Cincinnati Re had 411 million of earned premiums for the first nine months of 2024 and generated an underwriting profit of 76 million. Cincinnati Global had 203 million of earned premiums for the first nine months of 2024 and generated an underwriting profit of 68 million. Total expenses for Other decreased for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to lower loss and loss expenses from Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global. 
 
 Other income in the table below represents profit before income taxes. For all periods shown, total other income was driven by underwriting profit from Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global.

TAXES 
 We had 220 million and 492 million of income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 49 million of income tax benefit and 126 million of income tax expense for the same periods of 2023. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 21.2 and 20.7 compared with 33.1 and 16.0 for the same periods last year. The change in our effective tax rate between periods was primarily due to large changes in our net investment gains and losses included in income for the periods and changes in underwriting income and investment income. 
 
 Historically, we have pursued a strategy of investing some portion of cash flow in tax-advantaged fixed-maturity and equity securities to minimize our overall tax liability and maximize after-tax earnings. See Tax-Exempt Fixed Maturities in this quarterly report Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion on municipal bond purchases in our fixed-maturity investment portfolio. For tax years after 2017, for our property casualty insurance subsidiaries, approximately 75 of interest from tax-advantaged, fixed-maturity investments and approximately 40 of dividends from qualified equities are exempt from federal tax after applying proration. For our noninsurance companies, the dividend received deduction exempts 50 of dividends from qualified equities. Our life insurance company does not own tax-advantaged, fixed-maturity investments or equities subject to the dividend received deduction. Details about our effective tax rate are in this quarterly report Item 1, Note 9, Income Taxes.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 At September 30, 2024, shareholders' equity was 13.804 billion, compared with 12.098 billion at December 31, 2023. Total debt was 815 million at September 30, 2024, unchanged from December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 1.752 billion, compared with 907 million at December 31, 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, net sales of equity securities were 959 million, primarily from trimming or exiting positions for selected common stocks. Proceeds from the sales of those equity securities were used to purchase fixed maturities during the third quarter of 2024, with plans to purchase additional fixed maturities in the fourth quarter of 2024, thereby reducing our cash balance at September 30, 2024. 
 
 In addition to our historically positive operating cash flow to meet the needs of operations, we have the ability to slow investing activities or sell a portion of our high-quality, liquid investment portfolio if such need arises. We also have additional capacity to borrow on our revolving short-term line of credit, as described further below. 
 
 SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY 
 
 Subsidiary Dividends 
 Our lead insurance subsidiary declared dividends of 290 million to the parent company in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 426 million for the same period of 2023. For full-year 2023, our lead insurance subsidiary paid dividends totaling 526 million to the parent company. State of Ohio regulatory requirements restrict the dividends our insurance subsidiary can pay. For full-year 2024, total dividends that our insurance subsidiary can pay to our parent company without regulatory approval are approximately 729 million. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Investment income is a source of liquidity for both the parent company and its insurance subsidiaries. We continue to focus on portfolio strategies to balance near-term income generation and long-term book value growth. 
 
 Parent company obligations can be funded with income on investments held at the parent-company level or through sales of securities in that portfolio, although our investment philosophy seeks to compound cash flows over the long term. These sources of capital can help minimize subsidiary dividends to the parent company, protecting insurance subsidiary capital. 
 
 For a discussion of our historic investment strategy, portfolio allocation and quality, see our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 21. 
 
 Insurance Underwriting 
 Our property casualty and life insurance underwriting operations provide liquidity because we generally receive premiums before paying losses under the policies purchased with those premiums. After satisfying our cash requirements, we use excess cash flows for investment, increasing future investment income. 
 
 Historically, cash receipts from property casualty and life insurance premiums, along with investment income, have been more than sufficient to pay claims, operating expenses and dividends to the parent company. 
 
 The table below shows a summary of the operating cash flow for property casualty insurance (direct method): 
 (Dollars in millions) Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Premiums collected 2,343 2,025 16 6,593 5,806 14 Loss and loss expenses paid (1,114) (1,058) (5) (3,218) (3,185) (1) Commissions and other underwriting expenses paid (585) (516) (13) (2,008) (1,772) (13) Cash flow from underwriting 644 451 43 1,367 849 61 Investment income received 192 151 27 533 447 19 Cash flow from operations 836 602 39 1,900 1,296 47

Table of Contents 

 Collected premiums for property casualty insurance rose 787 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same period in 2023. Loss and loss expenses paid for the 2024 period increased 33 million. Commissions and other underwriting expenses paid increased 236 million. 
 
 We discuss our future obligations for claims payments and for underwriting expenses in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 7, Obligations, Page 97. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 At September 30, 2024, our debt-to-total-capital ratio was 5.6 , considerably below our 35 covenant threshold, with 790 million in long-term debt and 25 million in borrowing on our revolving short-term line of credit. At September 30, 2024, 275 million was available for future cash management needs as part of the general provisions of the line of credit agreement, with another 300 million available as part of an accordion feature. Based on our capital requirements at September 30, 2024, we do not anticipate a material increase in debt levels exceeding the available line of credit amount during the year. As a result, we expect changes in our debt-to-total-capital ratio to continue to be largely a function of the contribution of unrealized investment gains or losses to shareholders' equity. On September 12, 2024, we terminated our unsecured letter of credit agreement, which provided a portion of the capital needed to support Cincinnati Global's obligations at Lloyd's. The amount of the unsecured letter of credit agreement was 94 million, with no amount drawn. We replaced the letter of credit agreement with common equities, bringing total common equities held in Lloyd's trust accounts to 219 million. 
 
 We provide details of our three long-term notes in this quarterly report Item 1, Note 3, Fair Value Measurements. None of the notes are encumbered by rating triggers. 
 
 Four independent ratings firms award insurer financial strength ratings to our property casualty insurance companies and three firms rate our life insurance company. Those firms made no changes to our parent company debt ratings during the first nine months of 2024. On October 16, 2024, Fitch Ratings revised our Rating Outlook to Positive from Stable for all ratings. Our debt ratings are discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 7, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Long-Term Debt, Page 96. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not use any special-purpose financing vehicles or have any undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in applicable SEC rules) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the company's financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Similarly, the company holds no fair-value contracts for which a lack of marketplace quotations would necessitate the use of fair-value techniques. 
 
 USES OF LIQUIDITY 
 Our parent company and insurance subsidiary have contractual obligations and other commitments. In addition, one of our primary uses of cash is to enhance shareholder return. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We estimated our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023, in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 7, Contractual Obligations, Page 97. There have been no material changes to our estimates of future contractual obligations since our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Other Commitments 
 In addition to our contractual obligations, we have other property casualty operational commitments: 
 Commissions Commissions paid were 1.310 billion in the first nine months of 2024. Commission payments generally track with written premiums, except for annual profit-sharing commissions typically paid during the first quarter of the year. 
 Other underwriting expenses Many of our underwriting expenses are not contractual obligations, but reflect the ongoing expenses of our business. Noncommission underwriting expenses paid were 698 million in the first nine months of 2024. 
 There were no contributions to our qualified pension plan during the first nine months of 2024.

 Investing Activities 
 After fulfilling operating requirements, we invest cash flows from underwriting, investment and other corporate activities in fixed-maturity and equity securities on an ongoing basis to help achieve our portfolio objectives. We discuss our investment strategy and certain portfolio attributes in this quarterly report Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Uses of Capital 
 Uses of cash to enhance shareholder return include dividends to shareholders and shares acquired under our repurchase program. In January 2024, the board of directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of 81 cents per share for an indicated annual rate of 3.24 per share. During the first nine months of 2024, we used 365 million to pay cash dividends to shareholders. 

PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVES 
 For the business lines in the commercial and personal lines insurance segments, and in total for the excess and surplus lines insurance segment and other property casualty insurance operations, the following table details gross reserves among case, IBNR (incurred but not reported) and loss expense reserves, net of salvage and subrogation reserves. Reserving practices are discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 7, Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Obligations and Reserves, Page 98. 
 
 Total gross reserves at September 30, 2024, increased 891 million compared with December 31, 2023. Case loss reserves decreased by 9 million, IBNR loss reserves increased by 794 million and loss expense reserves increased by 106 million. The total gross increase was primarily due to our commercial casualty and homeowner lines of business and also our excess and surplus lines insurance segment.

Management discussed the development and selection of those accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our greatest exposure to market risk is through our investment portfolio. Market risk is the potential for a decrease in securities' fair value resulting from broad yet uncontrollable forces such as: inflation, economic growth or recession, interest rates, world political conditions or other widespread unpredictable events. It is comprised of many individual risks that, when combined, create a macroeconomic impact. 
 
 Our view of potential risks and our sensitivity to such risks is discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Page 113. 
 
 The fair value of our investment portfolio was 27.441 billion at September 30, 2024, up 2.661 billion from year-end 2023, including a 2.080 billion increase in the fixed-maturity portfolio and a 581 million increase in the equity portfolio.

 FIXED-MATURITY SECURITIES INVESTMENTS 
 By maintaining a well-diversified fixed-maturity portfolio, we attempt to reduce overall risk. We invest new money in the bond market on a regular basis, targeting what we believe to be optimal risk-adjusted, after-tax yields. Risk, in this context, includes interest rate, call, reinvestment rate, credit and liquidity risk. We do not make a concerted effort to alter duration on a portfolio basis in response to anticipated movements in interest rates. By regularly investing in the bond market, we build a broad, diversified portfolio that we believe mitigates the impact of adverse economic factors. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, the increase in fair value of our fixed-maturity portfolio was due to net purchases of securities, plus a decrease in our net unrealized loss position that reflected realized losses from the sales of some lower-yielding bonds, as well as a decrease in U.S. Treasury yields in addition to tightening of corporate credit spreads. At September 30, 2024, our fixed-maturity portfolio with an average rating of A2/A was valued at 98.7 of its amortized cost, compared with 96.0 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our investment-grade fixed-maturity securities represented 97.4 of the portfolio based on ratings provided by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations or the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. 
 
 Attributes of the fixed-maturity portfolio include: 
 At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Weighted average yield-to-amortized cost 4.98 4.60 Weighted average maturity 9.5 yrs 7.9 yrs Effective duration 4.6 yrs 4.3 yrs 
 
 We discuss maturities of our fixed-maturity portfolio in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 8, Note 2, Investments, Page 137, and in this quarterly report Item 2, Investments Results.

 TAXABLE FIXED MATURITIES 
 Our taxable fixed-maturity portfolio, with a fair value of 11.882 billion at September 30, 2024, included: 
 (Dollars in millions) At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Investment-grade corporate 8,010 7,040 States, municipalities and political subdivisions 820 801 Noninvestment-grade corporate 329 412 Government-sponsored enterprises 2,151 1,224 Asset-backed 314 187 United States government 227 200 Foreign government 31 25 Total 11,882 9,889 
 
 Our strategy is to buy, and typically hold, fixed-maturity investments to maturity, but we monitor credit profiles and fair value movements when determining holding periods for individual securities. With the exception of United States agency issues that include government-sponsored enterprises, no individual issuer's securities accounted for more than 0.9 of the taxable fixed-maturity portfolio at September 30, 2024. Our investment-grade corporate bonds had an average rating of Baa1 by Moody's or BBB+ by S P Global Ratings and represented 67.4 of the taxable fixed-maturity portfolio's fair value at September 30, 2024, compared with 71.2 at year-end 2023. 
 
 The heaviest concentration in our investment-grade corporate bond portfolio, based on fair value at 
 September 30, 2024, was the financial sector. It represented 35.6 of our investment-grade corporate bond portfolio, compared with 38.2 at year-end 2023. The utility and energy sectors represented 12.5 and 10.6 , compared with less than 10 and 11.2 , respectively, at year-end 2023. No other sector exceeded 10 of our investment-grade corporate bond portfolio. 
 
 As discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 30, investments in the financial sector include various risks. See risk factors entitled Financial disruption or a prolonged economic downturn could materially and adversely affect our investment performance and Our ability to achieve our performance objectives could be affected by changes in the financial, credit and capital markets or the general economy. 
 
 Our taxable fixed-maturity portfolio at September 30, 2024, included 314 million of asset-backed securities with an average rating of Aa2/AA-. 

TAX-EXEMPT FIXED MATURITIES 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 3.989 billion of tax-exempt fixed-maturity securities with an average rating of Aa2/AA by Moody's and S P Global Ratings. We traditionally have purchased municipal bonds focusing on general obligation and essential services issues, such as water, waste disposal or others. The portfolio is well diversified among approximately 1,800 municipal bond issuers. No single municipal issuer accounted for more than 0.6 of the tax-exempt fixed-maturity portfolio at September 30, 2024. 
 
 INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
 Because of our strong surplus, long-term investment horizon and ability to hold most fixed-maturity investments until maturity, we believe the company is adequately positioned if interest rates were to rise. Although the fair values of our existing holdings may suffer, a higher rate environment would provide the opportunity to invest cash flow in higher-yielding securities, while reducing the likelihood of untimely redemptions of currently callable securities. While higher interest rates would be expected to continue to increase the number of fixed-maturity holdings trading below 100 of amortized cost, we believe lower fixed-maturity security values due solely to interest rate changes would not signal a decline in credit quality. We continue to manage the portfolio with an eye toward both meeting current income needs and managing interest rate risk. 
 
 Our dynamic financial planning model uses analytical tools to assess market risks. As part of this model, the effective duration of the fixed-maturity portfolio is continually monitored by our investment department to evaluate the theoretical impact of interest rate movements. 
 Cincinnati Financial Corporation Third-Quarter 2024 10-Q 
 Page 66 

Table of Contents 

The table below summarizes the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates on the fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio: 
 (Dollars in millions) Effect from interest rate change in basis points -200 -100 100 200 At September 30, 2024 17,326 16,590 15,871 15,107 14,301 At December 31, 2023 14,962 14,375 13,791 13,179 12,543 
 
 The effective duration of the fixed-maturity portfolio as of September 30, 2024, was 4.6 years, up from 4.3 years at the end of 2023. The above table is a theoretical presentation showing that an instantaneous, parallel shift in the yield curve of 100 basis points could produce an approximately 4.7 change in the fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio. Generally speaking, the higher a bond is rated, the more directly correlated movements in its fair value are to changes in the general level of interest rates, exclusive of call features. The fair values of average- to lower-rated corporate bonds are additionally influenced by the expansion or contraction of credit spreads. 
 
 In our dynamic financial planning model, the selected interest rate change of 100 to 200 basis points represents our view of a shift in rates that is quite possible over a one-year period. The rates modeled should not be considered a prediction of future events as interest rates may be much more volatile in the future. The analysis is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in rates on our results or financial condition, nor does it take into account any actions that we might take to reduce exposure to such risks. 

EQUITY INVESTMENTS 
 Our equity investments, with a fair value totaling 11.570 billion at September 30, 2024, included 11.200 billion of common stock securities of companies generally with strong indications of paying and growing their dividends. Other criteria we evaluate include increasing sales and earnings, proven management and a favorable outlook. We believe our equity investment style is an appropriate long-term strategy. While our long-term financial position would be affected by prolonged changes in the market valuation of our investments, we believe our strong surplus position and cash flow provide a cushion against short-term fluctuations in valuation. Continued payment of cash dividends by the issuers of our common equity holdings can provide a floor to their valuation. 
 
 The table below summarizes the effect of hypothetical changes in market prices on fair value of our equity portfolio.

 At September 30, 2024, Apple Inc.(Nasdaq:AAPL) was our largest single common stock holding with a fair value of 885 million, or 7.9 of our publicly traded common stock portfolio and 3.2 of the total investment portfolio. Forty holdings among nine different sectors each had a fair value greater than 100 million.

UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES 
 At September 30, 2024, unrealized investment gains before taxes for the fixed-maturity portfolio totaled 201 million and unrealized investment losses amounted to 404 million before taxes. 
 
 The 203 million net unrealized loss position in our fixed-maturity portfolio at September 30, 2024, decreased in the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to the sale of low-yielding bonds sold at a loss and a decrease in U.S. Treasury yields in addition to tightening of corporate credit spreads. The net loss position for our current fixed-maturity holdings will naturally decline over time as individual securities approach maturity. In addition, changes in interest rates can cause rapid, significant changes in fair values of fixed-maturity securities and the net loss position, as discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 For federal income tax purposes, taxes on gains from appreciated investments generally are not due until securities are sold. We believe that the appreciated value of equity securities, compared with the cost of securities that is generally used as a tax basis, is a useful measure to help evaluate how fair value can change over time. On this basis, the net unrealized investment gains at September 30, 2024, consisted of a net gain position in our equity portfolio of 7.536 billion. Events or factors such as economic growth or recession can affect the fair value and unrealized investment gains of our equity securities. The five largest holdings in our common stock portfolio were Apple, Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT), Broadcom Inc. (Nasdaq:AVGO), UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) and Abbvie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), which had a combined fair value of 3.046 billion. 
 
 Unrealized Investment Losses 
 We expect the number of fixed-maturity securities trading below amortized cost to fluctuate as interest rates rise or fall and credit spreads expand or contract due to prevailing economic conditions. Further, amortized costs for some securities are revised through write-downs recognized in prior periods. At September 30, 2024, 2,495 of the 4,988 fixed-maturity securities we owned had fair values below amortized cost, compared with 2,840 of the 4,738 securities we owned at year-end 2023. The 2,495 holdings with fair values below amortized cost at September 30, 2024, represented 48.7 of the fair value of our fixed-maturity investment portfolio and 404 million in unrealized losses. 
 1,854 of the 2,495 holdings had fair value between 90 and 100 of amortized cost at September 30, 2024. These primarily consist of securities whose current valuation is largely the result of interest rate factors. The fair value of these 1,854 securities was 6.496 billion, and they accounted for 151 million in unrealized losses. 
 636 of the 2,495 fixed-maturity holdings had fair value between 70 and 90 of amortized cost at September 30, 2024. We believe the 636 fixed-maturity securities will continue to pay interest and ultimately

Table of Contents 

 pay principal upon maturity. The issuers of these 636 securities have strong cash flow to service their debt and meet their contractual obligation to make principal payments. The fair value of these securities was 1.217 billion, and they accounted for 247 million in unrealized losses. 
 Five of the 2,495 fixed-maturity holdings had fair value below 70 of amortized cost at September 30, 2024. We believe these fixed-maturity securities will continue to pay interest and ultimately pay principal upon maturity. The fair value of these securities was 11 million, and they accounted for 6 million in unrealized losses. 
 
 The table below reviews fair values and unrealized losses by investment category and by the overall duration of the securities' continuous unrealized loss position.

 At September 30, 2024, applying our invested asset impairment policy, we determined that the total of 404 million, for securities in an unrealized loss position in the table above, was not the result of a credit loss. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, no fixed maturity securities were written down to fair value, due to an intention to be sold. The allowance for credit losses increased 25 million during the first nine months of 2024. During the first nine months of 2023, one fixed-maturity security was written down to fair value, due to an intention to be sold, resulting in 4 million of noncash charges. Changes in allowance for credit losses were 3 million during the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 During the full year of 2023, we wrote down one security and recorded 4 million in impairment charges. At December 31, 2023, 2,840 fixed-maturity securities with a total unrealized loss of 687 million were in an unrealized loss position. Of that total, 20 fixed-maturity securities had fair values below 70 of amortized cost.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)). 
 
 Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The company's management, with the participation of the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company's disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of the company's disclosure controls and procedures provided reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure: 
 that information required to be disclosed in the company's reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and 
 that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
