 and CDPQ ). AES U.S. Investments is owned by AES U.S. Holdings, LLC and CDPQ ). IPALCO owns all of the outstanding common stock of IPL, which does business as AES Indiana. Substantially all of IPALCO s business consists of generating, transmitting, distributing and selling of electric energy conducted through its principal subsidiary, AES Indiana. AES Indiana was incorporated under the laws of the state of Indiana in 1926. AES Indiana has approximately retail customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring cities, towns and communities, and adjacent rural areas all within the state of Indiana. AES Indiana has an exclusive right to provide electric service to those customers. 
 
 AES Indiana owns and operates generating stations, all within the state of Indiana. The first station, Petersburg, is coal-fired, and AES Indiana retired MW Petersburg Unit 1 in May 2021 and MW Petersburg Unit 2 in June 2023, which resulted in MW of total retired economic capacity at this station. AES Indiana plans to convert the remaining two coal units at Petersburg to natural gas (for further discussion, see Note 2, Regulatory Matters - IRP Filings and Replacement Generation ). The second station, Harding Street, consists of three natural gas-fired boilers and steam turbines and uses natural gas and fuel oil to power five combustion turbines. In addition, AES Indiana operates a MW battery energy storage unit at this location, which provides frequency response. The third station, Eagle Valley, is a CCGT natural gas plant. The fourth station, Georgetown, is a peaking station that uses natural gas to power combustion turbines. As of September 30, 2024, AES Indiana s net electric generation capacity at these generating stations for winter is MW and net summer capacity is MW. 
 
 AES Indiana also owns and operates two renewable energy projects, including a MW solar project located in Clinton County, Indiana (the Hardy Hills Solar Project ), which achieved full commercial operations in May 2024, and a MW wind facility located in Benton County, Indiana (the Hoosier Wind Project ), which was acquired in February 2024. See Note 2, " Regulatory Matters - IRP Filings and Replacement Generation" for further information. 
 
 In August 2023, AES Indiana, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the acquisition of Petersburg Energy Center, LLC, including the development of a MW solar and MW MWh) energy storage facility (the Petersburg Energy Center Project ). The Petersburg Energy Center Project is expected to be completed in 2025. 
 
 In June 2023, AES Indiana, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, executed an agreement for the construction of the MW MWh) Pike County BESS Project to be developed at the AES Indiana Petersburg Plant site in Pike County, Indiana. The Pike County BESS Project is expected to be completed in early 2025. 
 
 For further discussion about AES Indiana s plans for wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, please see Note 2, Regulatory Matters - IRP Filings and Replacement Generation to IPALCO s 2023 Form 10-K. 

Interim Financial Presentation 
 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, as contained in the FASB ASC, for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X issued by the SEC. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for annual fiscal reporting periods. In the opinion of management, the interim financial information includes all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of expected results for the year ending December

Current period provision Net write-offs charged against allowance 
 ) ) Recoveries collected Ending Balance 
 
 The allowance for credit losses primarily relates to utility customer receivables, including unbilled amounts. Expected credit loss estimates are developed by disaggregating customers into those with similar credit risk characteristics and using historical credit loss experience. In addition, we also consider how current and future economic conditions are expected to impact the collectability, as applicable, of our receivables balance. Amounts are written off when reasonable collections efforts have been exhausted. During 2024, the current period provision and allowance for credit losses has increased due to higher past due customer receivables. AES Indiana temporarily paused customer disconnections and certain collection efforts and write-off processes after the implementation of AES Indiana's customer billing system upgrade in the fourth quarter of 2023. This has resulted in higher past due customer receivables and a higher allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024. AES Indiana currently anticipates reinstituting the customer disconnections process and collection efforts and write-off processes in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 ARO liabilities incurred in 2024 primarily relate to decommissioning costs for AES Indiana s renewable projects, including liabilities incurred through acquisition of Hoosier Wind Project, LLC. AES Indiana recorded revisions to its ARO liabilities in 2024 primarily to reflect revisions to cash flow estimates due to increases in closure costs and groundwater treatment measures for ash ponds and landfills. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, AES Indiana did not have any assets that are legally restricted for settling its ARO liability.

 Storm Outage Restoration Inquiry 
 
 On July 11, 2023, the OUCC and the CAC filed a Joint Petition through which they requested the IURC open an investigation into AES Indiana s practices and procedures regarding storm outage restoration. A technical conference was held on October 2, 2023, to discuss AES Indiana s response to outages and storm restoration; particularly the storms that occurred between June 29, 2023 and July 2, 2023. In its 2024 Base Rate Order, the IURC stated, "The uncontested evidence established that AES Indiana s response to the June 29 storm was equal to or better than the response provided by other utilities, as evidenced by a comparison of storm response with the information other utilities provided at a September 28, 2023 technical conference regarding their respective response. The evidence also established that the priorities used to guide each utility s restoration efforts and overall effort were the same." Contemporaneous with the 2024 Base Rate Order, this Joint Petition was dismissed with prejudice. 
 
 DSM 
 
 AES Indiana filed a petition with the IURC on May 31, 2024 asking for approval of a two year DSM plan for the 2025-2026 program years. The petition includes requested recovery of program operating costs as well as net lost revenue and financial incentives, depending on the level of success of the programs consistent with prior DSM

 On March 11, 2024, AES Indiana filed for approval of a CPCN with the IURC to convert Petersburg Units 3 and 4 from coal to natural gas and to recover costs through future rates. The conversion of Unit 3 is expected to begin in February 2026 and be completed by June 2026 and the conversion of Unit 4 is expected to begin in June 2026 and be completed by December 2026. An evidentiary hearing on this matter was held by the IURC on August 6, 2024. We expect the IURC to issue an order on this proceeding in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Hardy Hills Solar Project 
 
 In December 2023, the first stage of construction for the Hardy Hills Solar Project was completed and placed in service, with initial operations for over half of the project commencing on December 28, 2023. Construction was completed for the remaining MW and the project achieved full commercial operations in May 2024. Upon the final stage of the project being placed in service, the Company recognized million of earnings from tax attributes using the HLBV method. 
 
 Hoosier Wind Project 
 
 In August 2023, AES Indiana filed for IURC issuance of a CPCN approving the acquisition of of the membership interests in Hoosier Wind Project, LLC (the Hoosier Wind Project ), which is an existing MW wind facility located in Benton County, Indiana. IURC approval was received on January 24, 2024, and the transaction closed on February 29, 2024. Immediately following the acquisition of the Hoosier Wind Project, the legal entity was dissolved by AES Indiana. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition that did not meet the definition of a business. Of the total consideration transferred of million, including transaction costs, approximately million was allocated to the identifiable assets acquired on a relative fair value basis, primarily consisting of tangible wind farm assets and typical working capital items. The remaining consideration was allocated to the termination of the pre-existing power purchase agreement between AES Indiana and the Hoosier Wind Project, which was deferred as a long-term regulatory asset. 
 
 Crossvine Project 
 
 On August 1, 2024, AES Indiana executed an agreement for the acquisition of a development stage solar and BESS project to be developed in Dubois County, Indiana. AES Indiana plans to build MW of solar and MW MWh) of energy storage which is expected to be completed in mid-2027. This transaction is subject to approval from the IURC. AES Indiana filed a petition and case-in-chief with the IURC in August 2024, seeking a CPCN for this project.

 Debt 
 
 The fair value of our outstanding fixed-rate debt has been determined on the basis of the quoted market prices of the specific securities issued and outstanding. In certain circumstances, the market for such securities was inactive and therefore the valuation was adjusted to consider changes in market spreads for similar securities. Accordingly, the purpose of this disclosure is not to approximate the value on the basis of how the debt might be refinanced.

Cash Flow Hedges 
 
 As part of our risk management processes, we identify the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The fair values of cash flow hedges are determined by current public market prices. IPALCO s three forward-starting interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of million were terminated for total cash proceeds of million, in conjunction with the issuance of the 2034 IPALCO Notes in March 2024. The AOCI associated with the interest rate swaps through the date of the termination will be amortized out of AOCI into interest expense over the 10-year life of the 2034 IPALCO Notes.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge 
 
 AES Indiana s FTRs and forward power contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or the normal purchases and sales exceptions under ASC 815. Accordingly, FTRs are recorded at fair value using the income approach when acquired and subsequently amortized over the annual period as they are used. The forward power contracts are recorded at fair value using the market approach with changes in the fair value charged or credited to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the change occurred. This is commonly referred to as MTM accounting . Realized gains and losses on the forward power contracts are included in future FAC filings, therefore any realized and unrealized gains and losses are deferred as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets. 
 
 Certain qualifying derivative instruments have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts, as provided under GAAP. Derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales under GAAP are not subject to hedge or MTM accounting and are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations on an accrual basis.

The year-to-date rate is different from the combined federal and state statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of taxes on noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries and the net tax expense related to the amortization of allowance for equity funds used during construction, which is partially offset by the flowthrough of the net tax benefit related to the reversal of excess deferred taxes of AES Indiana. 
 
 IPALCO s income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was calculated using the estimated annual effective income tax rate for 2024 of on ordinary income. Management estimates the annual effective tax rate based on its forecast of annual pre-tax income or loss.

IPALCO then received equity capital contributions totaling million, of which million was contributed by AES U.S. Investments and million was contributed by CDPQ. IPALCO then made the same investments in AES Indiana. The proceeds from the equity capital contributions are intended primarily for funding needs related to AES Indiana s capital expenditure program. The equity capital contributions were made on a proportional share basis and, therefore, did not change CDPQ s or AES ownership interests in IPALCO or AES U.S. Investments. 
 
 Equity Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 The Hardy Hills Solar Project has been financed with a tax equity structure, in which a tax equity investor receives a portion of the economic attributes of the facility, including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the project. On December 1, 2023, AES Indiana, through a wholly-owned subsidiary (the "Class B Member"), and a third-party investor (the "Class A Member"), entered into an Equity Capital Contribution Agreement, pursuant to which each member made certain capital contributions to Hardy Hills JV. Through September 30, 2024, the Class A member has made total contributions of million under the agreement, including million contributed in May 2024 upon final completion of the project.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue increased 46.3 million compared to the same period of the prior year, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue decreased 36.0 million compared to the same period of the prior year. These changes were primarily due to the following:

Fuel 
 
 The decreases in fuel costs of 0.6 million and 135.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year were primarily due to the following changes: 
 
 in millions Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Volume: Coal (12.2) (40.4) Natural gas 20.0 42.2 Oil 0.2 Net change in volume 8.0 1.8 Price: Coal 1.5 18.6 Natural gas (16.6) (41.7) Oil 0.1 (0.6) Deferred fuel 6.4 (113.3) Net change in price (8.6) (137.0) Net change in fuel expense (0.6) (135.2) 
 
 The changes in the volume of coal and natural gas are mostly attributed to the retirement of Petersburg Unit 2 in June 2023. The changes in the price of fuel are reflective of market prices for coal and natural gas. We are generally permitted to recover underestimated fuel and purchased power costs to serve our retail customers in future rates through quarterly FAC proceedings. These variances are deferred when incurred and amortized into expense in the same period that our rates are adjusted to reflect these variances. Additionally, fuel and purchased power costs incurred for wholesale energy sales are considered in the Off System Sales Margin rider. 
 
 Power Purchased 
 
 The decreases in power purchased of 4.6 million and 8.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year were primarily due to the following changes: 
 
 in millions Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Volume: Net (decrease) / increase in the volume of power purchased primarily due to AES Indiana's generation units running (more) / less frequently during the respective periods, and the impact of acquiring the Hoosier Wind Project in the first quarter of 2024. 
 (8.1) 3.9 Price: Market prices 
 1.9 9.4 Deferred purchased power 
 5.5 (24.4) Net change in price 7.4 (15.0) Other, net (mostly due to changes in capacity purchases) 
 (3.9) 2.5 Net change in power purchased costs (4.6) (8.6) 
 36 

The volume of power purchased each period is primarily influenced by retail demand, generating unit capacity and outages, and the relative cost of producing power versus purchasing power in the market. The market price of purchased power is influenced primarily by changes in the market price of delivered fuel (primarily natural gas), the supply of and demand for electricity, and the time of day during which power is purchased. 
 
 Operation and Maintenance 
 
 The increase / (decrease) in Operation and maintenance of 5.0 million and (6.1) million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year were primarily due to the following changes: 
 
 in millions Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Decrease in contracted services expenses, and lower materials and supplies inventory consumption, primarily due to lower generation maintenance and outage costs 
 (6.0) (22.2) Increase in charges from the Service Company 
 5.0 10.3 Increase due to higher expected credit losses 
 7.9 8.5 Other, net (1.9) (2.7) Net change in operation and maintenance costs 5.0 (6.1) 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 The increases in Depreciation and amortization expense of 13.5 million and 36.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year were mostly attributed to the impact of additional assets placed in service, higher amortization of regulatory assets and changes in depreciation rates as a result of the 2024 Base Rate Order. 
 
 Other (Expense) / Income, Net 
 
 The following table illustrates our changes in Other (expense) / income, net during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 (in thousands): 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Other (expense) / income, net 
 Allowance for equity funds used during construction 1,485 3,134 (1,649) (52.6) 3,585 7,089 (3,504) (49.4) Interest expense (44,198) (34,471) (9,727) 28.2 (131,681) (104,510) (27,171) 26.0 Other income / (expense), net 
 484 (633) 1,117 (176.5) (266) 787 (1,053) (133.8) Total other expense, net 
 (42,229) (31,970) (10,259) 32.1 (128,362) (96,634) (31,728) 32.8 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 The increases in Interest expense of 9.7 million and 27.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year were primarily due to (i) higher interest expense on debt of 13.0 million and 37.3 million, respectively, mostly due to new debt issuances and higher borrowings on the committed Credit Agreement, partially offset by (ii) an increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction of 3.6 million and 9.6 million, respectively. 

37 

Income Tax Expense 
 
 The following table illustrates our changes in Income tax expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year (in thousands): 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Income tax expense 8,314 3,802 4,512 118.7 24,833 8,663 16,170 186.7 
 
 The increases in Income tax expense of 4.5 million and 16.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year were primarily driven by higher pre-tax income, a decrease in the net tax benefit related to the reversal of excess deferred taxes of AES Indiana resulting from the 2024 Base Rate Order, and the tax effects associated with HLBV in the current period; partially offset by the reversal of certain excess deferred taxes which are not probable to cause a reduction in future base customer rates. 
 
 Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 The following table illustrates changes in Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year (in thousands): 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (872) (872) (100.0) (24,171) (24,171) (100.0) 
 
 The Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of 0.9 million and 24.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, relates to the allocation of earnings using the HLBV method for the Hardy Hills Solar Project, which began initial operations in December 2023 and achieved full commercial operations in May 2024. See Note 2, Regulatory Matters - IRP Filings and Replacement Generation - Hardy Hills Solar Project to the Financial Statements included in IPALCO s 2023 Form 10-K for more information. 

KEY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
 
 During the remainder of 2024 and beyond, we expect that our financial results will be driven primarily by retail demand, weather and maintenance costs. In addition, our financial results will likely be driven by many other factors including, but not limited to: 
 
 regulatory outcomes and impacts; 
 the passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations or other changes in regulation; and 
 timely recovery of capital expenditures and operation and maintenance costs. 
 
 If favorable outcomes related to these factors do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, then these factors, or other factors unknown to us, may impact our operating margin, net income and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For a discussion of the risks related to our business, see Item 1. Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors as described in IPALCO s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Operational 
 
 Trade Restrictions and Supply Chain 
 
 On April 1, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce Commerce initiated an investigation into whether imports into the U.S. of solar cells and panels imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam Southeast Asia are circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty AD/CVD orders on solar cells and panels from China. 
 38 

This investigation resulted in significant systemic disruptions to the import of solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia. On June 6, 2022, President Biden issued a Proclamation waiving any circumvention duties on imported solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia that result from this investigation for a 24-month period ending June 6, 2024. Suppliers resumed importing cells and panels from Southeast Asia into the U.S. pursuant to a Commerce certification regime implementing the Proclamation. 
 
 On December 2, 2022, Commerce issued country-wide affirmative preliminary determinations that circumvention had occurred in each of the four Southeast Asian countries. Commerce also evaluated numerous individual companies and issued preliminary determinations that circumvention had occurred with respect to several but not all of these companies. Additionally, Commerce issued a preliminary determination that circumvention would not be deemed to occur for any solar cells and panels imported from the four countries if the wafers comprising the cells and panels were manufactured outside of China or if no more than two out of six specifically identified panel components were produced in China. On August 23, 2023, Commerce published its final determinations and affirmed its preliminary findings in most respects. Commerce found that three of the specific companies it investigated were not circumventing. Several parties have challenged Commerce s circumvention final determinations before the U.S. Court of International Trade CIT ), arguing that the determinations were not supported by substantial evidence or otherwise rendered in accordance with governing law. 
 
 On December 29, 2023, Auxin Solar and Concept Clean Energy filed a lawsuit before CIT, challenging certain aspects of the final rule promulgated by Commerce to implement the Proclamation. The lawsuit specifically challenges Commerce s decisions not to suspend the final disposition of certain entries of imported solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia made prior to June 6, 2024, and not to collect AD/CVD deposits with respect to those entries. Certain U.S. developers, associations, and foreign solar producers have intervened in the case to support Commerce s final rule. The CIT denied motions to dismiss filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, and the defendant-intervenors, and on July 22, 2024 plaintiffs filed their opening brief on the merits. 
 
 On April 24, 2024, new Commerce regulations with respect to the administration of AD/CVD cases went into effect, including regulations pertaining to transnational subsidization and particular market situations. On the same day, several companies filed a petition requesting that Commerce initiate an investigation into whether new AD/CVD duties should be imposed on cells and modules imported from Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam. These petitions cover exports of cells and panels from Southeast Asia that are not otherwise subject to the Commerce circumvention determinations. On May 14, 2024, Commerce initiated new AD/CVD investigations with respect to all four countries, and the U.S. International Trade Commission preliminarily voted to continue its investigations on June 7, 2024. On October 4, 2024, Commerce published its CVD preliminary determinations, establishing CVD cash deposit requirements, which may be applied retroactively with respect to Thailand and Vietnam. Commerce is scheduled to announce its AD preliminary determinations in these investigations in late November of 2024. The U.S. International Trade Commission will conduct its final injury investigation with respect to these exports from Southeast Asia in the first half of 2025. If the Commerce and U.S. International Trade Commission investigations result in Commerce issuing AD/CVD orders, the orders are likely to be imposed in the second or third quarter of 2025. 
 
 Separately, the U.S. maintains a global tariff (currently 14.25 ad valorem) on solar cells and modules pursuant to the Section 201 Safeguard Action on crystalline silicon photovoltaic products, which became effective in February 2018. On June 21, 2024, President Biden issued Proclamation 10779, revoking the exclusion of bifacial panels from safeguard relief previously proclaimed in Proclamation 10339, and reinstating bifacial panels under the Section 201 Safeguard Action, subject to certain qualifications. 
 
 Additionally, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act UFLPA seeks to block the import of products made with forced labor in certain areas of China, at any point in the supply chain, and may lead to certain suppliers being blocked from importing solar cells and panels to the U.S . While this has impacted the U.S. market, we have managed this issue without significant impact to our projects. Further disruptions may impact our suppliers ability or willingness to meet their contractual agreements or to continue to supply cells or panels into the U.S. market on terms that we deem satisfactory. 
 
 While we have executed agreements for AES Indiana s existing solar projects that mitigate these risks, further disruptions may impact our suppliers ability or willingness to meet their contractual agreements with respect to these projects on terms that we deem satisfactory and these and future disruptions may impact the availability or costs of future projects. The impact of new Commerce investigations or any adverse Commerce determinations or 
 39 

other tariff disputes or litigation, the impact of the UFLPA, potential future disruptions to the solar panel supply chain and their effect on AES Indiana s solar project development and construction activities remain uncertain. AES Indiana will continue to monitor developments and take prudent steps towards managing our renewable projects. 
 
 Capital Projects 
 
 Our construction projects have experienced some indications of delays and price increases due to supply chain disruptions; however, they are currently proceeding without material delays. For further discussion of our capital requirements, see " Part I, Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity" of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Macroeconomic and Political 
 
 IRA and U.S. Renewable Energy Tax Credits 
 
 The IRA includes provisions that benefit the Company s planned clean energy projects, including increases, extensions, direct transfers and/or new tax credits for wind, solar, and storage. The IRA extends solar ITCs and provides higher credits for projects that satisfy wage and apprenticeship requirements, as well as the technology neutral clean electricity PTC and ITC will provide incremental benefits for our current and future planned renewable projects. For further discussion of our renewable projects, see Note 2, Regulatory Matters - IRP Filings and Replacement Generation to the Financial Statements of IPALCO s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 We account for renewable projects according to GAAP, which, when partnering with tax-equity investors to monetize tax benefits, utilizes the HLBV method. This method recognizes the tax-credit value that is transferred to tax equity investors at the time of its creation, which for projects utilizing the ITC, begins in the quarter the project is placed in service. For projects utilizing the PTC, this value is recognized over 10 years as the facility produces energy. In 2023, we recognized 26.1 million of earnings from tax attributes using the HLBV method upon the first stage of the Hardy Hills Solar Project being placed in service. Upon the final stage of the project being placed in service in May 2024, the Company recognized million of earnings from tax attributes using the HLBV method. As we progress in our plan of integrating additional renewable energy projects under our 2022 IRP, as discussed further below, we anticipate additional earnings associated with the tax attributes of these projects. 
 
 The implementation of the IRA requires substantial guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury and other government agencies. While some of that guidance remains pending, there will be uncertainty with respect to the implementation of certain provisions of the IRA. 
 
 U.S. Income Tax 
 
 The macroeconomic and political environments in the U.S. have changed in recent years. This could result in significant impacts to future tax law. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 In the markets in which we operate, there have been higher rates of inflation recently. If inflation continues to increase in our markets, it may increase our expenses that we may not be able to pass through to customers. It may also increase the costs of some of our construction projects. AES Indiana may have the ability to recover operations and maintenance costs through the regulatory process, however, timing impacts on recovery may vary. In addition, we expect the cost of fuel, specifically coal and natural gas, to continue to be volatile during 2024. Our exposure to fluctuations in the price of fuel is limited because of our FAC. If we are unable to timely or fully recover our fuel and purchased power costs, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 Interest Rates 
 
 In the U.S. there has been a rise in interest rates since 2021, and interest rates are expected to remain volatile in the near term. Although all of our existing IPALCO and AES Indiana long-term debt is at fixed rates, an increase in interest rates can have several impacts on our business. For our existing short-term debt under floating rate structures and any future debt refinancings or future new money financings, rising interest rates will increase future financing costs. Our floating rate debt is currently limited to short-term borrowings under our Credit Agreement and 
 40 

400 million Term Loan Agreement. For future IPALCO debt financings, IPALCO manages a hedging program and evaluates pre-issuance hedges to reduce uncertainty and exposure to future interest rates. 
 
 Regulatory 
 
 Regulatory Rate Review 
 
 On April 17, 2024, the IURC issued an order (the 2024 Base Rate Order approving the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement that AES Indiana entered into on November 22, 2023, with the OUCC and the other intervening parties in AES Indiana s base rate case filing. Please see Note 2, " Regulatory Matters - Regulatory Rate Review" to the Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q for further discussion. 
 
 2022 IRP 
 
 AES Indiana filed its 2022 IRP with the IURC in December 2022. The 2022 IRP short-term action plan includes converting the two remaining coal units at Petersburg to natural gas. Additionally, AES Indiana plans to add up to 1,300 MW of wind, solar, and battery energy storage by 2027. Please see Note 2, " Regulatory Matters" to the Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q and Note 2, Regulatory Matters to the Financial Statements included in IPALCO s 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of these and other regulatory matters. 
 
 Environmental 
 
 We are subject to numerous environmental and climate change laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We face certain risks and uncertainties related to these environmental and climate change laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal or beneficial reuse of CCR) and certain air emissions, such as SO 2 , NO x , particulate matter and mercury and other hazardous air pollutants, and species and habitat protections. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. The following discussion of the impact of environmental laws and regulations on the Company updates the discussion provided in Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters in IPALCO s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 MATS 
 
 In April 2012, the EPA s rule to establish maximum achievable control technology standards for hazardous air pollutants regulated under the CAA emitted from coal and oil-fired electric utilities, known as MATS , became effective. AES Indiana management developed and implemented a plan, which was approved by the IURC, to comply with this rule and all Petersburg units subject to the rule have been and remain in material compliance with the MATS rule since applicable deadlines. 
 
 On April 24, 2023, EPA published the proposed MATS Risk and Technology Review (RTR) Rule. On May 7, 2024, EPA published a final rule to revise MATS for coal and oil-fired EGUs. The final rule is effective on July 8, 2024. The final rule lowers certain emissions limits and revises certain other aspects of MATS. It is too early to determine any potential impact. However, the existing requirements of MATS would not apply to AES Indiana upon conversion of the remaining two coal-fired units at Petersburg to natural gas. The MATS RTR Rule is subject to legal challenges. On October 4, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied emergency stay applications. 
 
 Further rulemakings and/or proceedings are possible; however, in the meantime, MATS remains in effect. We currently cannot predict the outcome of the regulatory or judicial process, or its impact, if any, on our MATS compliance planning or ultimate costs. 
 
 Waste Management and CCR 
 
 The EPA's final CCR rule became effective in October 2015 (the "CCR Rule"). 
 
 The EPA has indicated that they will implement a phased approach to amending the CCR Rule, which is ongoing. On May 18, 2023, EPA published a proposed rule that would expand the scope of CCR units regulated by the CCR Rule. On May 8, 2024, EPA published final revisions to the CCR rule which are effective on November 8, 2024. The final revisions expand the scope of CCR units regulated by the CCR rule to include legacy surface impoundments, 
 41 

inactive surface impoundments, and CCR management units. It is too early to determine any potential impact from this rule. 
 
 On February 20, 2020, the EPA published a proposed rule to establish a federal CCR permit program that would operate in states without approved CCR permit programs. If this rule is finalized before Indiana establishes a final state-level CCR permit program, AES Indiana could eventually be required to apply for a federal CCR permit from the EPA. On December 21, 2022, IDEM published in the Indiana Register a Second Notice of Comment Period for its proposed CCR rulemaking which would include regulation of CCR through a state permitting program. On August 7, 2024, in response to changes to Indiana statute, as well as comments received during the Second Notice of Comment Period, IDEM published a Continuation of the Second Notice of Comment Period for proposed amendments to the draft rule language for a State CCR Permitting Program. 
 
 The CCR Rule, current or future amendments to, or EPA interpretations of, the CCR Rule, Indiana CCR regulations, the results of groundwater monitoring data or the outcome of CCR-related litigation could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We would seek recovery of any resulting expenditures; however, there is no guarantee we would be successful in this regard. See Note 3, " Property, Plant and Equipment - ARO " and Note 10, " Commitments and Contingencies - Contingencies - Legal Matters - Coal Ash Insurance Litigation " to the Financial Statements of IPALCO s 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion. 
 
 Climate Change Legislation and Regulation 
 
 One byproduct of burning coal and other fossil fuels is the emission of GHGs, including CO 2 . We face certain risks related to existing and potential international, federal, state, regional and local GHG legislation and regulations, 
 including risks related to increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs, as well as increased climate change disclosure obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 The final NSPS for CO 2 emissions from new, modified and reconstructed fossil-fuel-fired power plants were published in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015. Several states and industry groups challenged the NSPS for CO 2 in the D.C. Circuit Court. On December 20, 2018, the EPA published proposed revisions to the final NSPS for new, modified and reconstructed coal-fired electric utility steam generating units. The EPA proposed that the Best System of Emissions Reduction (BSER) for these units is highly efficient generation that would be equivalent to supercritical steam conditions for larger units and sub-critical steam conditions for smaller units, and not partial carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), which had been the BSER for these units in the 2015 final NSPS. The EPA did not include revisions for natural-gas combined cycle or simple cycle units in the December 20, 2018 proposal. Challenges to the GHG NSPS remain held in abeyance at this time. On May 23, 2023, EPA published a proposed rule that would establish CO 2 emissions limits for certain new fossil-fuel fired stationary combustion turbines that commence construction or are modified after May 23, 2023. On May 9, 2024, EPA published the final NSPS requiring carbon capture and sequestration for new and reconstructed baseload stationary combustion turbines, among other requirements. EPA did not finalize revisions to the NSPS for newly constructed or reconstructed coal-fired electric utility steam generating units as proposed in 2018. 
 
 On July 8, 2019, the EPA published the final ACE Rule which would have established CO 2 emission rules for existing coal-fired power plants under CAA Section 111(d) and would have replaced the EPA's 2015 CPP, which among other things, had called on states to mandate that power companies shift electricity generation to lower or zero carbon fuel sources. However, on January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded to EPA the ACE Rule. Subsequently, on June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the D.C. Circuit Court and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion, holding that the generation shifting approach in the CPP exceeded the authority granted to EPA by Congress under Section 111(d) of the CAA. As a result of the June 30, 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision, on October 27, 2022, the D.C. Circuit issued a partial mandate holding pending challenges to the ACE Rule in abeyance while EPA developed a replacement rule. 
 
 On May 23, 2023, EPA published a proposed rule that would vacate the ACE Rule, establish emissions guidelines in the form of CO2 emissions limitations for certain existing EGUs and would require states to develop State Plans that establish standards of performance for such EGUs that are at least as stringent as EPA s emissions guidelines. On May 9, 2024, EPA published the final rule regulating GHGs from existing EGUs pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and effective on July 8, 2024. Existing EGUs are those that were constructed prior to January 8, 2014. Depending on various EGU-specific factors, the bases of emissions guidelines for natural gas-fired units include the 
 42 

use of uniform fuels and routine methods of operation and maintenance and the bases of emissions guidelines for coal-fired units include 40 natural gas co-firing or carbon capture and sequestration with 90 capture of CO 2 depending on the date that coal operations cease. Specific standards for performance for EGUs will be established through a State Plan (or a Federal Plan if the state of Indiana were to not submit an approvable plan). The May 2024 rule is subject to legal challenges. On October 16, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied emergency stay applications. 
 
 It is too early to determine any potential impact. GHG regulations, current or future amendments to, resulting state or federal plans, or pending or future litigation associated with such regulations or plans could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We would seek recovery of any resulting capital expenditures; however, there is no guarantee we would be successful in this regard. 
 
 Based on the above, there is some uncertainty with respect to the impact of GHG rules on AES Indiana. The EPA, states and other utilities are still evaluating potential impacts of the GHG regulations in our industry. In light of these uncertainties, we cannot predict the impact of the EPA s current and future GHG regulations, or resulting state or federal plans, on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, but it could be material. 
 
 NAAQS 
 
 Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for six criteria pollutants considered harmful to public health and the 
 environment, including particulate matter, NO x , ozone and SO 2 , which result from fossil-fuel combustion. Areas 
 meeting the NAAQS are designated attainment areas while those that do not meet the NAAQS are considered nonattainment areas. Each state must develop a plan to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the 
 NAAQS, which may include imposing operating limits on individual plants. The EPA is required to review NAAQS at 
 five-year intervals. 
 
 Ozone and NO x . On April 15, 2024, EPA published a proposed rule to retain the secondary NO x NAAQS. 
 
 Fine Particulate Matter . On April 15, 2024, EPA published a proposed rule to retain the current secondary PM NAAQS. 
 
 SO 2 . On April 15, 2024, EPA published a proposed rule to revise the secondary SO 2 NAAQS. 
 
 Based on current and potential national ambient air quality standards, the state of Indiana is required to determine whether certain areas within the state meet the NAAQS. With respect to Marion, Morgan and Pike Counties, as well as any other areas determined to be in "nonattainment," the state of Indiana will be required to modify its SIP to detail how the state will regain its attainment status. As part of this process, it is possible that the IDEM or the EPA may require reductions of emissions from our generating stations to reach attainment status for ozone, fine particulate matter or SO 2 . At this time, we cannot predict what the impact will be to AES Indiana with respect to new ambient standards, but it could be material. 
 
 CSAPR and 2015 Ozone NAAQS FIP 
 
 CSAPR, which became effective in January 2015, addresses the "good neighbor" provision of the CAA, which prohibits sources within each state from emitting any air pollutant in an amount which will contribute significantly to any other state s nonattainment, or interference with maintenance of, any NAAQS. CSAPR is implemented, in part, through a market-based program under which compliance may be achievable through the acquisition and use of emissions allowances created by the EPA. 
 
 On June 5, 2023, the EPA published a final Federal Implementation Plan ("FIP") to address air quality impacts with respect to the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. The rule established a revised CSAPR NO x Ozone Season Group 3 trading program for 22 states, including Indiana and became effective during 2023 and includes enhancements in the revised Group 3 trading program. On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order granting a stay of EPA s 2023 FIP pending resolution of legal challenges to the FIP. 
 
 At this time, we cannot predict the impact of these rule revisions or potential future legal outcomes, but any such impact could include the need to purchase additional allowances or make operational adjustments or could otherwise be material to our business, financial condition or results of operation. 
 
 43 

CWA Facility Response Plan 
 
 On March 28, 2022, the EPA published a proposed rule to establish Facility Response Plan FRP requirements for non-transportation onshore facilities that store CWA hazardous substances and meet certain criteria and thresholds. On March 28, 2024, the EPA published the final CWA Hazardous Substance Facility Response Plans rule which became effective on May 27, 2024. It is too early to determine whether this final rule may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operation. 
 
 CWA - Environmental Wastewater Requirements and Regulation of Water Discharge 
 
 In November 2015, the EPA published its final Steam Electric Power Generating Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELG) rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waterways by steam-electric power plants through technology applications. In 2020, EPA issued a final rule, known as the 2020 Reconsideration Rule, revising certain aspects of the 2015 ELG rule. Wastewater treatment technologies already installed and operated at Petersburg met the requirements of these rules. Following the 2019 U.S. Court of Appeals vacatur and remand of portions of the 2015 ELG rule related to leachate and legacy water, on March 29, 2023, EPA published a proposed rule revising the 2020 Reconsideration Rule. On May 9, 2024, EPA published the final rule which became effective on July 8, 2024. The final rule establishes more stringent best available technology limits for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport water and combustion residual leachate and established a new set of definitions and new limits for combustion residual leachate and legacy wastewater. The May 2024 rule is subject to legal challenges. On October 10, 2024, the Eighth Circuit Court denied stay applications. It is too early to determine whether any outcome of this final rule, litigation or future revisions to the ELG rule might have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 CWA NPDES Permits 
 
 NPDES permits regulate specific industrial wastewater and storm water discharges to the waters of Indiana under Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. A number of CWA regulations described above are implemented through NPDES permits. 
 
 In 2017, IDEM issued to Eagle Valley a NPDES permit regulating water discharges associated with operation of its CCGT. As part of the normal course of business, AES Indiana submitted a timely application for renewal for the Eagle Valley NPDES permit, and on March 31, 2023, IDEM issued the renewed NPDES permit. On April 17, 2023, a third party filed an appeal of Eagle Valley s renewed NPDES permit. AES Indiana contends that the renewed permit was validly issued, and the permit remains in effect. AES Indiana is unable to predict the outcome of the appeal, but depending on the results, it could have an adverse effect on the Company. 
 
 In 2017, IDEM also issued to Harding Street and Petersburg NPDES permits regulating water discharges associated with operation of their power plant operations. As part of the normal course of business, AES Indiana submitted timely applications for renewal for both Harding Street and Petersburg NPDES permits in March 2022. On November 29, 2023, IDEM issued the final NPDES permit renewal for Harding Street with an effective date of January 1, 2024. The permit includes a 316(b) determination requiring the installation of modified traveling screens and fish handling return system and an entrainment study. The permit also includes other new requirements, including new thermal limitations, that could result in the need for AES Indiana to take additional actions to ensure compliance with the final permit. On December 14, 2023, AES Indiana filed a petition for appeal of certain new requirements, including the new thermal limitations, in the final Harding Street NPDES permit. A stay of the appealed requirements was initially granted on January 4, 2024, and is in effect until January 28, 2025 (as extended from October 28, 2024), which could be further extended. The renewal application for the Petersburg NPDES permit remains pending. IDEM published the draft Petersburg NPDES permit for public notice on September 19, 2024, with the comment period closing October 21, 2024. It is too early to determine the potential impact, but final or future permits could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We would seek recovery of any resulting capital expenditures; however, there is no guarantee we would be successful in this regard.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 
 Overview 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 48.3 million and available borrowing capacity of 300 million under our unsecured revolving Credit Agreement. All of AES Indiana s long-term borrowings must first be approved by the IURC and the aggregate amount of AES Indiana s short-term indebtedness must be approved by the FERC. AES Indiana has approval from the FERC to borrow up to 750 million of short-term indebtedness outstanding at any time through July 29, 2026. In February 2024, AES Indiana received an order from the IURC granting authority through December 31, 2026 to, among other things, issue up to 1 billion in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, of which 350 million remains available under the order as of September 30, 2024. This order also grants authority to have up to 750 million of long-term credit agreements and liquidity facilities outstanding at any one time, of which 0 million remains available under the order as of September 30, 2024. As an alternative to the sale of all or a portion of 65 million in principal of the long-term debt, AES Indiana has authority to issue up to 65 million of new preferred stock, all of which authority remains available under the order as of September 30, 2024. The amount of new debt that we issue is additionally restricted as a result of contractual obligations of AES and by the covenants included in our existing debt obligations. Under such restrictions, AES Indiana is generally allowed to fully draw the amounts available on its Credit Agreement, refinance existing debt and issue new debt approved by the IURC and issue certain other indebtedness. We do not believe such restrictions will be a limiting factor in our ability to issue debt in the ordinary course of prudent business operations.

45 

The net change in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by changes in the following (in thousands): 
 Decrease from current and non-current regulatory assets and liabilities primarily due to lower FAC collections in the current year and the settlement of a pre-existing power purchase agreement 
 (220,111) Decrease from accounts receivable driven primarily by the timing of the collections, including billing delays and an increase in revenue mainly due to higher retail volumes 
 (101,459) Increase from income tax receivables 
 47,047 Increase from inventories mainly due to due to lower purchases of fuel inventory in the current year 
 47,109 Increase from accrued interest due to higher interest expense primarily from increased borrowings 
 38,849 Other (11,114) Net change in operating assets and liabilities (199,679) 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 270.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by (in thousands): 
 Higher cash outflows for capital expenditures related with renewable energy projects and growth related capital expenditures primarily from TDSIC investments 
 (273,481) Payments for an acquisition made in the current year (48,368) Purchase of intangibles in 2023 
 44,650 Other 7,194 Net change in investing activities (270,005) 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased 625.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by (in thousands): 
 Increase due to long-term debt issuances at IPALCO and AES Indiana 
 1,050,000 Increase due to short-term borrowings 
 392,000 Increase due to equity capital contributions from shareholders 
 150,000 Increase due to sale to noncontrolling interests 
 46,935 Decrease due to repayment of Senior Secured Notes 
 (405,000) Decrease due to repayment of the term loan issued in 2023 and other short-term borrowings 
 (392,000) Decrease due to higher net revolver draws on AES Indiana's revolving credit facility 
 (180,000) Decrease due to higher distributions to shareholders 
 (43,205) Other 6,858 Net change in financing activities 625,588 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 We expect our existing cash balances, cash generated from operating activities and borrowing capacity on our existing Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet our anticipated operating needs, including interest expense on our debt and dividends to our equity owners. Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and carrying costs, potential margin requirements related to interest rate and commodity hedges, taxes and dividend payments. In 2024 and subsequent years, we expect to satisfy these requirements with a combination of cash from operations, funds from debt financing, funds from tax equity contributions, and parent capital contributions as our internal liquidity needs and market conditions warrant. We also expect that the borrowing capacity under our existing Credit Agreement will continue to be available to manage working capital requirements during those periods. The absence of adequate liquidity could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

 Capital Requirements 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Our capital expenditure program, including development and permitting costs, for the three-year period from 2024 through 2026 (including amounts already expended in the first nine months of 2024) is currently estimated to cost approximately 3.2 billion (excluding environmental compliance), and includes estimates as follows (amounts in millions):

Total TDSIC costs expended from project inception through September 30, 2024 were 825.7 million. 

The amounts described in the capital expenditure program above include estimated spending under AES Indiana s 2022 IRP filed with the IURC in December 2022. See Note 2, " Regulatory Matters - IRP Filings and Replacement Generation - 2022 IRP" to the Financial Statements of IPALCO s 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion. Additionally, estimated capital expenditure spending on environmental compliance costs for the three-year period from 2024 through 2026 is approximately 90 million. Please see Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters" of IPALCO s 2023 Form 10-K for additional details. 
 
 Credit Ratings 
 
 Our ability to borrow money or to refinance existing indebtedness and the interest rates at which we can borrow money or refinance existing indebtedness are affected by our credit ratings. In addition, the applicable interest rates on AES Indiana s Credit Agreement (as well as the amount of certain other fees in the Credit Agreement) are dependent upon the credit ratings of AES Indiana. Downgrades in the credit ratings of AES could result in AES Indiana s and/or IPALCO s credit ratings being downgraded. Any reduction in our debt or credit ratings may adversely affect the trading price of our outstanding debt securities.

We cannot predict whether our current debt and credit ratings or the debt and credit ratings of AES Indiana will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
 
 Dividend Distributions 
 
 All of IPALCO s outstanding common stock is held by AES U.S. Investments and CDPQ. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, IPALCO paid 110.1 million and 66.9 million, respectively, in distributions to its shareholders. Future distributions to our shareholders will be determined at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend primarily on dividends received from AES Indiana. Dividends from AES Indiana are affected by AES Indiana s actual results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements, regulatory and legal considerations, and such other factors as AES Indiana s Board of Directors deems relevant. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements of IPALCO are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. 
 
 Credit Losses 
 
 We use a forward-looking "expected loss" model to recognize allowances for credit losses on customer and other receivables. The allowance for credit losses primarily relates to utility customer receivables, including unbilled amounts. Expected credit loss estimates are developed by disaggregating customers into those with similar credit risk characteristics and using historical credit loss experience. In addition, we also consider how current and future economic conditions are expected to impact the collectability, as applicable, of our receivables balance. Our determination of the allowance for credit losses requires us to make estimates and judgments regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due, which have required a higher degree of estimation given the increases seen in past due customer receivables in 2024. We believe such estimates and judgments are reasonable and the related allowance for credit losses is adequate as of September 30, 2024; however, changes in such estimates and judgments could result in a different conclusion, which could be material. See Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses for further information on AES Indiana s receivable balances. 
 
 The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of IPALCO s 2023 Form 10-K. The Company s other critical accounting estimates are described in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in IPALCO s 2023 Form 10-K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make an assumption about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that would have a material impact on the 
 48 

Company s financial condition or results of operations are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. The Company has reviewed and determined that these remain as critical accounting policies as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 There have been no material changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as previously disclosed in IPALCO s 2023 Form 10-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 The Company carried out the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b), under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 
 Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). As disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company determined that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2023 related to the fourth quarter implementation of SAP IS-U, a software solution that SAP developed for businesses operating in the utility industries. We identified control deficiencies that aggregated to a material weakness in the design and operation of information technology general controls ITGCs which support the Company s internal control processes for revenue recognition and related accounts and disclosures impacted by revenue recognition. The design deficiencies related to user access and program change-management controls. Business process controls (automated and manual) and management review controls reliant on SAP IS-U were deemed ineffective as they were adversely impacted by the ineffective information technology general controls. 
 
 Management has implemented and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated. The remediation actions include: (i) changes to our ITGC attributes in the areas of user access and program change-management for systems supporting the Company s revenue internal control processes to ensure that internal controls are designed and operating effectively; and (ii) training and educating the control owners on ITGC policies concerning the requirements of each control, with a focus on those related to user access and change-management over IT systems impacting our revenue process. Management has performed a lookback analysis to determine if any unauthorized activity occurred related to the control deficiencies; none was identified. 
 
 We believe that these actions will remediate the foregoing material weakness. The material weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except as discussed above, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Management and our Board of Directors are 
 49 

committed to the remediation of this material weakness as well as the continued improvement of the Company s overall system of internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Notwithstanding the existence of the material weaknesses as described above, we believe that the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 In the normal course of business, we are subject to various lawsuits, actions, claims, and other proceedings. We are also, from time to time, involved in other reviews, investigations and proceedings by governmental and regulatory agencies regarding our business, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. We have accrued in our Financial Statements for litigation and claims where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe the amounts provided in our Financial Statements, as prescribed by GAAP, for these matters are adequate in light of the probable and estimable contingencies. However, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims and other matters (including those matters noted below), and to comply with applicable laws and regulations will not exceed the amounts reflected in our Financial Statements. As such, costs, if any, that may be incurred in excess of those amounts provided for in our Financial Statements cannot be reasonably determined, but could be material. 
 
 Please see Note 2, Regulatory Matters and Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies to the Financial Statements included in Part I - Financial Information of this Form 10-Q for a summary of certain legal proceedings involving us. In addition, our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and the Notes to IPALCO s Consolidated Financial Statements included therein contain descriptions of certain legal proceedings in which we are or were involved. The information in or incorporated by reference into this Item 1 to Part II is limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings and new legal proceedings, since the filing of such Form 10-K, and should be read in conjunction with such Forms 10-K and our Form 10-Qs. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
