for all transportation costs, risk of loss, and any other costs that point onward.

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures .
The amended guidance enhances income tax disclosures primarily related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid
information. This guidance requires disclosure of specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation and further information
on reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amended guidance requires disaggregating income taxes paid (net
of refunds received) by federal, state, and foreign taxes. It also requires disaggregating individual jurisdictions in which income taxes
paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The amended
guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively.
The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact this amended guidance may have on the footnotes to our unaudited condensed
 consolidated financial statements. 

Except for
the above-mentioned pronouncements, there are no new recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on the unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and cash flows.

For the six months ended October 31, 2024 and
2023, allowance of expected credit losses was recorded by the Company. 

The Company generally conducts its business with
creditworthy third parties. The Company determines, on a continuing basis, the probable losses and an allowance for expected credit losses,
based on several factors including internal risk ratings, customer credit quality, payment history, historical bad debt/write-off experience
and forecasted economic and market conditions. Accounts receivable are written off after exhaustive collection efforts occur and the receivable
is deemed uncollectible. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and its exposure to bad debts is not significant. 

For the six months ended October 31, 2024 and
2023, allowance for obsolete inventories was recorded by the Company.

allowance as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024 was . In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization
of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences
become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and
tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty
exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance
as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024. Up to six years since inception remain open for examination only by taxing authorities of US
Federal and State of Nevada.

Limited
operating history ; need for additional capital 

There is
no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage of operations
and have generated limited revenues since inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business
is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost
overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.

capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 

We had no contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of
October 31, 2024. 

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

None. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of October 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 

The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1)
lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors
on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
and (2) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were
identified by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of
October 31, 2024. 

23 

Management believes that the material weaknesses
set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a
functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board of Directors results in ineffective oversight
in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our
financial statements in future periods. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are aware that any system of controls, however
well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met, and that
maintenance of disclosure controls and procedures is an ongoing process that may change over time.
