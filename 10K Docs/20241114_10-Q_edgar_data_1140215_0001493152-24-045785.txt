 NOTES
TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 Three
and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (Unaudited) 

 (In
thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

,
and utilized 
 of cash in operations and at September 30, 2024,
had a working capital deficiency of 
 and a stockholders deficit of .
As of September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed 
 on its line of credit and owed on its Notes (See Note 5 and Note 6 for further
detail). These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the
date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, has also expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of , no availability under our line of credit and of additional borrowing capacity
from the credit facility assuming there is availability under the terms. 

Historically,
we have financed our operations through public and private sales of common stock, issuance of preferred and common stock, convertible
debt instruments, term loans and credit lines from financial institutions, and cash generated from operations. To alleviate these conditions,
management is currently evaluating various funding alternatives and may seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity,
mezzanine or debt securities, through arrangements with strategic partners or through obtaining credit from financial institutions. The
Company is continuing to discuss restructuring of debt with existing lenders and is exploring new financing opportunities to address
the line of credit which comes due in March 2025 (see Note 5) and the portion of the debt under the Notes which comes due on December
15, 2024 (see Note 6). As we seek additional sources of financing, there can be no assurance that such financing would be available to
us on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the debt and equity capital markets is subject to several
factors, including market and economic conditions, our performance and investor sentiment with respect to us and our industry. 

We
have also taken decisive action to improve our margins, including fully outsourcing our manufacturing process, streamlining our product
portfolio, negotiating improved vendor contracts and restructuring our selling prices. 

as compared to in the
three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average cost of shipping and handling was
 per case, as compared to per case for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Although the Company has experienced decreases
in freight costs over the last four quarters, in the Company s opinion there remains a volatile environment and the Company will
continue to monitor pricing and availability in transportation. Mitigation plans have been implemented to manage this risk. The Company
has been negatively impacted by supply chain challenges affecting our ability to benefit from strong demand for, and increased sales
of our product. The disruption caused by labor shortages, significant raw material cost inflation, logistics issues and increased freight
costs, and ongoing port congestion, resulted in suppressed margins. The Company has experienced moderation in inflation and anticipates
this continuing throughout 2024.

31, 2023, the Company utilized nine separate co-packers for most its production and bottling of beverage products in the United States.
The Company has long-standing relationships with two different co-packers, and a third co-packing agreement with California Custom Beverage
LLC CCB ), a former related party (see Note 11). Although there are other packers, a change in co-packers may cause a delay
in the production process, which could ultimately affect operating results.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Our
discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as
an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed financial statements and the accompanying notes. Cautionary statements
on page [ii] of this report and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K as updated by Part II, Item
1A of this report, should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. 

In
addition to our GAAP results, the following discussion includes Modified EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. We present
Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent
basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified EBITDA
in developing our internal budgets, forecasts, and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in evaluating
potential acquisitions; making compensation decisions; and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance.
Modified EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from
operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities
as a measure of liquidity. We define Modified EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based
compensation, changes in fair value of warrant expense, and one-time restructuring-related costs including employee severance and asset
impairment. 

The
following discussion also includes the use of gross billing, a key performance indicator and metric. Gross billing represents invoiced
amounts to distributors and retailers, excluding sales adjustments. Gross billing may include deductions from MSRP or list price ,
where applicable, and excludes promotional costs of generating such sales. Management utilizes gross billing to monitor operating performance
of products and salespersons, which performance can be masked by the effect of promotional or other allowances. Management believes that
the presentation of gross billing provides a useful measure of Reed s operating performance. 

Amounts
presented in the discussion below are in thousands, except share and per share amounts. 

Results
of Operations 

Overview 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued to focus on strengthening its supply chain, implement gross margin enhancement initiatives,
drive efficiencies in transportation and warehouse costs and reduce operating expenses. In addition, it continues to build its innovation
pipeline with sustained growth in Reed s Real Ginger Ale, Virgil s Zero Sugar handcrafted sodas, Reed s Classic and
Stormy Mule, and Reed s Hard Ginger Ale. 

The
Company remains engaged on driving sales growth, improving gross margin, and reducing freight costs. The sales growth focus is on channel
expansion, increase in store placements, new product introduction and improved sales execution. The margin enhancement initiative is
driven by packaging savings, co-packer upgrades, and better leveraged purchasing and improved efficiency. Underpinning these initiatives
is a focus on strategically reducing operating costs particularly delivery and handling expenses. In addition, the Company continues
to augment its co-packer network to drive further efficiencies and build proper levels of inventory at the appropriate location to maximize
delivery metrics. 

Recent
Trends Market Conditions 

Although
the U.S. economy continued to grow throughout 2023 and into Q3 2024, the higher inflation, the actions by the Federal Reserve to address
inflation, and rising energy prices create uncertainty about the future economic environment which will continue to evolve and may impact
our business in future periods. We have experienced supply chain challenges, including increased lead times, as well as inflation of
raw materials, logistics and labor costs due to availability constraints and high demand. Although we regularly monitor companies in
our supply chain, and use alternative suppliers when necessary and available, supply chain constraints could cause a disruption in our
ability to obtain raw materials required to manufacture our products and adversely affect our operations. 

1 

During
the three months ending September 30, 2024, the Company continued to experience moderation from the elevated freight costs experienced
in 2023. The average cost of shipping and handling for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 2.99 as compared to 2.98 in the
three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average cost of shipping and handling was
 2.66 per case, as compared to 3.17 per case for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Although the Company has experienced decreases
in freight costs over the last four quarters, in the Company s opinion there remains a volatile environment and the Company will
continue to monitor pricing and availability in transportation. Mitigation plans have been implemented to manage this risk. The Company
has been negatively impacted by supply chain challenges affecting our ability to benefit from strong demand for, and increased sales
of our product. The disruption caused by labor shortages, significant raw material cost inflation, logistics issues and increased freight
costs, and ongoing port congestion, resulted in suppressed margins. The Company has experienced moderation in inflation and anticipates
this to continue throughout 2024.

(A)
We define gross billing as the total sales for the Company unadjusted for costs related to generating those sales. Management utilizes
gross billing as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance of products and salespersons before the effect of any promotional
or other allowances, which are determined in accordance with GAAP, and can mask certain performance issues. We believe that the presentation
of gross billing provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Additionally, gross billing may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures used by other companies, as gross billing has been defined by our internal reporting practices . 

(B)
We define promotional and other allowances as costs deducted from gross billing which are associated with generating those sales. Management
utilizes promotional and other allowances as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance of products, salespersons, and customer
agreements. We believe that the presentation of promotional and other allowances provides a useful measure of our operating performance.
The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and
the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. The expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance
with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition
of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances
primarily include consideration given to the Company s distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following:
(i) reimbursements given to the Company s distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including
slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (ii) the Company s agreed share of fees given
to distributors and/or directly to retailers for in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iii) the Company s agreed share
of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (iv) incentives given to the Company s distributors
and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; and (v) discounted or free products. Promotional and other
allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company s promotional allowance programs with its numerous
distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally
provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year.

Sales,
Cost of Sales, and Gross Margins 

As
part of the Company s ongoing initiative to simplify and streamline operations, the Company has identified core products on which
to place its strategic focus. These core products consist of Reed s and Virgil s branded beverages. Non-core products consist
primarily of Wellness Shots, candy and slower selling discontinued Reed s and Virgil s SKUs. 

Core
beverage volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024, represents 100 of all beverage volume. 

Core
brand gross billing decreased by 33 to 8,901 compared to 13,197 during the same period last year, driven by a Reed s volume
decrease of 37 and Virgil s volume decrease of 26 . The result is a decrease in total gross billing of 33 , to 8,901 during the
three months ended September 30, 2023, from 13,219 in the same period last year. Prices on our core brands increased 1 to 20.79 per
case. The lower gross billings was a result of volume declines that have impacted the carbonated soft drink segment as a result of price increases
coupled with the Company s inability to produce sufficient levels of inventory to meet current demand as a result of tighter credit
terms from suppliers. 

Discounts
as a percentage of gross sales was 24 compared to 10 in the same period last year. As a result, net sales revenue decreased 43 in
the three months ended September 30, 2024, to 6,752, compared to 11,856 in the same period last year driven by lower sales and elevated
trade spend. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold decreased 2,286 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year. As a percentage
of net sales, cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 82 as compared to 66 for the same period last year.
The decline as a percentage of net sales, was driven by elevated trade spend, partially offset by lower supply chain and input costs. 

The
total cost of goods per case increased to 12.91 per case in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 12.22 per case for the
same period last year. 

Gross
Margin 

Gross
margin was 18 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 34 for the same period last year. 

Operating
Expenses 

Delivery
and Handling Expenses 

Delivery
and handling expenses consist of delivery costs to customers and warehousing costs incurred for handling our finished goods after production.
Delivery and handling expenses decreased by 629 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, to 1,279 from 1,908 in the same period
last year, driven by our efforts to mitigate inflationary costs. Delivery costs in the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 19 
of net sales and 2.99 per case, compared to 16 of net sales and 2.98 per case during the same period last year. 

Selling
and Marketing Expenses 

Marketing
expenses consist of direct marketing, marketing labor, and marketing support costs. Selling expenses consist of all other
selling-related expenses including personnel and contractor support. Total selling and marketing expenses were 1,283 during the
three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 861 during the same period last year, an increase of 422. As a percentage of
net sales, selling and marketing costs was 19 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7 during the same
period last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher employee related costs, marketing spend, and higher service fees
related to e-commerce sales. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of the cost of executive, administrative, and finance personnel, as well as professional
fees. General and administrative expenses increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 1,791 from 1,407, an increase
of 384 over the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses were 27 during the three months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 12 during the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher professional fees, bad
debt expense, investor related costs and employee related costs. 

4 

Loss
from Operations 

The
loss from operations was 3,138 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a loss of 143 in the same period last
year driven by decreased gross profit and an increase in operating expenses discussed above. 

Interest
and Other Expense 

Interest
and other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, consisted of 1,012 of interest expense. During the same period last
year, interest and other expense consisted of 1,293 of interest expense. 

Modified
EBITDA 

In
addition to our GAAP results, we present Modified EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. However, Modified EBITDA is not
a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other
performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.
We define Modified EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation,
changes in fair value of warrant expense, change in fair value of SAFE agreements, legal and insurance settlements, non-recurring professional
fees inventory write-offs associated with exited categories and major packaging and formula changes, one-time changes in policy, impact
of changes to accounting methodology and one-time restructuring-related costs including employee severance and asset impairment. 

Management
considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management of
the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations during that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results
prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them
appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Modified EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that
are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Modified EBITDA should not be construed
as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 

Set
forth below is a reconciliation of net loss to Modified EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (unaudited; in

We
present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on
a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified
EBITDA in developing our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in
evaluating potential acquisitions; making compensation decisions; and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial
performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following: 

Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on
 our debts; and 

Although
 depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in
 the future, and Modified EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

(A) 
 We
 define gross billing as the total sales for the Company unadjusted for costs related to generating those sales. Management utilizes
 gross billing as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance of products and salespersons before the effect of any promotional
 or other allowances, which are determined in accordance with GAAP, and can mask certain performance issues. We believe that the presentation
 of gross billing provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Additionally, gross billing may not be comparable to similarly
 titled measures used by other companies, as gross billing have been defined by our internal reporting practices . 

(B) 
 We
 define promotional and other allowances as costs deducted from gross billing which are associated with generating those sales. Management
 utilizes promotional and other allowances as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance of products, salespersons, and
 customer agreements. We believe that the presentation of promotional and other allowances provides a useful measure of our operating
 performance. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination
 of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. The expenditures described in this line item are determined
 in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally,
 our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional
 and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the Company s distributors or retail customers including, but
 not limited to the following: (i) reimbursements given to the Company s distributors for agreed portions of their promotional
 spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (ii) the Company s
 agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iii)
 the Company s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (iv) incentives
 given to the Company s distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; and (v)
 discounted or free products. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company s
 promotional allowance programs with its numerous distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary
 course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations,
 ranging from one week to one year. 

Sales,
Cost of Sales, and Gross Margins 

As
part of the Company s ongoing initiative to simplify and streamline operations the Company has identified core products on which
to place its strategic focus. These core products consist of Reed s and Virgil s branded beverages. Non-core products consist
primarily of Wellness Shots, candy and slower selling discontinued Reed s and Virgil s SKUs. 

Core
beverage volume for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents 100 of all beverage volume. 

Core
brand gross billing decreased by 10 to 32,864 compared to 36,626 during the same period last year, driven by Reed s volume
decline of 10 and Virgil s volume decline of 16 . The result is a decrease in total gross billing of 11 , to 32,864 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 36,837 in the same period last year. Price on our core brands increased 1 to 20.81
per case. The lower gross billings was a result of volume declines that have impacted the carbonated soft drink segment as a result of price increases
coupled with the Company s inability to produce sufficient levels of inventory to meet current demand as a result of tighter
credit terms from suppliers. 

Discounts
as a percentage of gross sales was 14 compared to 10 in the same period last year. As a result, net sales revenue decreased 15 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 28,221, compared to 33,018 in the same period last year driven by lower sales and elevated
trade spend. 

7 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold decreased 4,016 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year. As a percentage
of net sales, cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 70 as compared to 72 for the same period last year.
 The decrease was driven by lower supply chain and input costs. 

The
total cost of goods per case decreased to 12.52 per case in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 13.17 per case for the same
period last year. The cost of goods sold per case on core brands was 12.51 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 13.11 for the same period last year. 

Gross
Margin 

Gross
margin increased to 30 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 28 for the same period last year. 

Operating
Expenses 

Delivery
and Handling Expenses 

Delivery
and handling expenses consist of delivery costs to customers and warehousing costs incurred for handling our finished goods after production.
Delivery and handling expenses decreased by 1,510 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 4,204 from 5,714 in the same period
last year, driven by our efforts to mitigate inflationary costs. Delivery costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 15 
of net sales and 2.66 per case, compared to 17 of net sales and 3.17 per case during the same period last year. 

Selling
and Marketing Expenses 

Marketing
expenses consist of direct marketing, marketing labor, and marketing support costs. Selling expenses consist of all other
selling-related expenses including personnel and contractor support. Total selling and marketing expenses were 3,473 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,567 during the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, selling and
marketing expenses were 12 of net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 11 of net sales during the
same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower co-op advertising fees, employee related costs and marketing spend partially
offset by higher broker fees and e-commerce delivery costs. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of the cost of executive, administrative, and finance personnel, as well as professional
fees. General and administrative expenses increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 5,239 from 4,427, an increase of
 812 over the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher employee related costs, legal settlement related costs, professional
fees, and quality assurance costs spending partially offset by lower public company costs. 

Loss
from Operations 

The
loss from operations was 4,457 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a loss of 4,468 in the same period last
year driven by increased gross profit and decreased operating expenses discussed above. 

Interest
and Other Expense 

Interest
and other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted of 4,578 of interest expense. During the same period last
year, interest and other expense consisted of 4,459 of interest expense.

Modified
EBITDA 

In
addition to our GAAP results, we present Modified EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. However, Modified EBITDA is not
a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other
performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.
We define Modified EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation,
changes in fair value of warrant expense, change in fair value of SAFE agreements, legal and insurance settlements, non-recurring professional
fees inventory write-offs associated with exited categories and major packaging and formula changes, one-time changes in policy, impact
of changes to accounting methodology and one-time restructuring-related costs including employee severance and asset impairment. 

Management
considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management of
the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations during that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results
prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them
appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Modified EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that
are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Modified EBITDA should not be construed
as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 

Set
forth below is a reconciliation of net loss to Modified EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (unaudited; in thousands):

Modified EBITDA

We
present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on
a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified
EBITDA in developing our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in
evaluating potential acquisitions; making compensation decisions; and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial
performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following: 

Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

9 

Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on
 our debts; and 

Although
 depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in
 the future, and Modified EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net loss of 9,035, and utilized 2,254 of cash in operations and at September
30, 2024, had a working capital deficiency of 22,923 and a stockholders deficit of 21,953. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
borrowed 5,390 on its line of credit and owed 21,751 on its Notes (See Note 5 and Note 6 for further detail). These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are
issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 306, no availability under our line of credit and 7,529 of additional borrowing capacity
from the credit facility assuming there is availability under the terms. 

On
July 26, 2024, Norman E. Snyder Jr, CEO of the Company, provided a personal guaranty for a 500 over advance on our existing line of
credit with ACS. On August 1, 2024, the Company funded 1,400 pursuant to an option exercise by Whitebox under the Option Notes. 

Historically,
we have financed our operations through public and private sales of common stock, issuance of preferred and common stock, convertible
debt instruments, term loans and credit lines from financial institutions, and cash generated from operations. To alleviate these conditions,
management is currently evaluating various funding alternatives and may seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity,
mezzanine or debt securities, through arrangements with strategic partners or through obtaining credit from financial institutions. The
Company is continuing to discuss the restructuring of debt with existing lenders and is exploring new financing opportunities to address
the line of credit which comes due in March 2025 (see Note 5) and the portion of debt under the Notes that is due on December 15, 2024
(see Note 6). As we seek additional sources of financing, there can be no assurance that such financing would be available to us on favorable
terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the debt and equity capital markets is subject to several factors, including
market and economic conditions, our performance and investor sentiment with respect to us and our industry. 

We
have also taken decisive action to improve our margins, including fully outsourcing our manufacturing process, streamlining our product
portfolio, negotiating improved vendor contracts and restructuring our selling prices.

Payable and Existing Financing 

Please
refer to Notes 5 and 6 in the accompanying condensed financial statements for a description of our existing line of credit agreement
and outstanding notes payable. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of the Company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Some of those judgments can
be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in
relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management regularly evaluates
the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances,
historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to assumptions used in estimates for reserves
of uncollectible accounts, inventory obsolescence, depreciable lives of property and equipment, analysis of impairments of recorded long-term
tangible and intangible assets, realization of deferred tax assets, accruals for potential liabilities and assumptions made in valuing
stock instruments issued for services. There were no changes to our critical accounting policies described in the condensed financial
statements included in our 2023 10-K that impacted our condensed financial statements and related notes included herein.
