 equity interest in Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. Carrols ), which was accounted for as an equity method investment. On May 16, 2024, we acquired the remaining of Carrols issued and outstanding shares that were not already held by us or our affiliates for per share in an all cash transaction (the Carrols Acquisition in order to accelerate the reimaging of more than Carrols restaurants before refranchising the majority of the acquired portfolio to new or existing smaller franchise operations. The Carrols Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination by applying the acquisition method of accounting and Carrols became our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary. 
 The acquisition of the equity interest of Carrols was accounted for as a step acquisition, which required remeasurement of our existing ownership interest in Carrols to fair value. We utilized the per share acquisition price to determine the fair value of the existing equity interest. This resulted in an increase in the value of our existing equity interest and the recognition of a gain of million (the Step Acquisition Gain ), which is included in (Income) loss from equity method investments in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Total cash paid in connection with the Carrols Acquisition was million. Additionally, in connection with the Carrols Acquisition, we assumed approximately million of outstanding debt, all of which was fully extinguished as of June 30, 2024. The cash purchase price and extinguishment of debt assumed in the Carrols Acquisition was funded with a combination of cash on hand and million of incremental borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility.

 Total consideration 
 (a) Effective settlement of pre-existing balances with Carrols related to franchise and lease agreements prior to the date of acquisition. 
 Fees and expenses related to the Carrols Acquisition and related financings totaled approximately million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of professional fees and compensation related expenses which are classified as general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations (the Carrols Acquisition Costs ).

 The purchase price allocation reflects preliminary fair value estimates based on management's analysis, including preliminary work performed by third-party valuation specialists. During the measurement period, we will continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair value of net assets acquired. 
 Reacquired franchise rights, which represent the fair value of reacquired franchise agreements determined using the excess earnings method, are amortized over the remaining term of the reacquired franchise agreement and have an estimated weighted average remaining term of years. 
 Goodwill is considered to represent the value associated with the workforce and synergies anticipated to be realized as a combined company. Goodwill will be allocated to reporting units when the purchase price allocation is finalized during the measurement period. 
 Total revenues of Carrols from the acquisition date of May 16, 2024 through September 30, 2024, which have been included within Company restaurant sales in our condensed consolidated financial statements, totaled million.

The unaudited supplemental pro forma consolidated revenue gives effect to actual revenues prior to the Carrols Acquisition, adjusted to exclude the elimination of intercompany transactions. Other than the impact of the Step Acquisition Gain and Carrols Acquisition Costs (as discussed above), supplemental pro forma net earnings, assuming the Carrols Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2023, would not be materially different from the results reported during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate during these periods was primarily the result of the mix of income from multiple tax jurisdictions, the impact of internal financing arrangements, the impact of the Carrols Acquisition, and equity-based compensation. 
 Our effective tax rate was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate during these periods reflects the mix of income from multiple tax jurisdictions, the impact of internal financing arrangements, and a favorable structural change that benefited 2023. 
 On June 20, 2024, Canada enacted significant tax legislation including the introduction of the excessive interest and financing expenses limitation EIFEL as well as a 2 tax on certain share buy backs. The EIFEL rules are applicable for the current fiscal year, while the tax on share buy backs applies to certain share repurchases on or after January 1, 2024. As a result, we expect to have restricted interest and financing tax deductions which will increase our cash taxes but can be carried forward indefinitely.

 Partnership exchangeable units pursuant to exchange notices received. In accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement, Partnership satisfied the exchange notices by exchanging these Partnership exchangeable units for the same number of newly issued RBI common shares. In connection with an amendment to the partnership agreement, Partnership exchangeable units exchanged for RBI common shares subsequent to December 31, 2023 also result in the issuance of additional Class A common units to RBI in an amount equal to the number of RBI common shares exchanged. The issuances of shares were accounted for as capital contributions by RBI to Partnership. The exchanges of Partnership exchangeable units were recorded as increases to the Class A common units balance within partners capital in our consolidated balance sheet in an amount equal to the market value of the newly issued RBI common shares and a reduction to the Partnership exchangeable units balance within partners capital of our consolidated balance sheet in an amount equal to the cash paid by Partnership, if any, and the market value of the newly issued RBI common shares.

 million to hedge the variability in the interest payments on a portion of our Term Loan Facilities, including any subsequent refinancing or replacement of the Term Loan Facilities, beginning August 31, 2021 through the termination date of October 31, 2028. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we also had outstanding receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million to hedge the variability in the interest payments on a portion of our Term Loan Facilities effective September 30, 2019 through the termination date of September 30, 2026. Following the discontinuance of the U.S. dollar LIBOR after June 30, 2023, the interest rate on all these interest rate swaps transitioned from LIBOR to SOFR, with no impact to hedge effectiveness and no change in accounting treatment as a result of applicable accounting relief guidance for the transition away from LIBOR. At inception, all of these interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting. The unrealized changes in market value are recorded in AOCI, net of tax, and reclassified into interest expense during the period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 
 In connection with the Carrols Acquisition, we assumed a receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swap utilizing SOFR as the benchmark interest rate with a total notional value of million to hedge the variability in the interest payments on a portion of our Term Loan Facilities, including any subsequent refinancing or replacement of the Term Loan Facilities, through the termination date of February 28, 2025. This interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge for hedge accounting and the unrealized changes in market value are recorded in AOCI, net of tax, and reclassified into interest expense during the period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 
 At September 30, 2024, the net amount of pre-tax gains that we expect to be reclassified from AOCI into interest expense within the next 12 months is million. 
 Cross-Currency Rate Swaps 
 To protect the value of our investments in our foreign operations against adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we hedge a portion of our net investment in one or more of our foreign subsidiaries by using cross-currency rate swaps. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding cross-currency rate swap contracts between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar and the euro and U.S. dollar that have been designated as net investment hedges of a portion of our equity in foreign operations in those currencies. The component of the gains and losses on our net investment in these designated foreign operations driven by changes in foreign exchange rates are economically partly offset by movements in the fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts. The fair value of the swaps is calculated each period with changes in fair value reported in AOCI, net of tax. Such amounts will remain in AOCI until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding cross-currency rate swaps that we entered into during 2022 to partially hedge the net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries. At inception, these cross-currency rate swaps were designated and continue to be hedges and are accounted for as net investment hedges. These swaps are contracts in which we receive quarterly fixed-rate interest payments on the U.S. dollar notional amount of million through the maturity date of September 30, 2028. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding cross-currency rate swap contracts between the euro and U.S. dollar in which we receive quarterly fixed-rate interest payments on the U.S. dollar aggregate amount of million, of which million have a maturity date of October 31, 2026, million have a maturity date of November 30, 2028, and million have a maturity date of October 31, 2028. At inception, these cross-currency rate swaps were designated and continue to be hedges and are accounted for as net investment hedges. 
 During 2023, we settled our previously existing cross-currency rate swaps in which we paid quarterly fixed-rate interest payments on the euro notional value of million and receive quarterly fixed-rate interest payments on the U.S. dollar notional value of million and an original maturity date of February 17, 2024. During 2023, we also settled our previously existing cross-currency rate swap contracts between the euro and U.S. dollar with a notional value of million and an original maturity date of February 17, 2024.

 million with maturities to November 17, 2025. We have designated these instruments as cash flow hedges, and as such, the unrealized changes in market value of effective hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings during the period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 
 Credit Risk 
 By entering into derivative contracts, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk. Counterparty credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is in an asset position, the counterparty has a liability to us, which creates credit risk for us. We attempt to minimize this risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and regularly monitoring our market position with each counterparty. 
 Credit-Risk Related Contingent Features

 Following the Carrols Acquisition and PLK China Acquisition, we established a new operating and reportable segment, Restaurant Holdings, which includes results from the Carrols Burger King restaurants and the PLK China restaurants and reflects how our chief operating decision maker manages and assesses performance of our segments. This management approach is consistent with our long-term plans to refranchise the vast majority of the Carrols Burger King restaurants and to find a new partner for PLK China restaurants. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we are reporting results under six operating and reportable segments consisting of the following:

 Intersegment Transactions 
 BK and INTL results include revenues and RH results include expenses from an intersegment franchisor-franchisee relationship. From the date of acquisition, BK results include royalty, property, advertising contribution and tech fees revenues recognized for intersegment transactions with Burger King restaurants acquired from Carrols, with corresponding expenses recognized by RH. From the date of acquisition, INTL results include royalty and advertising contribution revenues recognized for intersegment transactions with PLK China restaurants, with corresponding expenses recognized by RH. These intersegment revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidation but are presented within segment results in a manner consistent with internal reporting used to assess performance and allocate resources. 
 RH Results 
 The changes in our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are partially driven by the inclusion of the results of operations of RH.

 Key Operating Metrics 
 Key performance indicators are shown for RBI's five franchisor operating segments TH, BK, PLK, FHS and INTL. RH results for the Carrols BK restaurants and PLK China restaurants are included in the BK segment and INTL segment, respectively. 
 We evaluate our restaurants and assess our business based on the following operating metrics: 
 System-wide sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants and Company restaurants (referred to as system-wide sales) in one period from the same period in the prior year. 
 Comparable sales refers to the percentage change in restaurant sales in one period from the same prior year period for restaurants that have been open for 13 months or longer for Tim Hortons, Burger King and Firehouse Subs and 17 months or longer for Popeyes. Additionally, if a restaurant is closed for a significant portion of a month, the restaurant is excluded from the monthly comparable sales calculation. 
 System-wide sales growth and comparable sales are measured on a constant currency basis, which means the results exclude the effect of foreign currency translation FX Impact ). For system-wide sales growth and comparable sales, we calculate the FX Impact by translating prior year results at current year monthly average exchange rates. 
 Unless otherwise stated, system-wide sales growth, system-wide sales and comparable sales are presented on a system-wide basis, which means they include franchised restaurants and Company restaurants. System-wide results are driven by our franchised restaurants, as approximately 95 of system-wide restaurants are franchised. Franchise sales represent sales at all franchised restaurants and are revenues to our franchisees. We do not record franchise sales as revenues; however, our royalty revenues and advertising fund contributions are calculated based on a percentage of franchise sales. 
 Net restaurant growth refers to the net change in restaurant count (openings, net of permanent closures) over a trailing twelve month period, divided by the restaurant count at the beginning of the trailing twelve month period. In determining whether a restaurant meets our definition of a restaurant that will be included in our net restaurant growth, we consider factors such as scope of operations, format and image, separate franchise agreement, and minimum sales thresholds. We refer to restaurants that do not meet our definition as alternative formats. These alternative formats are helpful to build brand awareness, test new concepts and provide convenience in certain markets. 
 These metrics are important indicators of the overall direction of our business, including trends in sales and the effectiveness of each brand s marketing, operations and growth initiatives.

 Non-GAAP Reconciliations 
 The table below contains information regarding Adjusted Operating Income, which is a non-GAAP measure. This non-GAAP measure does not have a standardized meaning under U.S. GAAP and may differ from a similar captioned measure of other companies in our industry. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in assessing our operating performance, as it provides them with the same tools that management uses to evaluate our performance and is responsive to questions we receive from both investors and analysts. By disclosing this non-GAAP measure, we intend to provide investors with a consistent comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. Adjusted Operating Income is defined as income from operations excluding (i) franchise agreement and reacquired franchise rights intangible asset amortization as a result of acquisition accounting, (ii) (income) loss from equity method investments, net of cash distributions received from equity method investments, (iii) other operating expenses (income), net and, (iv) income/expenses from non-recurring projects and non-operating activities. For the periods referenced, income/expenses from non-recurring projects and 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 non-operating activities included (i) non-recurring fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Carrols Acquisition and the PLK China Acquisition consisting primarily of professional fees, compensation related expenses and integration costs; (ii) non-recurring fees and expense incurred in connection with the acquisition of Firehouse consisting of professional fees, compensation related expenses and integration costs; and (iii) non-operating costs from professional advisory and consulting services associated with certain transformational corporate restructuring initiatives that rationalize our structure and optimize cash movements as well as services related to significant tax reform legislation and regulations. Management believes that these types of expenses are either not related to our underlying profitability drivers or not likely to re-occur in the foreseeable future and the varied timing, size and nature of these projects may cause volatility in our results unrelated to the performance of our core business that does not reflect trends of our core operations. 
 Adjusted Operating Income is used by management to measure operating performance of the business, excluding these non-cash and other specifically identified items that management believes are not relevant to management s assessment of our operating performance. Adjusted Operating Income, as defined above, also represents our measure of segment income for each of our operating segments.

 The increase in Adjusted Operating Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects an increase in segment income in all of our segments and the inclusion of RH segment income, partially offset by an unfavorable FX Impact of 10 million and 26 million, respectively. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated by operations, and borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). We have used, and may in the future use, our liquidity to make required interest and/or principal payments, to make distributions to RBI for RBI to repurchase its common shares, to repurchase Class B exchangeable limited partnership units of Partnership Partnership exchangeable units ), to voluntarily prepay and repurchase our or one of our affiliates outstanding debt, to fund acquisitions and other investing activities, such as capital expenditures and 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 joint ventures, and to make distributions on Class A common units and distributions on the Partnership exchangeable units. Our liquidity requirements are significant, primarily due to debt service requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1,176 million and borrowing availability of 1,247 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ). Based on our current level of operations and available cash, we believe our cash flow from operations, combined with our availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, debt service requirements and capital spending over the next twelve months. 
 On May 16, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Carrols for a total cash purchase price of 543 million. In connection with the Carrols Acquisition, we assumed approximately 431 million of outstanding debt, all of which was fully extinguished as of June 30, 2024. The cash purchase price and extinguishment of debt assumed in the Carrols Acquisition was funded with a combination of cash on hand and 750 million of incremental borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility. 
 In September 2022, Burger King shared the details of its Reclaim the Flame plan to accelerate sales growth and drive franchisee profitability. We are investing 400 million over the life of the plan, comprised of 150 million in advertising and digital investments Fuel the Flame and 250 million in high-quality remodels and relocations, restaurant technology, kitchen equipment, and building enhancements Royal Reset ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we funded 20 million toward the Fuel the Flame investment and 45 million toward our Royal Reset investment and as of September 30, 2024, we have funded a total of 93 million toward the Fuel the Flame investment and 107 million toward our Royal Reset investment since program inception. 
 In April 2024, Burger King announced plans to extend its Long-Term Royal Reset program with plans to invest an additional 300 million in remodels from 2025 through 2028. Additionally, as previously announced, we will invest an additional 500 million to remodel more than 600 Burger King restaurants acquired as part of the Carrols Acquisition. 
 On May 16, 2024, two of our subsidiaries (the Borrowers entered into a sixth incremental facility amendment and a ninth amendment (the First 2024 Amendment to the credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan A facility (the Term Loan A ), our senior secured term loan B facility (the Term Loan B and together with the Term Loan A the Term Loan Facilities and our 1,250 million senior secured revolving credit facility (including revolving loans, swingline loans and letters of credit) (the Revolving Credit Facility and together with the Term Loan Facilities, the Credit Facilities ). The First 2024 Amendment increased the existing Term Loan B by 750 million to 5,912 million on the same terms as the existing Term Loan B. The First 2024 Amendment also amended the interest rate applicable to the Canadian dollar loans under the Credit Agreement to be based on Term Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average CORRA ). The security and guarantees under the amended Credit Agreement are the same as those under the existing facilities. The First 2024 Amendment made no other material changes to the terms of the Credit Agreement. The proceeds from the increase in the Term Loan B were used, along with cash on hand, to complete the Carrols Acquisition, the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Carrols' credit agreement and the redemption and discharge of Carrols' outstanding senior notes. 
 On June 17, 2024, the Borrowers entered into a tenth amendment to the credit agreement governing our Credit Facilities (the Second 2024 Amendment ). The Second 2024 Amendment repriced our Term Loan B from an interest rate equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR plus 2.25 to an interest rate equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus 1.75 and reduced the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan B facility from 5,912 million to 4,750 million using a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 6.125 First Lien Senior Notes due 2029 (defined below). There were no changes to the maturity of the Term Loan B following this repricing and all other terms are substantially unchanged. 
 On June 17, 2024, the Borrowers entered into an indenture in connection with the issuance of 1,200 million of 6.125 first lien senior notes due June 15, 2029 (the 6.125 First Lien Senior Notes due 2029 ). No principal payments are due until maturity and interest is paid semi-annually. The net proceeds from the offering of the 6.125 First Lien Senior Notes due 2029 were used to refinance a portion of the Term Loan B, pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. 
 On September 13, 2024, the Borrowers entered into an indenture in connection with the issuance of 500 million of 5.625 first lien senior notes due September 15, 2029 (the 5.625 First Lien Senior Notes due 2029 ). No principal payments are due until maturity and interest is paid semi-annually. The net proceeds from the offering of the 5.625 First Lien Senior Notes due 2029, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem in full our outstanding 5.75 first lien senior notes due 2025 and pay related fees and expenses. 
 On August 31, 2023, the RBI board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization wherein RBI may purchase up to 1,000 million of RBI common shares until September 30, 2025. Repurchases under RBI s authorization will be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. If RBI repurchases any RBI common shares, pursuant to the partnership agreement, Partnership will, immediately prior to such repurchase, make a distribution to RBI on its Class A 
 56

 common units in an amount sufficient for RBI to fund such repurchase. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, RBI did not repurchase any RBI common shares. As of September 30, 2024, RBI had 500 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization. 
 We generally provide applicable deferred taxes based on the tax liability or withholding taxes that would be due upon repatriation of cash associated with unremitted earnings. We will continue to monitor our plans for such cash and related foreign earnings but our expectation is to continue to provide taxes on unremitted earnings that we expect to distribute. 
 On June 20, 2024, Canada enacted tax legislation to restrict the deduction of excessive interest and financing expenses EIFEL which is effective for taxation years beginning on or after October 1, 2023. As a result, we expect to have restricted interest and financing tax deductions for the current fiscal year, which will increase our cash taxes commencing in 2025. 
 Debt Instruments and Debt Service Requirements

In addition, based on SOFR as of September 30, 2024, net cash settlements that we expect to receive on our 4,120 million interest rate swaps are estimated to be approximately 106 million for the next twelve months. Based on the amounts outstanding at September 30, 2024, required debt service for the next twelve months on all of the Senior Notes outstanding is approximately 337 million in interest payments and no principal payments.

 Comparative Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 1,022 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 920 million during the same period in the prior year. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by an increase in segment income in TH, BK, PLK, INTL and FHS, the inclusion of RH segment income, and an increase in cash provided for working capital, partially offset by an increase in income tax payments and an increase in interest payments. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used for investing activities was 616 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11 million during the same period in the prior year. This change was primarily driven by the Carrols Acquisition, an increase in capital expenditures and payments for the acquisition of non-Carrols restaurants from franchisees. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used for financing activities was 365 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 774 million during the same period in the prior year. The change in cash used for financing activities was driven primarily by an increase in proceeds from long-term debt and the non-recurrence of distributions to RBI for repurchases of RBI common shares in the current year, partially offset by an increase in repayments of long-term debt, including debt assumed in the Carrols Acquisition. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no significant changes to our contractual obligations as disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K except as described herein and in Note 4 Carrols Acquisition in the notes to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 
 Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Finally, our future results will depend upon various other risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC and Canadian securities regulatory authorities on February 22, 2024, as well as other materials that we from time to time file with, or furnish to, the SEC or file with Canadian securities regulatory authorities. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this section and elsewhere in this report. Other than as required under securities laws, we do not assume a duty to update these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or circumstances, changes in expectations or otherwise.
