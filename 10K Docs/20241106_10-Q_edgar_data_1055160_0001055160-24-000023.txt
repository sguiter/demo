 million of purchased residential whole loans, at fair value were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and settled after period-end. 
 
 The Company s residential whole loans are primarily comprised of: (i) loans to finance (or refinance) one-to-four family residential properties that are not considered to meet the definition of a Qualified Mortgage in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Non-QM loans ), (ii) short-term business purpose loans collateralized by residential properties made to non-occupant borrowers that generally intend to rehabilitate or construct residential housing and then refinance or sell the properties Single-family transitional loans ), (iii) short-term business purpose loans collateralized by multifamily properties, typically with a loan balance below million, made to non-occupant borrowers that generally intend to moderately rehabilitate or stabilize and then refinance or sell the properties Multifamily transitional loans (collectively with Single-family transitional loans, Transitional loans, also sometimes referred to as Rehabilitation loans or Fix and Flip loans ), (iv) business purpose loans to finance (or refinance) non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential properties that are rented to one or more tenants Single-family rental loans and, collectively with Transitional loans, Business purpose loans ), (v) loans primarily secured by residential real estate that were generally either non-performing or re-performing at acquisition Legacy RPL/NPL loans and (vi) loans on investor properties that conform to the standards for purchase by a federally chartered corporation, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac ( Agency eligible investor loans, which are included in Other loans ). Residential whole loans are initially recorded at their purchase price (or amount funded for originated loans). Interest income is accrued based on each loan s current interest-bearing balance and current interest rate. Interest income on loans acquired at a premium/discount to par is recorded each period based on the contractual coupon net of any amortization of premium or accretion of discount, adjusted for actual prepayment activity. For loans acquired with related servicing rights retained by the seller, interest income is reported net of related servicing costs. 
 
 For loans acquired prior to the second quarter of 2021 for which the fair value option was not elected, an allowance for credit losses is recorded at acquisition, and maintained on an ongoing basis, for all credit losses expected over the life of the respective loan. Any required credit loss allowance would reduce the net carrying value of the loan with a corresponding charge to earnings, and may increase or decrease over time. Judgments are required in determining any allowance for credit loss, including assumptions regarding the loan cash flows expected to be collected, the value of the underlying collateral and the ability of the Company to collect on any other forms of security, such as a personal guaranty provided either by the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower. 
 
 Income recognition is suspended, and interest accruals are reversed against income, for loans at the earlier of the date on which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful (i.e., such loans are placed on nonaccrual status). For nonaccrual loans, interest income is recorded when interest payments are received. Interest accruals are resumed when the loan becomes contractually current. A loan is written off when it is no longer realizable and/or it is legally discharged. 
 
 Charge-offs to the allowance for loan losses occur when losses are confirmed through the receipt of cash or other consideration from the completion of a sale; when a modification or restructuring takes place in which we grant a concession to a borrower or agree to a discount in full or partial satisfaction of the loan; when we take ownership and control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan; when loans are reclassified as other investments; or when significant collection efforts have ceased and it is highly likely that a loss has been realized. 
 The aggregate allowance for credit losses is equal to the sum of the losses expected over the life of each respective loan. Expected losses are generally calculated based on the estimated probability of default and loss severity of loans in the portfolio, which involves projecting each loan s expected cash flows based on their contractual terms, expected prepayments, and estimated default and loss severity rates. The expected losses in these projected cash flows are not discounted. The default and severity rates were estimated based on the following steps: (i) obtained the Company s historical experience through an entire economic cycle for each loan type or, to the extent the Company did not have sufficient historical loss experience for a given loan type, publicly available data derived from the historical loss experience of certain banks, which data the Company believes is generally representative of its portfolio, (ii) obtained historical economic data (U.S. unemployment rates and home price

 or less to creditworthy borrowers. The Company believes that amounts paid to acquire these loans represent fair market value at the date of acquisition. Loans considered credit deteriorated are initially recorded at their purchase price on a net basis, after establishing an initial allowance for credit losses (their initial cost basis is equal to their purchase price plus the initial allowance for credit losses). Subsequent to acquisition, the gross recorded amount for these loans reflects the initial cost basis, plus accretion/amortization of interest income, less principal and interest cash flows received. These credit deteriorated loans are presented on the Company s consolidated balance sheets at carrying value, which reflects the recorded cost basis reduced by any allowance for credit losses. Interest income on such loans purchased is recorded each period based on the contractual coupon net of accretion/amortization of the difference between their cost basis and unpaid principal balance UPB ), subject to the Company s nonaccrual policy. 
 
 Loans Held-for-Sale 
 
 For loans for which the fair value option was not elected, once a decision has been made to sell loans previously classified as held for investment, such loans are considered held-for-sale and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. 
 
 Residential Whole Loans at Fair Value 
 
 Certain of the Company s residential whole loans are presented at fair value on its consolidated balance sheets as a result of a fair value election made at the time of acquisition or origination. The Company generally considers accounting for these loans at fair value to be more reflective of the expected pattern of returns from these loans under current economic conditions. The Company determines the fair value of its residential whole loans held at fair value after considering portfolio valuations obtained from third-parties that specialize in providing valuations of residential mortgage loans and trading activity observed in the marketplace. Subsequent changes in fair value are reported in current period earnings and presented in Net (loss)/gain on residential whole loans measured at fair value through earnings on the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Interest income is recorded on these loans based on their yield and is presented as part of interest income in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. Cash outflows associated with loan-related advances made by the Company on behalf of the borrower are included in the basis of the loan and are reflected in unrealized gains or losses reported each period. Income and costs associated with originating loans on which the fair value option was elected are recorded in other income and expense, respectively, in the period in which they are earned or incurred.

The features in these awards related to the attainment of TSR over a specified period constitute a market condition, which impacts the amount of compensation expense recognized for these awards. Specifically, the uncertainty regarding the achievement of the market condition was reflected in the grant date fair value of the RSUs, which is recognized as compensation expense over the relevant vesting period. The amount of compensation expense recognized is not dependent on whether the market condition was or will be achieved.

 Lima One had reached an agreement, or was in the process of reaching an agreement, on certain state and local governmental incentives, in connection with its agreement to lease new office space for its headquarters in Greenville, SC based on certain anticipated capital expenditures and anticipated job creation. However, this lease agreement was terminated prior to commencement and primarily all of the incentives will, therefore, require renegotiation. These incentives are generally recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentive will be received and that the Company will comply with the conditions specified in the related agreement. These incentives have commitment terms of up to and may be subject to clawback if the commitments are not fulfilled. No material amounts related to any incentives have been recognized through September 30, 2024.

 (1) Weighted average is calculated based on the interest bearing principal balance of each loan within the related category. For loans acquired with servicing rights released by the seller, interest rates included in the calculation do not reflect loan servicing fees. For loans acquired with servicing rights retained by the seller, interest rates included in the calculation are net of servicing fees. 
 (2) LTV represents the ratio of the total unpaid principal balance of the loan to the estimated value of the collateral securing the related loan as of the most recent date available, which may be the origination date. Excluded from the calculation of weighted average LTV are certain low value loans secured by vacant lots, for which the LTV ratio is not meaningful. 60+ LTV has been calculated on a consistent basis. 
 (3) Excludes loans for which no Fair Isaac Corporation FICO score is available. 
 (4) For Single-family and Multifamily transitional loans, the LTV presented is the ratio of the maximum unpaid principal balance of the loan, including unfunded commitments, to the estimated after repaired value of the collateral securing the related loan, where available. For certain Single-family transitional loans, totaling million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and certain Multifamily transitional loans, totaling million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, an after repaired valuation was not available. For these loans, the weighted average LTV is calculated based on the current unpaid principal balance and the as-is value of the collateral securing the related loan. 
 (5) Excluded from the table above are approximately million of Residential whole loans, at fair value for which the closing of the purchase transaction had not occurred as of December 31, 2023.

 Commercial REO 
 
 In December 2023, the Company received a interest in an entity which owns a newly constructed industrial property as part of the negotiated settlement of a delinquent commercial mortgage loan. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company received and interests, respectively, in additional VIEs through foreclosure of a multifamily property and a senior living facility underlying delinquent commercial mortgage loans. Each of these entities was determined to be a VIE but the Company was not determined to be the primary beneficiary; as a result, the investments in the entities are considered equity method investments. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a and million loss, respectively, based on updated valuations of the property acquired in 2023, which the Company entered into an agreement to sell in May 2024.

The entities generally do not own any other significant assets or carry any significant liabilities, except that entities contain properties encumbered by third-party financing. The property acquired in 2023 is considered held-for-sale, while the properties foreclosed in 2024 are considered held-for-investment.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were impairment charges recorded by the Company on its investments in loan origination partners.

 For certain of the Company s investments, the interests acquired to date by the Company generally do not have a readily determinable fair value. Consequently, the Company accounts for these interests (including any acquired options and warrants) in loan originators initially at cost. The carrying value of these investments will be adjusted if it is determined that an impairment has occurred or if there has been a subsequent observable transaction in either the investee company s equity securities or a similar security that provides evidence to support an adjustment to the carrying value. In addition, for certain partners, options or warrants have also been acquired that provide the Company the ability to increase the level of its investment if certain conditions are met. At the end of each reporting period, or earlier if circumstances warrant, the Company evaluates whether the nature of its interests and other involvement with the investee entity requires the Company to apply equity method accounting or consolidate the results of the investee entity with the Company s financial results.

 of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders within the permitted timeframe. If the Company fails to distribute during each calendar year, or by the end of January following the calendar year in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year, at least the sum of (i) 85 of its REIT ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95 of its REIT capital gain income for such year, and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, the Company would be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the amounts actually distributed. To the extent that the Company incurs interest, penalties or related excise taxes in connection with its tax obligations, including as a result of its assessment of uncertain tax positions, such amounts will be included in Operating and Other Expense on the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 In addition, the Company has elected to treat certain of its subsidiaries as TRS. In general, a TRS may hold assets and engage in activities that the Company cannot hold or engage in directly and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate-related business. Generally, a domestic TRS is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. Given that a portion of the Company s business is conducted through one or more TRS, the net taxable income earned by its domestic TRS, if any, is subject to corporate income taxation. To maintain the Company s REIT election, no more than 20 of the value of the Company s assets at the end of each calendar quarter may consist of stock or securities in TRS. For purposes of the determination of U.S. federal and state income taxes, the Company s subsidiaries that elected to be treated as TRS record current or deferred income taxes based on differences (both permanent and timing) between the determination of their taxable income and net income under GAAP. 
 
 Based on its analysis of any potentially uncertain tax positions, the Company concluded that it does not have any material uncertain tax positions that meet the relevant recognition or measurement criteria as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 or September 30, 2023. As of the date of this filing, the Company s tax returns for tax years 2021 through 2023 are open to examination.

 Realization of the Company s DTAs at September 30, 2024 is dependent on several factors, including generating sufficient taxable income to utilize net operating loss NOL carryforwards and generating sufficient capital gains in future periods prior to the expiration of capital loss carryforwards. The Company determines the extent to which realization of the deferred assets is not expected to be more likely than not and establishes a valuation allowance accordingly. 
 
 No net deferred tax benefit was recorded by the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, related to the net taxable losses in TRS entities, since a valuation allowance for the full amount of the associated deferred tax asset at the ends of those periods was recognized as its recovery was not considered more likely than not. The related NOL carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely, until fully utilized. The Company s estimate of net DTAs could change in future periods to the extent that actual or revised estimates of future taxable income change from current expectations. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company s federal NOL carryforward from prior years was million, which may be carried forward indefinitely. If certain substantial changes in the Company s ownership occur, there could be an annual limitation on the amount of the carryforwards that can be utilized.

 Amounts deferred under the Deferred Plans are considered to be converted into stock units of the Company. Stock units do not represent stock of the Company, but rather are a liability of the Company that changes in value as would equivalent shares of the Company s common stock. Deferred compensation liabilities are settled in cash at the termination of the deferral period, based on the value of the stock units at that time. The Deferred Plans are non-qualified plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and, as such, are not funded.

 (3) Amounts represent simple average values of the properties underlying residential whole loans held at fair value. 
 Changes in market conditions, as well as changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value, could result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value of residential whole loans. Loans valued using a discounted cash flow model are most sensitive to changes in the discount rate assumption, while loans valued using the liquidation model technique are most sensitive to changes in the current value of the underlying properties and the liquidation timeline. Increases in discount rates, default rates, loss severities, or liquidation timelines, either in isolation or collectively, would generally result in a lower fair value measurement, whereas increases in the current or expected value of the underlying properties, in isolation, would result in a higher fair value measurement. In practice, changes in valuation assumptions may not occur in isolation and the changes in any particular assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which could offset or amplify the impact on the overall valuation.

 billion and billion are included in Residential whole loans and REO with a carrying value of approximately million and million are included in Other assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheets, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate carrying value of Senior Bonds issued by consolidated VIEs was billion and billion, respectively. These Senior Bonds are disclosed as Securitized debt and are included in Financing agreements on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The holders of the securitized debt have no recourse to the general credit of the Company, but the Company does have the obligation, under certain circumstances, to repurchase assets from the VIE upon the breach of certain representations and warranties with respect to the residential whole loans sold to the VIE. In the absence of such a breach, the Company has no obligation to provide any other explicit or implicit support to any VIE. 
 
 The Company concluded that the entities created to facilitate the loan securitization transactions are VIEs. The Company completed an analysis of whether each VIE created to facilitate the securitization transactions should be consolidated by the Company, based on consideration of its involvement in each VIE, including the design and purpose of the SPE, and whether its involvement reflected a controlling financial interest that resulted in the Company being deemed the primary beneficiary of each VIE. In determining whether the Company would be considered the primary beneficiary, the following factors were assessed: 
 whether the Company has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE; and 
 whether the Company has a right to receive benefits or absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE. 
 
 Based on its evaluation of the factors discussed above, including maintaining certain rights in each entity including rights to direct loss mitigation activities and its involvement in the purpose and design of the entity, the Company determined that it was required to consolidate each VIE created to facilitate the loan securitization transactions. 
 
 The Company also invests in securities issued by SPEs that may be VIEs. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these SPEs, because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance, and therefore does not consolidate them. For these entities, the Company s maximum exposure to loss is the amortized cost basis of the securities it owns, and it does not provide any liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other commitments to these entities. For more information on the Company s investments in securities, see Note 4.

These assets, excluding certain loans originated and held by Lima One, and certain of the Company s REO assets, are directly owned by certain trusts established by the Company to acquire the loans and entities established in connection with the Company s loan securitization transactions. The Company has assessed that these entities are required to be consolidated (see Notes 3 and 5(a)).

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to MFA Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries as the Company, MFA, we, us, or our, unless we specifically state otherwise or the context otherwise indicates. 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Forward Looking Statements 
 
 When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in future filings with the SEC or in press releases or other written or oral communications, statements which are not historical in nature, including those containing words such as will, believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, plan, continue, intend, should, could, would, may, the negative of these words or similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act and, as such, may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

Business/General 
 
 We are a specialty finance company that invests in and finances residential mortgage assets. We invest, on a leveraged basis, in residential whole loans, residential mortgage securities and other real estate assets. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lima One, a leading nationwide originator and servicer of business purpose loans (or BPLs), we also originate and service business purpose loans for real estate investors. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return. We are an internally-managed real estate investment trust. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had total assets of approximately 11.2 billion, of which 9.0 billion, or 81 , represented residential whole loans. Our residential whole loans include primarily: (i) loans to finance (or refinance) one-to-four family residential properties that are not considered to meet the definition of a Qualified Mortgage in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Non-QM loans ), (ii) short-term business purpose loans collateralized by residential properties made to non-occupant borrowers that generally intend to rehabilitate or construct residential housing and then refinance or sell the properties Single-family transitional loans ), (iii) short-term business purpose loans collateralized by multifamily properties, typically with a loan balance below 10 million, made to non-occupant borrowers that generally intend to rehabilitate or stabilize and then refinance or sell the properties Multifamily transitional loans (collectively, Transitional loans, also sometimes referred to as Rehabilitation loans or Fix and Flip loans ), (iv) business purpose loans to finance (or refinance) non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential properties that are rented to one or more tenants Single-family rental loans and, collectively with Transitional loans, Business purpose loans ), (v) loans primarily secured by residential real estate that were generally either non-performing or re-performing at acquisition Legacy RPL/NPL and (vi) loans on investor properties that conform to the standards for purchase by a federally chartered corporation, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac ( Agency eligible investor loans, which are included in Other loans ). In addition, at September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.1 billion or 10 of total assets invested in securities, including Agency MBS, Term notes backed by MSR collateral, CRT securities and Non-Agency MBS. 
 
 The results of our business operations are affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income and the market value of our assets, liabilities and hedges that are accounted for at fair value through earnings, which is driven by numerous factors, including the supply and demand for residential mortgage assets in the marketplace, the terms and availability of adequate financing, general economic and real estate conditions (both on a national and local level), the impact of government actions in the real estate and mortgage sector, and the credit performance of our credit sensitive residential mortgage assets. Changes in these factors, or uncertainty in the market regarding the potential for changes in these factors, can result in significant changes in the value and/or performance of our investment portfolio. Further, our GAAP results may be impacted by market volatility, resulting in changes in market values of certain financial instruments for which changes in fair value are recorded in net income each period, including certain residential whole loans, securitized debt and Swaps. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense), the level of loan delinquencies, which may result in changes in the amount of non-accrual loans, and prepayment speeds, the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties. Interest rates and conditional prepayment rates (or CPRs) (which is an annualized measure of the amount of unscheduled principal prepayments on an asset as a percentage of the asset balance), vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our financial results are impacted by estimates of credit losses that are required to be recorded when loans that are not accounted for at fair value through net income are acquired or originated, as well as changes in these credit loss estimates that will be required to be made periodically. 
 
 With respect to our business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (i) the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase; (ii) the value of certain of our residential mortgage assets and securitized debt to decline; (iii) coupons on our adjustable-rate assets to reset, on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; (iv) prepayments on our assets to decline, thereby slowing the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts, and 
 63 

Table of Con tents 

 slowing our ability to redeploy capital to generally higher-yielding investments; and (v) the value of our derivative hedging instruments, if any, to increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (i) the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease; (ii) the value of certain of our residential mortgage assets and securitized debt, to increase; (iii) coupons on our adjustable-rate assets, on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates; (iv) prepayments on our assets to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts, and accelerating the redeployment of our capital to generally lower yielding investments; and (v) the value of our derivative hedging instruments, if any, to decrease. Further, changes in credit spreads will also impact the valuation of our residential whole loans and securitized debt, which could result in volatility in GAAP earnings. In addition, our borrowing costs and credit lines are further affected by the type of collateral we pledge and general conditions in the credit market. 
 
 Our investments in residential mortgage assets expose us to credit risk, meaning that we are generally subject to credit losses due to the risk of delinquency, default and foreclosure on the underlying real estate collateral. Our investment process for credit sensitive assets focuses primarily on quantifying and pricing credit risk. With respect to investments in Business purpose and Non-QM loans, we believe that sound underwriting standards, including low LTVs at origination, significantly mitigate our risk of loss. Further, we believe the discounted purchase prices paid on Legacy RPL/NPL loans mitigate our risk of loss in the event that we receive less than 100 of the par value of these investments. 
 
 Premiums arise when we acquire an MBS or loan at a price in excess of the aggregate principal balance of the mortgages securing the MBS (i.e., par value) or when we acquire residential whole loans at a price in excess of their aggregate principal balance. Conversely, discounts arise when we acquire an MBS or loan at a price below the aggregate principal balance of the mortgages securing the MBS or when we acquire residential whole loans at a price below their aggregate principal balance. Accretable purchase discounts on these investments are accreted to interest income. Premiums paid to purchase loans are amortized against interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method, adjusted for actual prepayment activity. An increase in the prepayment rate, as measured by the CPR, will typically accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on these assets. 
 
 CPR levels are impacted by, among other things, conditions in the housing market, new regulations, government and private sector initiatives, interest rates, availability of credit to home borrowers, underwriting standards and the economy in general. In particular, CPR represents the annualized constant rate of principal repayment in excess of scheduled principal amortization. CPRs on our residential mortgage securities and whole loans may differ significantly. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average CPRs on certain of our loan portfolios were: 9.6 for Single-family rental loans, 11.3 for Non-QM loans, and 8.0 for Legacy RPL/NPL loans. In addition, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, the repayment rate (which includes both scheduled and unscheduled repayments of principal) was 63.5 for our Single-family transitional loans and 20.1 for our Multifamily transitional loans. 
 
 It is generally our business strategy to hold our residential mortgage assets as long-term investments. On at least a quarterly basis, excluding investments for which the fair value option has been elected or for which specialized loan accounting is otherwise applied, we assess our ability and intent to continue to hold each asset and, as part of this process, we monitor our investments in securities that are designated as AFS for impairment. A change in our ability and/or intent to continue to hold any of these securities that are in an unrealized loss position, or a deterioration in the underlying characteristics of these securities, could result in our recognizing future impairment charges or a loss upon the sale of any such security. 
 
 Our residential mortgage investments have longer-term contractual maturities than our non-securitization related financing liabilities, and the interest rates we pay on our non-securitization related financings will typically change at a faster pace than the interest rates we earn on our investments. In order to reduce this interest rate risk exposure, we may enter into derivative instruments, which currently include Swaps.

 Recent Market Conditions and Our Strategy 
 
 The third quarter of 2024 delivered strong returns for fixed income markets as the Federal Reserve began its long anticipated rate cutting cycle, cutting the target for the Fed Funds rate by 50 basis points on September 18 and signaling the prospect of additional cuts to come. During the quarter, the two-year Treasury yield fell approximately 110 basis points and the ten-year Treasury yield fell approximately 60 basis points, which resulted in the reversal of the 26-month inversion of the yield curve. 
 
 During the third quarter, we generated GAAP earnings of 0.38 per basic common share and Distributable Earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, of 0.37 per basic common share. During the quarter, our GAAP book value remained essentially flat at 13.77 per common share and our Economic book value increased approximately 1 to 14.46 per common share, and we declared dividends of 0.35 per common share. We added approximately 565.2 million of residential mortgage loans and 293.9 million of Agency MBS with an average coupon of approximately 9.4 and 5.5 , respectively, and we completed two securitizations collateralized by 245.4 million of performing Legacy RPL/NPL loans and 398.0 million of Non-QM loans. Subsequent to quarter-end, we issued two securitizations collateralized by 423.8 million of primarily non-performing Legacy RPL/NPL loans and 214.7 million UPB of Transitional loans. During the quarter, Lima One originated Business purpose loans with a maximum unpaid principal balance of 312.3 million. Delinquency on our Residential whole loans increased modestly during the quarter from 6.5 at June 30, 2024 to 6.7 at September 30, 2024. The increase was driven primarily by an increase from 3.0 to 3.5 on our Non-QM loans, and an increase from 4.6 to 5.5 on our Multifamily transitional loans. Subsequent to quarter-end, Multifamily transitional loan delinquency increased to 8.1 as of October 31, 2024, as an additional net 32.6 million of loans, primarily to one sponsor, went from 30 days delinquent to 60 or more days delinquent. Following our decision made earlier in the year to refocus Lima One s resources away from multifamily lending, and in light of the softening we have seen in multifamily housing over the last several quarters, we expect to see continued heightened levels of delinquency and a commensurate risk of credit losses in our Multifamily transitional loan portfolio over the next several quarters. 
 
 Third quarter 2024 portfolio activity and impact on financial results 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our residential mortgage asset portfolio, which includes residential whole loans and REO, and Securities, at fair value, was approximately 10.3 billion, compared to 10.2 billion at June 30, 2024.

 At September 30, 2024, our total recorded investment in residential whole loans and REO was 9.2 billion, or 88.9 of our residential mortgage asset portfolio. Of this amount, 4.2 billion are Non-QM loans, 1.5 billion are Single-family rental loans, 1.2 billion are Single-family transitional loans, 1.1 billion are Multifamily transitional loans and 1.1 billion are Legacy RPL/NPL loans. Loan acquisition activity of 565.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 243.6 million of Single-family transitional loans (including draws), 236.2 million of Non-QM loans, 76.6 million of Single-family rental loans and 8.8 million of Multifamily transitional loans (including draws). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized approximately 157.4 million of residential whole loan interest income on our consolidated statements of operations, representing an effective yield of 6.74 , with Single-family transitional loans generating an effective yield of 9.53 , Multifamily transitional loans generating an effective yield of 8.20 , Single-family rental loans generating an effective yield of 6.52 , Non-QM loans generating an effective yield of 5.47 and Legacy RPL/NPL loans generating an effective yield of 7.75 . All new loans and 85 of our total loan portfolio are measured at fair value as a result of the election of the fair value option at acquisition or origination. Included in earnings in Other Income/(Loss), net are net gains/losses on these loans of 143.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we had REO with an aggregate carrying value of 127.1 million and 108.0 million, respectively, which is included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

 At September 30, 2024, we held 1.1 billion of Securities, at fair value, including 993.5 million of Agency MBS, 54.5 million of MSR-related assets, 68.2 million of CRT securities and 23.8 million of Non-Agency MBS. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were 293.9 million purchases of Agency MBS securities and 8.7 million sales of a CRT security. The net yield on our Securities, at fair value was 6.48 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.03 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a reversal of provision for credit losses on residential whole loans held at carrying value of 1.9 million. The total allowance for credit losses recorded on residential whole loans held at carrying value at September 30, 2024 was 10.7 million. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we completed two securitizations collateralized by 245.4 million UPB of Legacy RPL/NPL loans and 398.0 million of Non-QM loans. These securitizations provided longer term, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market financing. During the second quarter, we called one of our securitizations issued in 2021 and repaid the remaining 68.1 million amount. Subsequent to the third quarter, we completed one additional securitization collateralized by 423.8 million UPB of Legacy RPL/NPL loans. During the quarter, interest rates exhibited significant volatility, but ended the quarter only modestly higher, and credit spreads tightened. The net impact on the value of our investment portfolio resulted in net mark-to-market gains in our GAAP financial results. We continue to closely follow the actions of the Federal Reserve regarding the path and timing of changes in interest rates and the impact such rate changes would be expected to have on levels of inflation, the overall economic environment and our business. 
 
 Our GAAP book value per common share was 13.77 as of September 30, 2024. Book value per common share was 13.80 as of June 30, 2024. Economic book value per common share, a non-GAAP financial measure of our financial position that adjusts GAAP book value by the amount of unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on our residential whole loans and securitized debt held at carrying value, was 14.46 as of September 30, 2024, an increase from 14.34 as of June 30, 2024. The slight decrease in GAAP book value during the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflects dividends declared on our common stock in excess of GAAP comprehensive income. The increase in Economic book value during the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflects GAAP earnings in excess of dividends declared on our common stock and increases in the fair value of our mortgage loans held at carrying value, partially offset by changes in the estimated fair value of our securities and our securitized debt at carrying value. For additional information regarding the calculation of Economic book value per share, including a reconciliation to GAAP book value per share, refer to Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

Tax Considerations 
 
 Current period estimated taxable income 
 
 We estimate that for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our REIT taxable income was approximately 81.6 million. 
 
 Key differences between GAAP net income and REIT Taxable Income 
 
 Residential Whole Loans and Securities 
 
 The determination of taxable income attributable to residential whole loans and securities is dependent on a number of factors, including principal payments, defaults, loss mitigation efforts and loss severities. In estimating taxable income for such investments during the year, management considers estimates of the amount of discount expected to be accreted. Such estimates require significant judgment and actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 Potential timing differences can arise with respect to the accretion of discount and amortization of premium into income as well as the recognition of gain or loss for tax purposes as compared to GAAP. For example: a) while our REIT uses fair value accounting for GAAP in some instances, it generally is not used for purposes of determining taxable income; b) impairments generally are not recognized by us for income tax purposes until the asset is written-off or sold; c) capital losses may only be recognized by us to the extent of its capital gains; capital losses in excess of capital gains generally are carried over 
 68 

Table of Con tents 

 by us for potential offset against future capital gains; and d) tax hedge gains and losses resulting from the termination of Swaps by us generally are amortized over the remaining term of the Swap. 
 Securitization 
 
 Generally, securitization transactions for GAAP and tax can be characterized as either sales or financings, depending on transaction type, structure and available elections. For GAAP purposes, our securitizations have been treated as on-balance sheet financing transactions. For tax purposes, they have been characterized as both financing and sale transactions. 
 
 Where a securitization has been characterized as a sale, gain or loss is recognized for tax purposes. In addition, we own or may in the future acquire interests in securitization and/or re-securitization trusts, in which several of the classes of securities are or will be issued with original issue discount (or OID). As the holder of the retained interests in the trust, for tax purposes we generally will be required to include OID in our current gross interest income over the term of the applicable securities as the OID accrues. The rate at which the OID is recognized into taxable income is calculated using a constant rate of yield to maturity, with realized losses impacting the amount of OID recognized in REIT taxable income once they are actually incurred. REIT taxable income may be recognized in excess of economic income (i.e., OID) or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from these assets, thereby affecting our dividend distribution requirement to stockholders. 
 
 For securitization and/or re-securitization transactions that were treated as a sale of the underlying collateral for tax purposes, the unwinding of any such transaction will likely result in taxable income or loss. Given that securitization and re-securitization transactions are typically accounted for as financing transactions for GAAP purposes, such income or loss is not likely to be recognized for GAAP. As a result, the income recognized from securitization and re-securitization transactions may differ for tax and GAAP purposes. 
 
 Whether our investments are held by our REIT or one of its Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (TRS) 
 
 We estimate that for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net TRS taxable income will be 36.3 million. Net income or loss generated by our TRS subsidiaries is included in consolidated GAAP net income, but may not be included in REIT taxable income in the same period. REIT taxable income generally does not include taxable income of the TRS unless and until it is distributed to the REIT. For example, because our securitization transactions that are treated as a sale for tax purposes are undertaken by a domestic TRS, any gain or loss recognized on the sale is not included in our REIT taxable income until it is distributed by the TRS. Similarly, the income earned from loans, securities, REO and other investments held by our domestic TRS is excluded from REIT taxable income until it is distributed by the TRS. Net income of our foreign domiciled TRS subsidiaries is included in REIT taxable income as if distributed to the REIT in the taxable year it is earned by the foreign domiciled TRS. A TRS may carry forward its net taxable losses indefinitely as net operating losses to offset up to 80 of its taxable income in future tax years, but REIT taxable income generally does not include the net taxable loss of a TRS unless the TRS liquidates for tax purposes. 
 
 Consequently, our REIT taxable income calculated in a given period may differ significantly from our GAAP net income. 

Regulation 
 
 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (or the CFPB) has broad authority over a wide range of consumer financial products and services, including mortgage lending and servicing. One portion of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (or Mortgage Reform Act), contains underwriting and servicing standards for the mortgage industry, restrictions on compensation for mortgage loan originators, and various other requirements related to mortgage origination and servicing. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act grants enforcement authority and broad discretionary regulatory authority to the CFPB to prohibit or condition terms, acts or practices relating to residential mortgage loans that the CFPB finds abusive, unfair, deceptive or predatory, as well as to take other actions that the CFPB finds are necessary or proper to ensure responsible affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers. The Dodd-Frank Act also affects the securitization of mortgages (and other assets) with requirements for risk retention by securitizers and requirements for regulating rating agencies. 
 
 Numerous regulations have been issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, including regulations regarding mortgage loan servicing, underwriting and loan originator compensation, and others could be issued in the future. As a result, we are unable to fully predict at this time how the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as other laws or regulations that may be adopted in the future, will affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the environment for repurchase financing and other forms of borrowing, the investing environment for Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and/or residential mortgage loans, the securitization industry, Swaps and other derivatives. We believe that the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated 
 69 

Table of Con tents 

 thereunder are likely to continue to increase the economic and compliance costs for participants in the mortgage and securitization industries, including us. 
 
 In addition, certain court rulings may call into question the CFPB s authority and other rules promulgated during CFPB s self-funding structure. For example, in October 2022, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion in Community Financial Services Association of America, et al. v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, et al. , concluding that the CFPB s funding structure unconstitutionally violates the Appropriations Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and vacated the payday lending rule that was the subject of challenge. On May 16, 2024, the Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit's decision in the Community Financial case and upheld the CFPB's funding mechanism as constitutionally permissible. However, future litigation and court rulings may still cast uncertainty on the CFPB s authority and funding mechanism. Any such uncertainty could adversely impact the cash flow on mortgage loans. 
 
 The Federal Housing Finance Agency (or FHFA) and both houses of Congress have discussed and considered various measures intended to restructure the U.S. housing finance system and the operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Congress may continue to consider legislation that would significantly reform the country s mortgage finance system, including, among other things, eliminating Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and replacing them with a single new MBS insurance agency. Many details remain unsettled, including the scope and costs of the agencies guarantee and their affordable housing mission, some of which could be addressed even in the absence of large-scale reform. 
 
 While the likelihood of enactment of major mortgage finance system reform in the short term remains uncertain, it is possible that the adoption of any such reforms could adversely affect the types of assets we can buy, the costs of these assets and our business operations. A reduction in the ability of mortgage loan originators to access Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to sell their mortgage loans may adversely affect the mortgage markets generally and adversely affect the ability of mortgagors to refinance their mortgage loans. In addition, any decline in the value of securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may affect the value of MBS in general.

 General 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, we had net income available to our common stock and participating securities of 40.0 million, or 0.38 per basic common share and 0.37 per diluted common share, compared to net income available to common stock and participating securities of 33.7 million, or 0.32 per basic and diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2024. The increase in net income available to common stock and participating securities in the current period primarily reflects a higher Other income/(loss), net, which increased by 10.4 million to 40.3 million for the current quarter, compared to an Other income/(loss), net of 29.8 million in the immediately prior quarter, partially offset by lower Net Interest Income after Reversal/(Provision) for Credit Losses and a higher provision for income taxes. The increase in Other income/(Loss) net was primarily driven by higher mark-to-market results in the current period on our residential whole loans, securities and other portfolio investments, partially offset by losses on derivatives used for risk management purposes and securitized debt that are measured at fair value through earnings. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends primarily upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the corresponding interest rates earned or paid. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense), the level of loan delinquencies, which may result in changes in the amount of non-accrual loans, and prepayment speeds on our investments. Interest rates and CPRs (which measure the amount of unscheduled principal prepayment on a bond or loan as a percentage of its unpaid balance) vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. 
 
 The changes in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities and their related yields and costs are discussed in greater detail below under Interest Income and Interest Expense. 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, our net interest spread and margin (including the impact of swaps) were 2.18 and 3.00 , respectively, compared to a net interest spread and margin (including the impact of swaps) of 2.16 and 3.01 , respectively, for the second quarter of 2024. Our net interest income decreased by 2.9 million and was 50.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 53.5 million for the second quarter of 2024. For the third quarter of 2024, net interest income, which does not include the benefit of swap carry, includes lower net interest income from our residential whole loan portfolio of 6.3 million, compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower asset yields and average balances, partially offset by lower average financing agreement balances. Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 also includes approximately 2.8 million of additional interest income from other investments and lower net interest income from our Securities, at fair value portfolio.

 Analysis of Net Interest Income 
 
 The following table sets forth certain information about the average balances of our assets and liabilities and their related yields and costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 . Average yields are derived by dividing annualized interest income by the average amortized cost of the related assets, and average costs are derived by dividing annualized interest expense by the daily average balance of the related liabilities, for the periods shown. The yields and costs include premium amortization and purchase discount accretion, which are considered adjustments to interest rates.

 (1) Yields presented throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are calculated using average amortized cost data for residential whole loans and securities, which excludes unrealized gains and losses. For GAAP reporting purposes, securities purchases and sales are reported on the trade date. Average amortized cost data used to determine yields is calculated based on the settlement date of the associated purchase or sale as interest income is not earned on purchased assets and continues to be earned on sold assets until settlement date. 
 (2) Includes average interest-earning cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. 
 (3) Collateralized financing agreements include the following: mark-to-market asset based financing and non-mark-to-market asset based financing. For additional information, see Note 6, included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 (2) Reflects annualized interest expense divided by average balance of agreements with mark-to-market collateral provisions (repurchase agreements), agreements with non-mark-to-market collateral provisions, and securitized debt. Cost of funding shown in the table above includes the impact of the net carry (the difference between swap interest income received and swap interest expense paid) on our Swaps. While we have not elected hedge accounting treatment for Swaps and, accordingly, net carry is not presented in interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations, we believe it is appropriate to allocate net carry to the cost of funding to reflect the economic impact of our Swaps on the funding costs shown in the table above. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, this decreased the overall funding cost by 131 basis points for our Residential whole loans, 101 basis points for our Business purpose loans, 175 basis points for our Non-QM loans, and 56 basis points for our Legacy RPL/NPL loans. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, this decreased the overall funding cost by 128 basis points for our Residential whole loans, 92 basis points for our Business purpose loans, 163 basis points for our Non-QM loans, and 107 basis points for our Legacy RPL/NPL loans. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, this decreased the overall funding cost by 132 basis points for our Residential whole loans, 227 basis points for our Business purpose loans, 168 basis points for our Non-QM loans, and 238 basis points for our Legacy RPL/NPL loans. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, this decreased the overall funding cost by 140 basis points for our Residential whole loans, 235 basis points for our Business purpose loans, 177 basis points for our Non-QM loans, and 251 basis points for our Legacy RPL/NPL loans. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, this decreased the overall funding cost by 143 basis points for our Residential whole loans, 240 basis points for our Business purpose loans, 176 basis points for our Non-QM loans, and 254 basis points for our Legacy RPL/NPL loans. For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, this decreased the overall funding cost by 144 basis points for our Residential whole loans, 222 basis points for our Business purpose loans, 175 basis points for our Non-QM loans, and 297 basis points for our Legacy RPL/NPL loans. For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, this decreased the overall funding cost by 127 basis points for our Residential whole loans, 198 basis points for our Business purpose loans, 161 basis points for our Non-QM loans, and 251 basis points for our Legacy RPL/NPL loans.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, this decreased the overall funding cost by 171 basis points. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, this decreased the overall funding cost by 190 basis points. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, this decreased the overall funding cost by 179 basis points.

 Interest Income 
 
 Interest income on our residential whole loans for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 8.3 million, or 5.0 , to 157.4 million, compared to 165.7 million for the second quarter of 2024. This decrease primarily reflects a decrease in the yield to 6.74 for the third quarter of 2024 from 6.92 for the second quarter of 2024, and a 232.9 million decrease in the average balance of this portfolio to 9.3 billion for the third quarter of 2024 from the second quarter of 2024. This decrease in residential whole loan interest income was partially offset by an increase in other interest earning assets of 2.8 million and securities, at fair value of 1.1 million. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Our interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 2.0 million, or 1.5 , to 131.3 million, from 133.3 million for the second quarter of 2024. This decrease primarily reflects a decrease in the average balance and rates on financing agreements on residential whole loans as well as zero interest expense for the third quarter for the 6.25 convertible notes due in June 2024 (or Convertible Senior Notes), which we fully repaid in June 2024, partially offset by higher average balance and rates on securitized debt and higher average balances for securities repurchase agreements. 
 Provision for Credit Losses on Residential Whole Loans Held at Carrying Value 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a reversal of provision for credit losses on residential whole loans held at carrying value of 1.9 million compared to a reversal of provision for credit losses of 1.1 million for the second quarter of 2024. The reversal of provision recorded in the current period and in the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects minor changes to modeling assumptions and the run-off of loans held at carrying value. 
 Provision for Credit Losses on Other Assets 
 For the third quarter of 2024, we had no provision for credit losses on Other Assets. For the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses on Other Assets of 26,000 related to an uncollectible receivable from an unaffiliated third-party servicer.

 Other Income/(Loss), net 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, Other Income/(Loss), net was 40.3 million, compared to Other Income/(Loss), net of 29.8 million for the second quarter of 2024. The components of Other Income/(Loss), net for the third and second quarter of 2024 are summarized in the table below:

 Operating and Other Expense 
 
 Operating and other expenses are composed of compensation and benefits, other general and administrative, loan servicing and other related operating expenses and amortization of Lima One intangible assets. 
 
 Compensation and benefits expenses are composed of salaries, annual bonus, stock-based awards, long-term incentives, Lima One sales commissions, related payroll taxes, medical insurance, 401(k) matching and other benefits expenses. Compensation and benefits expense increased by 0.7 million to 22.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 21.7 million for the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by the accrual of executive severance pay, partially offset by a reduction in employee stock-based compensation, annual bonus, and Lima One salary and commission expenses. 
 
 Other general and administrative expenses are comprised of leasing and other office expenses, professional fees, insurance costs, board of directors fees, and miscellaneous expenses. Other general and administrative expenses of 11.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 were higher when compared to 10.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, primarily as a result of impairment on a software asset at Lima One and fair value adjustments on the deferred compensation plan for the board of directors, partially offset by lower professional fees at Lima One and software expense at our corporate offices. 
 
 Loan servicing and other related operating expenses are composed of non-recoverable advances, upfront costs on securitization and other fees related to our residential whole loan activities. These expenses decreased compared to the prior quarter period by approximately 0.2 million, or 2.5 , primarily due to lower expenses recognized related to loan securitization activities.

 General 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income available to our common stock and participating securities of 88.7 million, or 0.85 per basic common share and 0.83 per diluted common share, compared to a net loss available to our common stock and participating securities of (34.2) million, or (0.34) per basic and diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net income available to common stock and participating securities in the current period primarily reflects an increase in Other Income/(Loss), net of 105.6 million from the prior year period, as well as higher net interest income of 21.9 million, partially offset by higher operating and other expense and a higher provision for income taxes from the prior year period. Other Income/(Loss) was higher primarily due to a gain of 148.3 million on residential whole loans measured at fair value in the current period compared with losses in the prior period, partially offset by a loss of 108.4 million on securitized debt measured at fair value in the current period compared with a gain in the prior year period and a lower gain on derivatives used for risk management purposes. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net interest spread and margin were 2.14 and 2.96 , respectively, compared to a net interest spread and margin of 2.02 and 2.89 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest income increased by 21.9 million, or 16.9 , to 151.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net interest income of 130.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income, which does not include the benefit of swap carry, includes higher net interest income from our residential whole loan portfolio of 22.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher asset yields and average balances on our residential whole loan portfolio, partially offset by an increase in financing rates and average balances for our securitized debt and an increase in financing rates for our financing agreement borrowings. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes approximately 5.1 million of additional interest income from cash and other interest earning assets compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Analysis of Net Interest Income 
 
 The following table sets forth certain information about the average balances of our assets and liabilities and their related yields and costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Average yields are derived by dividing annualized interest income by the average amortized cost of the related assets, and average costs are derived by dividing annualized interest expense by the daily average balance of the related liabilities, for the periods shown. The yields and costs include premium amortization and purchase discount accretion which are considered adjustments to interest rates.

 (1) Yields presented throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are calculated using average amortized cost data for residential whole loans and securities, which excludes unrealized gains and losses. For GAAP reporting purposes, securities purchases and sales are reported on the trade date. Average amortized cost data used to determine yields is calculated based on the settlement date of the associated purchase or sale as interest income is not earned on purchased assets and continues to be earned on sold assets until settlement date. 
 (2) Includes average interest-earning cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. 
 (3) Collateralized financing agreements include the following: mark-to-market asset based financing and non-mark-to-market asset based financing. For additional information, see Note 6, included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 (4) Includes both securitized debt, at carrying value, and securitized debt, at fair value. 
 (5) Net interest rate spread reflects the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and average cost of funds. 
 (6) Reflects the impact of positive or negative swap carry. Positive swap carry results when income from the receive leg of a swap is greater than the expense on the pay leg. Negative swap carry results when income from the receive leg is less than the expense on the pay leg. 
 (7) Net interest margin reflects annualized net interest income (including net swap carry) divided by average interest-earning assets.

 (2) Reflects annualized interest expense divided by average balance of agreements with mark-to-market collateral provisions (repurchase agreements), agreements with non-mark-to-market collateral provisions, and securitized debt. Cost of funding shown in the table above includes the impact of the net carry (the difference between swap interest income received and swap interest expense paid) on our Swaps. While we have not elected hedge accounting treatment for Swaps, and accordingly, net carry is not presented in interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations, we believe it is appropriate to allocate net carry to the cost of funding to reflect the economic impact of our Swaps on the funding costs shown in the table above. For the period ended September 30, 2024, this decreased the overall funding cost by 130 basis points for our Residential whole loans, 98 basis points for our Business purpose loans, 169 basis points for our Non-QM loans, and 89 basis points for our Legacy RPL/NPL loans. For the period ended September 30, 2023, this decreased the overall funding cost by 138 basis points for our Residential whole loans, 221 basis points for our Business purpose loans, 171 basis points for our Non-QM loans, and 268 basis points for our Legacy RPL/NPL loans.

 Interest Income 
 
 Interest income on our residential whole loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 92.7 million, or 23.9 , to 480.8 million, compared to 388.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase primarily reflects an increase in the yield to 6.76 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and a 0.9 billion increase in the average balance of this portfolio to 9.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest income on our Securities, at fair value portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 12.2 million to 41.4 million from 29.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase primarily reflects an increase in the average amortized cost of the portfolio of 300.2 million, primarily due to purchases of Agency MBS, partially offset by a decrease in the net yield on our Securities, at fair value portfolio to 6.88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.77 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Our interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 88.0 million, or 28.8 , to 393.7 million, from 305.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase primarily reflects the higher overall average balances and financing rates of our securitized debt, higher average balances for securities repurchase agreements and 7.9 million and 3.3 million of interest expense related to our 8.875 Senior Notes issued in January 2024 and 9.00 Senior Notes that were issued in April 2024, respectively. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses on Residential Whole Loans Held at Carrying Value 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a reversal of provision for credit losses on residential whole loans held at carrying value of 3.5 million compared to a reversal of provision for credit losses of 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The reversal of provision for the current period primarily reflects the run-off of loans held at carrying value and minor changes to modeling assumptions. 
 Provision for Credit Losses on Other Assets 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses on Other Assets of 1.1 million, related to an uncollectible receivable from an unrelated third party servicer. No such provision was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Income/(Loss), net 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other Income/(Loss), net was 92.5 million, compared to an Other Income/(Loss), net of (13.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The components of Other Income/(Loss), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized in the table below:

 Operating and Other Expense 
 
 Operating and other expenses are composed of compensation and benefits, other general and administrative, loan servicing and other related operating expenses and amortization of Lima One intangible assets. 
 
 84 

Table of Con tents 

 Compensation and benefits expenses are composed of salaries, annual bonus, stock-based awards, long-term incentives, Lima One sales commissions, related payroll taxes, medical insurance, 401(k) matching and other benefits expenses. Compensation and benefits expense increased 3.2 million to 69.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the accrual of executive severance pay, Lima One salary and long-term incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by a reduction in Lima One commission expense. 
 
 Other general and administrative expenses are comprised of leasing and other office expenses, professional fees, insurance costs, board of directors fees, and miscellaneous expenses. Other general and administrative expenses increased by 3.0 million to 34.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 31.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of impairment on a software asset at Lima One and higher costs associated with IT infrastructure at our corporate offices, partially offset by lower depreciation. 
 
 Loan servicing and other related operating expenses are composed of non-recoverable advances, upfront costs on securitization and other fees related to our residential whole loan activities. These expenses decreased compared to the prior year period by approximately 1.9 million, or 7.1 , primarily due to lower expenses recognized related to loan securitization activities.

 Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to non-GAAP Distributable Earnings 
 
 Distributable earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, within the meaning of Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Distributable earnings is determined by adjusting GAAP net income/(loss) by removing certain unrealized gains and losses, primarily on residential mortgage investments, associated debt, and hedges that are, in each case, accounted for at fair value through earnings, certain realized gains and losses, as well as certain non-cash expenses and securitization-related transaction costs. Realized gains and losses arising from loans sold to third-parties by Lima One shortly after the origination of such loans are included in Distributable earnings. The transaction costs are primarily comprised of costs only incurred at the time of execution of our securitizations and include costs such as underwriting fees, legal fees, diligence fees, bank fees and other similar transaction related expenses. These costs are all incurred prior to or at the execution of our securitizations and do not recur. Recurring expenses, such as servicing fees, custodial fees, trustee fees and other similar ongoing fees are not excluded from distributable earnings. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company changed the determination of Distributable earnings to exclude depreciation, for consistency with the reporting of similar non-cash expenses; this change has been reflected in all periods presented. Management believes that the adjustments made to GAAP earnings result in the removal of (i) income or expenses that are not reflective of the longer term performance of our investment portfolio, (ii) certain non-cash expenses, and (iii) expense items required to be recognized solely due to the election of the fair value option on certain related residential mortgage assets and associated liabilities. Distributable earnings is one of the factors that our Board of Directors considers 
 85 

Table of Con tents 

 when evaluating distributions to our shareholders. Accordingly, we believe that the adjustments to compute Distributable earnings specified below provide investors and analysts with additional information to evaluate our financial results. 
 
 Distributable earnings should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Distributable earnings does not represent and should not be considered as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operating activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP, and our calculation of this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

 Reconciliation of GAAP Book Value per Common Share to non-GAAP Economic Book Value per Common Share 
 
 Economic book value is a non-GAAP financial measure of our financial position. To calculate our Economic book value, our portfolios of Residential whole loans and securitized debt held at carrying value are adjusted to their fair value, rather than the carrying value that is required to be reported under the GAAP accounting model applied to these financial instruments. These adjustments are also reflected in the table below in our end of period stockholders equity. Management considers that Economic book value provides investors with a useful supplemental measure to evaluate our financial position as it reflects the impact of fair value changes for all of our investment activities, irrespective of the accounting model applied for GAAP reporting purposes. Economic book value does not represent and should not be considered as a substitute for Stockholders Equity, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and our calculation of this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of our GAAP book value per common share to our non-GAAP Economic book value per common share as of the quarterly periods below:

 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (or ASU 2023-07). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 primarily require entities to disclose certain significant segment expenses and other segment items on both an annual and interim basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 will have a significant impact on our financial statement disclosures. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (or ASU 2023-09). The amendments in ASU 2023-09 primarily require entities to disclose more details about their income tax rate, expense and payments. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect that the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a significant impact on our financial statement disclosures. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 General 
 
 Our principal sources of cash generally consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements and other collateralized financings, payments of principal and interest we receive on our investment portfolio, cash generated from our operating results including loan sales and, to the extent such transactions are entered into, proceeds from capital market and structured financing transactions. Our most significant uses of cash are generally to pay principal and interest on our financing transactions, to 
 87 

Table of Con tents 

 purchase and originate residential mortgage assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, to fund our operations, to meet margin calls and to make other investments that we consider appropriate. 
 We seek to employ a diverse capital raising strategy under which we may issue capital stock and other types of securities. To the extent we raise additional funds through capital market transactions, we currently anticipate using the net proceeds from such transactions to acquire additional residential mortgage-related assets, consistent with our investment policy, and for working capital, which may include, among other things, the repayment of our financing transactions. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to access the capital markets at any particular time or on any particular terms. We have available for issuance an unlimited amount (subject to the terms and limitations of our charter) of common stock, preferred stock, depository shares representing preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, rights and/or units pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement and, at September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.0 million shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to our Discount Waiver, Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan (or DRSPP) shelf registration statement. The Company did not issue any shares pursuant to its DRSPP during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 On February 29, 2024, we entered into a distribution agreement pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 300 million, from time to time, through various sales agents in transactions deemed to be at-the-market offerings under federal securities laws (or the ATM Program). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares of common stock through the ATM Program. At September 30, 2024, 300 million remained available under the distribution agreement. 
 
 On February 29, 2024, we announced our Board had authorized a new 200 million stock repurchase program with respect to our common stock, which will be in effect through the end of 2025. The new stock repurchase program supersedes the prior stock repurchase program in its entirety. Refer to Part II, Item 2 for further information about the stock repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any share of common stock through the stock repurchase program. At September 30, 2024, 200 million remained available under the current Board authorization for the purchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program. 
 
 In February 2023, our Board authorized a repurchase program for our Convertible Senior Notes pursuant to which we could repurchase up to 100 million of our Convertible Senior Notes. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we repurchased 39.9 million principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes for 39.8 million and recorded a loss of 0.1 million to Other Income/(Loss), net on the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 20.4 million principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes for 20.2 million and recorded a gain of 0.1 million to Other Income/(Loss), net on the consolidated statement of operations. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Convertible Senior Notes matured and we repaid the amount in full. 
 
 Financing Agreements 
 
 Our borrowings under financing agreements include a combination of shorter and longer term arrangements. Certain of these arrangements are collateralized directly by our residential mortgage investments or otherwise have recourse to us, while securitized debt financing is non-recourse financing. Further, certain of our financing agreements contain terms that allow the lender to make margin calls on us based on changes in the value of the underlying collateral securing the borrowing. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.8 billion of total unpaid principal balance related to asset-backed financing agreements with mark-to-market collateral provisions and 6.0 billion of total unpaid principal balance related to asset-backed financing agreements that do not include mark-to-market collateral provisions. Repurchase agreements and other forms of collateralized financing are uncommitted and renewable at the discretion of our lenders, and, as such, our lenders could determine to reduce or terminate our access to future borrowings at virtually any time. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under our master repurchase agreements, as such terms relate to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all securities that are the subject of repurchase transactions, generally conform to the terms contained in the standard master repurchase agreement published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (or SIFMA) or the global master repurchase agreement published by SIFMA and the International Capital Market Association. In addition, each lender typically requires that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions, which differ by lender, may include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, required haircuts (or the percentage amount by which the collateral value is contractually required to exceed the loan amount), purchase price maintenance requirements, requirements that all controversies related to the repurchase agreement be litigated in a particular jurisdiction and cross default and setoff provisions. Other non-repurchase agreement financing arrangements also contain provisions governing collateral maintenance. At September 30, 2024, we had unused financing capacity of approximately 3.1 billion across our financing arrangements for all collateral types. 
 88 

Table of Con tents 

 Margin calls are typically determined by our counterparties based on their assessment of changes in the fair value of the underlying collateral and in accordance with the agreed upon haircuts specified in the transaction confirmation with the counterparty. We address margin call requests in accordance with the required terms specified in the applicable agreement and such requests are typically satisfied by posting additional cash or collateral on the same business day. We review margin calls made by counterparties and assess them for reasonableness by comparing the counterparty valuation against our valuation determination. When we believe that a margin call is unnecessary because our assessment of collateral value differs from the counterparty valuation, we typically hold discussions with the counterparty and attempt to resolve the matter. If this is not successful, we will look to resolve the dispute based on the remedies available to us under the terms of the repurchase agreement, which in some instances may include the engagement of a third-party to review collateral valuations. For certain other agreements that do not include such provisions, we could resolve the matter by substituting collateral as permitted in accordance with the agreement or otherwise request the counterparty to return the collateral in exchange for cash to unwind the financing. For additional information regarding our various types of financing arrangements, including those with non-mark-to-market terms and the haircuts for those agreements with mark-to-market collateral provisions, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had a total of 3.6 billion of residential whole loans and securities and 10.3 million of restricted cash pledged to our financing counterparties excluding securitized debt. We expect that we will continue to pledge residential mortgage assets as part of certain of our ongoing financing arrangements. When the value of our residential mortgage assets pledged as collateral experiences rapid decreases, margin calls under our financing arrangements could materially increase, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. Additionally, if one or more of our financing counterparties choose not to provide ongoing funding, our ability to finance our long-maturity assets would decline or otherwise become available on possibly less advantageous terms. Further, when liquidity tightens, our counterparties to our short term arrangements with mark-to-market collateral provisions may increase their required collateral cushion (or margin) requirements on new financings, including financings that we roll with the same counterparty, thereby reducing our ability to use leverage. Access to financing may also be negatively impacted by ongoing volatility in financial markets, thereby potentially adversely impacting our current or future lenders ability or willingness to provide us with financing. In addition, there is no assurance that favorable market conditions will exist to permit us to consummate additional securitization transactions if we determine to seek that form of financing. 
 
 Our ability to meet future margin calls will be affected by our ability to use cash or obtain financing from unpledged collateral, the amount of which can vary based on the market value of such collateral, our cash position and margin requirements. Our cash position fluctuates based on the timing of our operating, investing and financing activities and is managed based on our anticipated cash needs. (See our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Interest Rate Risk included under Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.)

 Cash Flows and Liquidity for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by 14.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting: 182.8 million used in our investing activities, 108.8 million provided by our financing activities and 88.7 million provided by our operating activities. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our debt-to-equity multiple was 4.8 times compared to 4.5 times at December 31, 2023. Our recourse leverage multiple at September 30, 2024 was 1.8 times compared to 1.7 times at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had borrowings under asset-backed financing agreements of 3.5 billion, of which 2.5 billion were secured by residential whole loans, 918.5 million were secured by securities and 40.7 million were secured by REO. In addition, at September 30, 2024, we had securitized debt of 5.3 billion in connection with our loan securitization transactions. At December 31, 2023, we had borrowings under asset-backed financing agreements of 3.6 billion, of which 2.9 billion were secured by residential whole loans, 622.6 million were secured by securities and 25.2 million were secured by REO. In addition, at December 31, 2023, we had securitized debt of 4.8 billion in connection with our loan securitization transactions. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 182.8 million was used in our investing activities. We utilized 2.0 billion for acquisitions and origination of residential whole loans, loan related investments and capitalized advances. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 1.6 billion of principal payments on residential whole loans and loan related investments, 407.7 million of proceeds from the sale of residential whole loans, and 68.2 million of proceeds on sales of REO. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we utilized 404.0 million for acquisitions of securities and received cash proceeds of 45.6 million from sales of securities and other assets and 44.6 million from principal payments on our securities. 
 
 In connection with our repurchase agreement financings and Swaps, we routinely receive margin calls/reverse margin calls from our counterparties and make margin calls to our counterparties. Margin calls and reverse margin calls, which requirements vary over time, may occur daily between us and any of our counterparties when the value of collateral pledged changes from the amount contractually required. The value of securities pledged as collateral fluctuates reflecting changes in: (i) the face (or par) value of our assets; (ii) market interest rates and/or other market conditions; and (iii) the market value of our Swaps. Margin calls/reverse margin calls are satisfied when we pledge/receive additional collateral in the form of additional assets and/or cash.

 We are subject to various financial covenants under our financing agreements, which include minimum liquidity and net worth requirements, net worth decline limitations and maximum debt-to-equity ratios. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 107.9 million for cash dividends on our common stock and dividend equivalents and paid cash dividends of 24.7 million on our preferred stock. On September 12, 2024, we declared our third quarter 2024 dividend on our common stock of 0.35 per share; on October 31, 2024, we paid this dividend, which totaled approximately 36.0 million, including dividend equivalents of approximately 0.3 million.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 We seek to manage our risks related to interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds, market value and the credit quality of our assets while, at the same time, seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive total returns through ownership of our capital stock. While we do not seek to avoid risk, we seek, consistent with our investment policies, to: assume risk that can be quantified based on management s judgment and experience and actively manage such risk; earn sufficient returns to justify the taking of such risks; and maintain capital levels consistent with the risks that we undertake. 

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk on our residential mortgage assets, as well as on our liabilities. Changes in interest rates can affect our net interest income and the fair value of our assets and liabilities. 
 In general, when interest rates change, borrowing costs on our financing agreements will change more quickly than the yield on our assets. In a rising interest rate environment, the borrowing costs may increase faster than the interest income on our assets, thereby reducing our net income. In order to mitigate compression in net income based on such interest rate movements, we may use Swaps or other derivatives to lock in a portion of the net interest spread between assets and liabilities or otherwise hedge interest rate risk. 
 
 When interest rates change, the fair value of our residential mortgage assets could change at a different rate than the fair value of our liabilities. We measure the sensitivity of our portfolio to changes in interest rates by estimating the duration of our assets and liabilities. Duration is the approximate percentage change in fair value for a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. In general, our assets have higher duration than our liabilities, and in order to reduce this exposure, we have historically used Swaps and other derivatives to reduce the gap in duration between our assets and liabilities. 
 
 The fair value of our re-performing and non-performing residential whole loans is in part dependent on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, past and expected delinquency status of the borrower as well as the level of interest rates. For certain loans that were re-performing or non-performing when purchased and where the borrower has brought the loan current, but nonetheless may be less likely to prepay due to weak credit history and/or high LTV, we believe these loans exhibit positive duration. We estimate the duration of these residential whole loans using management s assumptions. 
 
 The fair value of our Business purpose and Non-QM loans is typically dependent on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, as well as the level of interest rates. Because these loans are primarily newly or recently originated performing loans, we believe these investments exhibit positive duration. Given the short duration of our Single-family and Multifamily transitional loans, we believe the fair value of these loans exhibits little sensitivity to changes in interest rates. We estimate the duration of these Business purpose and Non-QM loans using management s assumptions. 
 
 The fair value of our non-performing residential whole loans is typically dependent on the value of the underlying real estate collateral and the time required for collateral liquidation. Since neither the value of the collateral nor the liquidation timeline is generally sensitive to interest rates, we believe their fair value exhibits little sensitivity to interest rates. We estimate the duration of our non-performing residential whole loans using management s assumptions. 
 
 We estimate the duration of our Agency MBS using a third-party financial model, which takes into account key characteristics of securities, market data, and assumptions based on management s view and observed empirical data. 
 
 We use derivative financial instruments, including Swaps, as part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy. Such instruments are used to economically hedge against future interest rate increases on our financing transactions. While use of such derivatives does not extend the maturities of our borrowings under repurchase agreements, they do, in effect, lock in a fixed rate of interest over their term for a corresponding amount of our repurchase agreement financings that are hedged, or otherwise act as a hedge against changes in interest rates.

 Shock Table 
 
 The information presented in the following Shock Table projects the potential impact of sudden parallel changes in interest rates on our portfolio value, including the impact of Swaps and securitized debt and other fixed rate debt, based on the assets in our investment portfolio at September 30, 2024. All changes in value are measured as the percentage change from the projected portfolio value under the base interest rate scenario at September 30, 2024.

 (1) Assets in our portfolio include residential whole loans and REO, securities, other portfolio investments, goodwill, intangibles, receivables, and cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. 
 (2) Change in estimated net portfolio value includes the effect of our Swaps, securitized debt, and other fixed-rate debt. 
 
 Certain assumptions have been made in connection with the calculation of the information set forth in the Shock Table and, as such, there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at September 30, 2024. The analysis presented utilizes assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience. Furthermore, while we generally expect to retain the majority of our assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity, future purchases and sales of assets could materially change our interest rate risk profile. It should be specifically noted that the information set forth in the above table and all related disclosure constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the Shock Table above. 
 
 The Shock Table quantifies the potential changes in portfolio value, which includes the value of our derivative and other hedging transactions (if any) and securitized and other fixed rate debt (which are carried at fair value), should interest rates immediately change (i.e., are shocked). The Shock Table presents the estimated impact of interest rates instantaneously rising 50 and 100 basis points, and falling 50 and 100 basis points. At September 30, 2024, the impact on portfolio value was approximated using estimated net effective duration (i.e., the price sensitivity to changes in interest rates), including the effect of securitized and other fixed rate debt, of 1.16 which is the weighted average of 3.51 for our Residential whole loans, 2.68 for our Securities investments, (2.43) for our derivative and other hedging transactions and securitized and other fixed rate debt, and 0.01 for our Other assets and cash and cash equivalents. Estimated convexity (i.e., the approximate change in duration relative to the change in interest rates) of the portfolio was (0.54), which is the weighted average of (0.52) for our Residential whole loans, zero for our derivative and other hedging transactions and securitized and other fixed rate debt, (1.23) for our Securities and zero for our Other assets and cash and cash equivalents.

 Credit Risk 
 
 We are exposed to credit risk through our credit sensitive residential mortgage investments, in particular residential whole loans and certain of our securities investments. We do not believe we are exposed to credit risk in our Agency MBS portfolio. 
 
 Our exposure to credit risk from our credit sensitive investments is discussed in more detail below: 
 
 Residential Whole Loans 
 
 We are exposed to credit risk from our investments in residential whole loans. Credit risk on our residential whole loans is mitigated through our process to underwrite the loan before it is acquired and/or originated and includes an assessment of the borrower s financial condition and ability to repay the loan, nature of the collateral and relatively low LTV, including after-repair LTV for the majority of our Single-family and Multifamily transitional loans. Given the extent of home price appreciation that has occurred since the majority of our loans collateralized by single-family homes were acquired or originated, we estimate that current LTVs have decreased significantly, further mitigating the risk of material credit losses on this portfolio. As a result of higher cap rates and an increasing supply of multifamily units in certain markets, we estimate that current LTVs on certain of our Multifamily transitional loans may have increased since origination, increasing the risk of credit losses on this portfolio. 
 
 Our investment process for Legacy RPL/NPL loans is focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk. Legacy RPL/NPL loans are acquired at purchase prices that are generally discounted to the contractual loan balances based on a number of factors, including the impaired credit history of the borrower and the value of the collateral securing the loan. In addition, as we generally own the mortgage-servicing rights associated with these loans, our process is also focused on selecting a sub-servicer with the appropriate expertise to mitigate losses and maximize our overall return. This involves, among other things, performing due diligence on the sub-servicer prior to their engagement as well as ongoing oversight and surveillance. To the extent that delinquencies and defaults on these loans are higher than our expectation at the time the loans were purchased, the discounted purchase price at which the asset is acquired is intended to provide a level of protection against financial loss. 
 
 The following table presents certain information about our Residential whole loans at September 30, 2024:

 (1) Weighted average is calculated based on the interest bearing principal balance of each loan within the related category. For loans acquired with servicing rights released by the seller, interest rates included in the calculation do not reflect loan servicing fees. For loans acquired with servicing rights retained by the seller, interest rates included in the calculation are net of servicing fees. 
 (2) LTV represents the ratio of the total unpaid principal balance of the loan to the estimated value of the collateral securing the related loan as of the most recent date available, which may be the origination date. For Single-family and Multifamily transitional loans, the LTV presented is the ratio of the maximum unpaid principal balance of the loan, including unfunded commitments, to the estimated after repaired value of the collateral securing the related loan, where available. For certain Single-family transitional loans, totaling 459.2 million, an after repaired valuation was not obtained and the loan was underwritten based on an as is valuation. The LTV of these loans based on the current unpaid principal balance and the valuation obtained during underwriting, is 74 . For certain Multifamily transitional loans, totaling 568.3 million, an after repaired valuation was not obtained and the loan was underwritten based on an as is valuation. The LTV of these loans based on the current unpaid principal balance and the valuation obtained during underwriting, is 72 . Excluded from the calculation of weighted average LTV are certain low value loans secured by vacant lots for which the LTV ratio is not meaningful.

 CRT Securities 
 
 We are exposed to potential credit losses from our investments in CRT securities issued by or sponsored by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. While CRT securities are issued by or sponsored by these GSEs, payment of principal on these securities is not guaranteed. As an investor in a CRT security, we may incur a loss if losses on the mortgage loans in the reference pool exceed the credit enhancement on the underlying CRT security owned by us or if an actual pool of loans experience losses. We assess the credit risk associated with our investments in CRT securities by assessing the current and expected future performance of the associated loan pool. 
 
 Term Notes Backed by MSR Collateral 
 
 We have invested in certain term notes that are issued by SPVs that have acquired rights to receive cash flows representing the servicing fees and/or excess servicing spread associated with certain MSRs. Payment of principal and interest on these term notes is considered by us to be largely dependent on the cash flows generated by the underlying MSRs as this impacts the cash flows available to the SPV that issued the term notes. Credit risk borne by the holders of the term notes is also mitigated by structural credit support in the form of over-collateralization. In addition, credit support is also provided by a corporate guarantee from the ultimate parent or sponsor of the SPV that is intended to provide for payment of interest and principal to the holders of the term notes should cash flows generated by the underlying MSRs be insufficient. 
 Credit Spread Risk 
 
 Credit spreads measure the additional yield demanded by investors in financial instruments based on the credit risk associated with an instrument relative to benchmark interest rates. They are impacted by the available supply and demand for instruments with various levels of credit risk. Widening credit spreads would result in higher yields being required by investors in financial instruments. Credit spread widening generally results in lower values of the financial instruments we hold at that time, but will generally result in a higher yield on future investments with similar credit risk. It is possible that the credit spreads on our assets and liabilities, including hedges, will not always move in tandem. Consequently, changes in credit spreads can result in volatility in our financial results and reported book value. 
 
 Liquidity Risk 
 
 The primary liquidity risk we face arises from financing long-maturity assets with shorter-term borrowings primarily in the form of repurchase agreement financings. We pledge residential mortgage assets and cash to secure our financing agreements. Our financing agreements with mark-to-market collateral provisions require us to pledge additional collateral in the event the market value of the assets pledged decreases, in order to maintain the lenders contractually specified collateral cushion, which is measured as the difference between the loan amount and the market value of the asset pledged as collateral. Should the value of our residential mortgage assets pledged as collateral suddenly decrease, margin calls under our repurchase agreements would likely increase, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. Additionally, if one or more of our financing counterparties chose not to provide ongoing funding, our ability to finance our long-maturity assets would decline or be available on possibly less advantageous terms. Further, when liquidity tightens, our repurchase agreement counterparties may increase our collateral cushion (or margin) requirements on new financings, including repurchase agreement borrowings that we roll with the same counterparty, reducing our ability to use leverage. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had access to various sources of liquidity, including 305.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our sources of liquidity do not include restricted cash. In addition, at September 30, 2024, we had 95.5 million of unencumbered residential whole loans. 
 94 

Table of Con tents 

 Prepayment Risk 
 
 Premiums arise when we acquire an MBS or loan at a price in excess of the aggregate principal balance of the mortgages securing the MBS (i.e., par value) or when we acquire residential whole loans at a price in excess of their aggregate principal balance. Conversely, discounts arise when we acquire an MBS or loan at a price below the aggregate principal balance of the mortgages securing the MBS or when we acquire residential whole loans at a price below their aggregate principal balance. Premiums paid are amortized against interest income and accretable purchase discounts on these investments are accreted to interest income. Purchase premiums, which are primarily carried on our Single-family rental and Non-QM loans, are amortized against interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method, adjusted for actual prepayment activity. An increase in the prepayment rate, as measured by the CPR, will typically accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on these assets. Fees payable by borrowers on the early repayment of certain of our Business purpose and Non-QM loans serve to mitigate the impact on our income of higher prepayment rates. Generally, if prepayments on residential whole loans purchased at significant discounts and not accounted for at fair value are less than anticipated, we expect that the income recognized on these assets will be reduced and impairments and/or credit loss reserves may result. 
 
 In addition, increased prepayments are generally associated with decreasing market interest rates as borrowers are able to refinance their mortgages at lower rates. Therefore, increased prepayments on our investments may accelerate the redeployment of our capital to generally lower yielding investments. Similarly, decreased prepayments are generally associated with increasing market interest rates and may slow our ability to redeploy capital to generally higher-yielding investments. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management, under the direction of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management reviewed and evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. The evaluation was performed under the direction of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to determine the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2024, of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that review and evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s current disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented, were effective as of September 30, 2024. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed, implemented and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s current periodic reports. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

 set forth in the 2023 Form 10-K. However, the risks and uncertainties that the Company faces are not limited to those set forth in the 2023 Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company (or that it currently believes to be immaterial) may also adversely affect the Company s business and the trading price of our securities. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 On February 29, 2024, the Company announced its Board had authorized a new 200 million stock repurchase program with respect to the Company s common stock, which will be in effect through the end of 2025. The Company s prior stock repurchase program, which was adopted in March 2022, had authorized the repurchase of up to 250 million of the Company s common stock and expired on December 31, 2023, with approximately 202.5 million remaining available at the date of expiration. 
 The stock repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares. The timing and extent to which the Company repurchases its shares will depend upon, among other things, market conditions, share price, liquidity, regulatory requirements and other factors, and repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the stock repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means, in accordance with applicable securities laws (including, in the Company s discretion, through the use of one or more plans adopted under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). 
 
 At September 30, 2024, 200 million remained available under the current authorization for the purchase of our common stock under the stock repurchase program. 
 
 We engaged in no share repurchase activity during the third quarter of 2024 pursuant to the stock repurchase program nor did we withhold shares (under the terms of grants under our Equity Compensation Plan (or Equity Plan)) to satisfy tax and payroll withholding obligations resulting from the vesting and settlement of restricted stock awards and/or restricted stock units (RSUs).
