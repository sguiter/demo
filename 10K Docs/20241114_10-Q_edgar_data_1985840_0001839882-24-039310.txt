NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 September 30, 2024 (Unaudited) 

Shares (each such block, a Creation Unit at an initial price per Share
of . Only Authorized Participants may purchase and redeem Shares from the Fund and then only in Creation Units. An Authorized Participant
is an entity that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Trust and the Sponsor. Shares are offered on a continuous
basis to Authorized Participants in Creation Units at NAV. Authorized Participants may then offer to the public, from time to time, shares
from any Creation Unit they create at a per-share market price. The form of Authorized Participant Agreement sets forth the terms and
conditions under which an Authorized Participant may purchase or redeem a Creation Unit. Authorized Participants will not receive from
the Fund, the Sponsor, or any of their affiliates, any fee or other compensation in connection with their sale of Shares to the public.
An Authorized Participant may receive commissions or fees from investors who purchase Shares through their commission or fee-based brokerage
accounts. 

Significant accounting policies of the Fund are as follows: 

Shares from the Fund. The amount of the proceeds required to purchase a Creation Basket will be equal to the
NAV of the Shares in the Creation Basket determined as of 4:00 p.m. (ET) on the day the order to create the basket is received in good
order. 

Authorized Purchasers may redeem Shares from the
Fund only in blocks of Shares called Redemption Baskets. The amount of the redemption proceeds for a Redemption
Basket will be equal to the NAV of the Shares in the Redemption Basket determined as of 4:00 p.m. (ET) on the day the order to redeem
the basket is received in good order. 

The Fund will receive the proceeds from Shares
sold or will pay for redeemed Shares within three business days after the trade date of the purchase or redemption, respectively. The
amounts due from Authorized Purchasers will be reflected in the Fund s statements of assets and liabilities as capital shares receivable.
Amounts payable to Authorized Purchasers upon redemption will be reflected in the Fund s statements of assets and liabilities as
payable for Shares redeemed. 

As outlined in the Trust s Registration
Statement on Form S-1, filed with the SEC on March 18, 2024, Shares represent five Redemption Baskets for the Fund and a
minimum level of Shares. If the Fund experienced redemptions that caused the number of Shares outstanding to decrease to the minimum level
of Shares required to be outstanding, until the minimum number of Shares is again exceeded through the purchase of a new Creation Basket,
there can be no more redemptions by an Authorized Purchaser. 

To determine the value of Bitcoin Futures Contracts,
Global Fund Services uses the settlement price for the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, as reported on the CME. CME Group staff
determines the daily settlements for the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts based on trading activity on CME Globex exchange between
14:59:00 and 15:00:00 Central Time (CT), the settlement period. When a Bitcoin Futures Contract has closed at its daily price fluctuation
limit, that limit price will be the daily settlement price that the CME publishes. The Fund will use the published settlement price to
price its Shares on that day. If the CME halted trading in Bitcoin Futures Contracts for other reasons, including if trading were halted
for an entire trading day or several trading days, the Fund would value its Bitcoin Futures Contracts by using the settlement price that
the CME publishes. Such valuation is generally deemed a Level 1 valuation. 

The value of the Bitcoin held by the Fund will
be determined using a Futures-Based Spot Price (or FBSP methodology. This methodology has been chosen by
the Sponsor specifically to calculate the Fund s NAV, isolating it from data from unregulated bitcoin exchanges. The methodology
to derive the settlement prices of Bitcoin Futures Contracts on the CME involves a calculation that is a function of both the length of
time (the tenor) until each Bitcoin Futures Contract is due for settlement, and the final settlement price for each contract on that day.
The calculation is based on estimating a simple quadratic function to fit the prices across the different tenors and extrapolate this
curve to zero days tenor. This approach is designed to give more importance to contracts that are due for settlement in the near term,
considering that the prices of these near-term contracts are more reliable indicators of the current spot price of bitcoin and are also
more heavily traded. Such Valuation is generally deemed a Level 2 valuation.

Overview/Introduction 

Tidal Commodities Trust I Trust ),
a Delaware statutory trust organized on February 10, 2023, is a series trust currently consisting of one series: Hashdex Bitcoin ETF (f/k/a
Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF) DEFI or the Fund ). The Trust also includes one additional series, the 7RCC Spot Bitcoin and Carbon Credit Futures ETF, which may be publicly offered in the
future. The Fund is a commodity pool. The Fund issues shares of beneficial
interest, called Shares, representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in the Fund. The Fund s investment
objective is for changes in the Shares net asset value NAV to reflect the daily changes of the price of the Nasdaq
Bitcoin Reference Price - Settlement (NQBTCS) (the Benchmark ), less expenses from the Fund s operations. The Benchmark
is designed to track the price performance of bitcoin. The Fund invests in bitcoin, bitcoin futures contracts Bitcoin Futures
Contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. CME ), and cash and cash equivalents. Because the Fund s
investment objective is to track the price of the Benchmark, changes in the price of the Shares may vary from changes in the spot price
of bitcoin. 

The Trust and the Fund operate pursuant to the
Trust s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement ), dated March 10, 2023.
On January 2, 2024, the initial Form S-1 for DEFI was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ).
As noted below, the Fund is the successor to the Predecessor Fund (defined below), which commenced operations in September 2022. The Fund s
shares trade on the NYSE Arca stock exchange NYSE Arca ). The current registration statement for DEFI was declared effective
by the SEC on January 2, 2024 and registered an indeterminate number of Shares. BitGo Trust Company, Inc (the Bitcoin Custodian is the custodian for the Fund s bitcoin holdings; and U.S. Bank, N.A. is the custodian for the Fund s cash and cash equivalents
holdings (the Cash Custodian and together with the Bitcoin Custodian, the Custodians ). 

The Fund is the successor and surviving entity
from the merger (the Merger of the Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (the Predecessor Fund into the Fund. The
Predecessor Fund was a series of the Teucrium Commodity Trust (the Predecessor Trust sponsored by Teucrium Trading, LLC Prior Sponsor ). The Merger closed on January 3, 2024. In connection with the Merger, the Predecessor Fund shareholders
received one Share for each share of the Predecessor Fund they owned prior to the Merger. 

The sponsor of the Trust is Tidal Investments
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor ). The principal office of the Sponsor is Milwaukee, Wisconsin and
the Trust is located at 234 West Florida Street, Suite 203, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53204. The Sponsor is registered as a commodity pool
operator CPO with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC and is a member of the National Futures
Association NFA ). The Fund intends to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Sponsor has
sponsored the Trust since 2023. Sponsoring the Fund will be the Sponsor s first experience in operating an exchange traded product
that invests in crypto-currency futures or directly in bitcoin. The Sponsor s responsibilities are discussed below in the section
entitled The Sponsor s Operations. 

While investors will purchase and sell Shares
through their broker-dealer, the Fund continuously offers creation baskets consisting of 10,000 Shares Creation Baskets at their net asset value NAV to certain financial institutions that have entered into an agreement with the Sponsor Authorized
Purchasers ).

Recent Developments 

Me rg er with Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF 

On January 3, 2024, the Trust completed the Merger
and acquisition of the Predecessor Fund, a series of the Predecessor Trust, into the Fund, a series of the Trust. The Merger was effected
pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Partnership Merger and Liquidation dated as of October 30, 2023 (the Plan of Merger between the Predecessor Trust, on behalf of its Predecessor Fund series, and the Trust, on behalf of its Fund series. 

Pursuant to the Plan of Merger, each Predecessor
Fund shareholder received one share of the Fund for every one share of the Predecessor Fund held immediately before the commencement of
trading on the NYSE Arca on the Closing Date based on the net asset value per share of the Predecessor Fund being equal to the net asset
value per share of the Fund determined immediately prior to the Merger closing. The share price used for the delivery of shares of the
Predecessor Fund was the net asset value per share of the Predecessor Fund determined after the close of business of NYSE Arca on January
2, 2024. Consequently, the Merger resulted in a one-for-one exchange of shares between the Predecessor Fund and the Fund. Further, the
Fund acquired in the Merger all the assets of the Predecessor Fund and assumed all the liabilities of the Predecessor Fund. Effective
the Merger closing, the Plan of Merger caused all of the Predecessor Fund s shares to be cancelled and the Predecessor Fund to be
liquidated. 

The Merger did not materially modify the rights
of Predecessor Fund shareholders with respect to their investment. The Fund has the same investment objective, investment strategies and
investment restrictions, and substantially identical investment risks, as those had by the Predecessor Fund. Following the Merger, the
Fund is now sponsored by the Sponsor, Tidal Investments LLC (f/k/a Toroso Investments LLC), and the Fund is now managed by portfolio managers
employed by the Sponsor. The Fund pays the same management fee rate to the Sponsor, under the same terms, as previously paid by the Predecessor
Fund to Teucrium Trading, LLC, the sponsor of the Predecessor Trust and the Predecessor Fund. 

The Fund s shares commenced trading on the NYSE Arca upon the
effectiveness of the Merger under the ticker symbol DEFI. 

Eff ect of Merger - Conversion to U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF 

On March 26, 2024, the Trust announced that the
Fund would be permitted to have spot bitcoin holdings, and that it would track the Benchmark effective March 27, 2024. The Predecessor
Fund s name was the Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF, and the Fund s name is the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF. Effective as of March 27,
the Fund has a policy to maximize its holdings of physical bitcoin such that it is expected that at least 95 of the Fund s assets
will be invested in spot bitcoin. Up to 5 of the Fund s remaining assets may be invested in CME-traded bitcoin futures contracts
and in cash and cash equivalents.

Market Outlook - The Bitcoin Industry 

Bitcoin is a digital asset that serves as the
unit of account on an open-source, decentralized, peer-to-peer computer network. Bitcoin may be used to pay for goods and services, stored
for future use, or converted to a fiat currency. As of the date of this update, the adoption of bitcoin for these purposes has been limited.
The value of bitcoin is not backed by any government, corporation, or other identified body. 

The value of bitcoin is determined in part by
the supply of (which is limited), and demand for, bitcoin in the markets for exchange that have been organized to facilitate the trading
of bitcoin. By design, the supply of bitcoin is limited to 21 million bitcoins. As of the date of this update, there are approximately
19 million bitcoins in circulation. 

5 

Bitcoin is maintained on the Bitcoin Network.
No single entity owns or operates the Bitcoin Network. The Bitcoin Network is accessed through software and governs bitcoin s creation
and movement. The source code for the Bitcoin Network, often referred to as the Bitcoin Protocol, is open-source, and anyone can contribute
to its development. 

Price movements for bitcoin are influenced by,
among other things, the environment, natural or man-made disasters, governmental oversight and regulation, demographics, economic conditions,
infrastructure limitations, existing and future technological developments, and a variety of other factors now known and unknown, any
and all of which can have an impact on the supply, demand, and price fluctuations in the bitcoin markets. More generally, cryptocurrency
prices may be influenced by economic and monetary events such as changes in interest rates, changes in balances of payments and trade,
U.S. and international inflation rates, currency valuations and devaluations, U.S. and international economic events, and changes in the
philosophies and emotions of market purchasers. Because the Predecessor Fund invested in futures contracts in a single cryptocurrency,
it was not a diversified investment vehicle, and therefore may have been subject to greater volatility than a diversified portfolio of
stocks or bonds or a more diversified commodity or cryptocurrency pool. Likewise, because the Fund invests in spot bitcoin and futures
contracts in a single cryptocurrency, it is not a diversified investment vehicle, and therefore may be subject to greater volatility than
a diversified portfolio of stocks or bonds or a more diversified commodity or cryptocurrency pool. 

Market Risk 

Trading in instruments such as Futures Contracts
will involve the Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell specific amounts of cryptocurrencies at a specified date
in the future. The gross or face amount of the contracts is expected to significantly exceed the future cash requirements of the Fund
as the Fund intends to close out any open positions prior to the contractual expiration date. As a result, the Fund s market risk
is the risk of loss arising from the decline in value of the contracts, not from the need to make delivery under the contracts. The Fund
considers the fair value of derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated
with the commitment by the Fund to purchase a specific cryptocurrency will be limited to the aggregate face amount of the contacts held. 

The exposure of the Fund to market risk will depend
on a number of factors including the markets for the specific cryptocurrency, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates,
the liquidity of the Bitcoin Futures Contracts markets and the relationships among the contracts held by the Fund. 

Credit Risk 

When the Fund enters into futures contracts, it
will be exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. For purposes of credit risk, the counterparty
for the futures contracts traded on the CBOT, ICE and CME is the clearinghouse associated with those exchanges. In general, clearinghouses
are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the non-performance of one of their members,
which should significantly reduce credit risk. Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed
by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. Unlike in the case of exchange traded futures contracts, the counterparty to
an over the counter futures contract is generally a single bank or other financial institution. As a result, there will be greater counterparty
credit risk in over the counter transactions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their financial backers
will satisfy their obligations to the Fund. 

The Sponsor will attempt to manage the credit
risk of the Fund by following certain trading limitations and policies. In particular, the Fund intends to post margin and collateral
and/or hold liquid assets that will be equal to approximately the face amount of the futures contracts it holds. The Sponsor will implement
procedures that will include, but will not be limited to, executing and clearing trades and entering into over the counter transactions
only with parties it deems creditworthy and/or requiring the posting of collateral by such parties for the benefit of each Fund to limit
its credit exposure. 

The CEA requires all FCMs, such as the Fund s
clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds
and account separately for all customers funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by
the staff of the CFTC. The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity
interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades. The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by
FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes
an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA. The
CEA also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC. 

On November 14, 2013, the CFTC published final
regulations that require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity
standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to
market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of
the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust
manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs
of the CFTC and the SROs are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.

StoneX and Phillip Capital serve as the Fund s clearing brokers
to execute futures contracts and provide other brokerage-related services. 

Results of Operations 

The discussion below addresses the material changes in the results
of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

Total expenses for the current and comparative
period are presented both gross and net of any expenses waived or paid by the Prior Sponsor that would have been incurred by the Fund expenses waived by the Prior Sponsor ). For all expenses waived in 2023, the Prior Sponsor is not entitled to reimbursement.
 Total expenses, net is after the impact of any expenses waived by the Prior Sponsor, are presented in the same manner as
previously reported. There is, therefore, no impact to or change in the Net gain or Net loss in any period for the Trust and the Fund
as a result of this change in presentation. 

The Fund is the successor and surviving entity
from the Merger of the Predecessor Fund into the Fund. The Predecessor Fund was a series of the Teucrium Commodity Trust sponsored by
Teucrium Trading, LLC. The Predecessor Fund commenced operations on September 15, 2022. The investment objective of both the Predecessor
Fund and the Fund (for the period from January 3, 2024 to March 26, 2024) was for changes in the Fund s shares net asset
value NAV to reflect the daily changes of the price of the Hashdex U.S. Bitcoin Futures Fund Benchmark (the Prior
Benchmark ), less expenses from such Fund s operations. The Prior Benchmark reflect the average of the closing settlement
prices for the first to expire and second to expire bitcoin futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME ). 

Effective as of March 27, 2024, the Fund s
investment objective and strategy were revised to reflect that the Fund could have spot bitcoin holdings. That is, the Fund s investment
objective is for changes in the Shares NAV to reflect the daily changes of the price of the Nasdaq Bitcoin Reference Price - Settlement
(NQBTCS) (the Benchmark ), less expenses from the Fund s operations. Under normal market conditions, the Fund s
current policy is to maximize its holdings of physical bitcoin such that it is expected that at least 95 of the Fund s assets will
be invested in spot bitcoin. Up to 5 of the Fund s remaining assets may be invested in CME-traded bitcoin futures contracts and
in cash and cash equivalents. 

Performance data from September 15, 2022, to
January 3, 2024, reflects the performance of the Predecessor Fund. Performance from January 4, 2024, to March 26, 2024, reflects the Fund s
performance under its previous investment strategy, which involved investing in futures contracts. Performance data from March 27, 2024,
onward reflect the Fund s current investment strategy. 

On September 30, 2024, the Fund held 14,800 Units
of spot bitcoin with an asset fair value of 9,379,568.

Total net assets for the Fund increased year over
year by 462 , driven by a combination of an increase in shares outstanding of 79,996 shares or 160 and an increase in the NAV per share
of 38.81 or 116 . The change in total net assets year over year was generally due to the interconnected impact of two factors: (i) a
surge in net investors flow to the Fund, evidenced by the 116 increase in shares outstanding, particularly following the approval of
the spot bitcoin ETF in the USA; and (ii) the Bitcoin price appreciation from 26,967.92 per Bitcoin as of September 30, 2023, to 63,329.50
per Bitcoin as of September 30, 2024, representing an approximate 35 increase during the period September 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024.

Net Realized Gain or Loss on Futures Contracts 

Realized gain or loss on trading of commodity
futures contracts is a function of: 1) the change in the price of the particular contracts sold as part of a roll in contracts
as the nearest to expire contracts are exchanged for the appropriate contract given the investment objective of the fund, 2) the change
in the price of particular contracts sold in relation to redemption of shares, 3) the gain or loss associated with rebalancing trades
which are made to ensure conformance to the benchmark, 4) the number of contracts held and then sold for either circumstance aforementioned.
The Fund recognizes the expense for brokerage commissions for futures contract trades on a per trade basis. Unrealized gain or loss on
trading of commodity futures contracts is a function of the change in the price of contracts held on the final date of the period versus
the purchase price for each contract and the number of contracts held in each contract month. The Fund conducts creation and redemption
transactions only for cash, and, with respect to creation transactions, the cash is used to purchase Bitcoin Futures Contracts only. The
Fund will use Bitcoin Futures Contracts for the primary purpose of using such Bitcoin Futures Contracts to acquire physical bitcoin through
Exchange for Physical EFP transactions and to offset cash and receivables for better tracking the Benchmark. The increase in net realized and unrealized gain
on futures contracts was related to the increase in the Fund s net assets and the Bitcoin price appreciation noted above. 

8 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amount of interest income earned
as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher. The increase in interest and other income over these periods was primarily
due to an increase in the investments within short-term Treasury Securities, demand deposits, money market funds and/or investments in
commercial paper. In the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, the amount of interest income earned
as a percentage of daily total net assets was lower. The decrease in interest and other income over these periods was primarily due to
a decrease in the investments within short-term Treasury Securities, demand deposits, money market funds and/or investments in commercial
paper. The Fund seeks to earn interest and other income in investments that may include, but are not
limited to, short-term Treasury Securities, demand deposits, money market funds and investments in commercial paper. These interest rate
levels may be lower or higher than the projected interest rates stated in the prospectuses and thus will impact your breakeven point. 

The increase in management fee paid to the Sponsor
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, is a result of higher Fund
average net assets overall, which was also net of the Sponsor lowering the management fee from 0.94 to 0.90 per annum of the daily NAV
of the Fund effective March 26, 2024. Other than the management fee to the Sponsor the Fund incurred brokerage commissions and trading
fees. Brokerage commissions are recognized on a per-trade basis to each futures contract s or bitcoin share s cost basis.
Trading fees for the Fund are recorded in the statement of operations as broker expenses. The actual amount of trading fees to be incurred
will vary based upon the trading frequency of the Fund. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, most of the expenses incurred
by the Predecessor Fund were associated with the management fee and day-to-day operation of the Fund and the necessary functions related
to regulatory compliance. Those were generally based on contracts, which extend for some period of time and up to one year, or commitments
regardless of the level of assets under management. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Prior Sponsor waived
expenses, which resulted in the Predecessor Fund s annualized net expense ratio of 0.94 , the Prior Sponsor s annualized management
fee. The Sponsor has not elected to waive management fees or other expenses. These factors also explain the decrease in total gross fees
and other expenses excluding management fees, as well as the decrease in total gross expense ratio for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 

The increase in total brokerage commissions for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in futures
contracts purchased, liquidated, and rolled and the purchase of bitcoin due to the relative net increase in shares outstanding and increase
in assets due to the bitcoin price appreciation. The total brokerage commissions for three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
the same period in 2023 were generally stable. 

The graph below shows the actual shares outstanding,
total net assets (or AUM) and net asset value per share (NAV per share) for the Fund from inception to September 30, 2024 and serves to
illustrate the relative changes of these components.

Off Balance Sheet Financing 

The Trust or Fund has no obligations, assets or
liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. Neither the Trust nor the Fund participates
in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest
entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. Neither the Trust nor the
Fund have entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or
commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Fund does not anticipate making use of borrowings
or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. The Fund meets its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds
of the sale of its investments, from the cash and cash equivalents that it intends to hold, and/or from the fee waivers provided by the
Sponsor. The Fund s liquidity needs include redeeming its Shares, providing margin deposits for existing Bitcoin Futures Contracts
or the purchase of additional Bitcoin Futures Contracts, posting collateral for over-the-counter contracts, and paying expenses. 

In order to collateralize positions in Bitcoin
Futures Contracts, a portion of the NAV of the Fund is held in cash and cash equivalents, such as short-term Treasury Securities, demand
deposits, money market funds and investments in commercial paper. A portion of these investments may be posted as collateral in connection
with Bitcoin Futures Contracts. The percentage that cash and cash equivalents bear to the shareholders equity of the Fund varies from
period to period as the market values of the Bitcoin Futures Contracts change. The Fund earned 1,524 and 21,202, respectively, in interest
income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 184,244 and 56,099, respectively, in interest income during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

If the Fund s ability to obtain exposure
to Bitcoin Futures Contracts in accordance with its investment objective is disrupted for any reason, including limited liquidity in the
bitcoin futures market, a disruption to the bitcoin futures market, or as a result of margin requirements or position limits imposed by
the Fund s futures commission merchants, the CME, or the CFTC, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective and
may experience significant losses. Any disruption in the Fund s ability to obtain exposure to Bitcoin Futures Contracts will cause
the Fund s performance to deviate from the performance of Bitcoin Futures Contracts. In addition, the Fund might grow to a size
where a lack of liquidity in the futures market meant that the Fund could not sell enough futures contracts to honour redemption requests. 

A market disruption, such as a government taking
regulatory or other actions that disrupt the market in bitcoin, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position. Unexpected market
illiquidity may cause major losses to investors at any time or from time to time. In addition, the Fund does not intend at this time to
establish a credit facility, which would provide an additional source of liquidity, but instead will rely only on the cash and cash equivalents
that it holds to meet its liquidity needs. The anticipated value of the positions in Benchmark Component Futures Contracts that the Sponsor
will acquire or enter into for the Fund increases the risk of illiquidity. Because Benchmark Component Futures Contracts may be illiquid,
the Fund s holdings may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred
during the period in which positions are being liquidated. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The Trust s critical accounting policies
for the Fund is as follows: 

Basis of Presentation 

Preparation of the financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires the application of appropriate
accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates, and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during
the reporting period of the combined financial statements and accompanying notes. The Trust s application of these policies involves
judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used. 

Cryptocurrency Derivative Transactions 

The Sponsor has determined that the valuation
of cryptocurrency interests that are not traded on a U.S. or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as swaps and other over
the counter contracts) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by the Fund for futures contracts will be provided
by the broker who will use market prices when available, while over the counter contracts will be valued based on the present value of
estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to
their delivery date. Values will be determined on a daily basis. 

Cryptocurrency futures contracts held by the Fund
are recorded on the trade date. All such transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis and marked to market daily. Unrealized
appreciation or depreciation on commodity or cryptocurrency futures contracts are reflected in the statement of operations as the difference
between the original contract amount and the fair market value as of the last business day of the year or as of the last date of the financial
statements. Changes in the appreciation or depreciation between periods are reflected in the statement of operations. Interest on cash
equivalents and deposits are recognized on an accrual basis. The Fund earns interest on funds held at the custodian or other financial
institutions at prevailing market rates for such investments. 

10 

Cash and cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents are cash held at financial
institutions in demand-deposit accounts or highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less at inception.
The Fund reports cash equivalents in the statements of assets and liabilities at market value, or at carrying amounts that approximate
fair value, because of their highly liquid nature and short-term maturities. The Fund has a substantial portion of assets on deposit with
banks. Assets deposited with financial institutions may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. 

Fair Value - Definition and Hierarchy 

In accordance with GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. 

In determining fair value, the Fund uses various
valuation approaches. In accordance with GAAP, a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use
of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the Fund. Unobservable inputs reflect the Fund s assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized
into three levels based on the inputs as follows: 

Level 1 - 
 Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability to access.
Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 financial instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices
that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these financial instruments does not entail a significant
degree of judgment. 

Level 2 - 
 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly
or indirectly. 

Level 3 - 
 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 

The availability of valuation techniques and observable
inputs can vary from financial instrument to financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors including, the type of
financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular
to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market,
the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately
realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation,
those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the financial
instruments existed. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Fund in determining fair value is greatest for financial instruments
categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy, within which the fair value measurement in its entirety
falls, is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The Fund and records derivative activities at
fair value. Gains and losses from derivative contracts are included in the statement of operations. Derivative contracts include futures
contracts related to cryptocurrency prices. Futures, which are listed on a national securities exchange, such as the CME, or reported
on another national market, are generally categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. OTC derivatives contracts (such as forward
and swap contracts) which may be valued using models, depending on whether significant inputs are observable or unobservable, are categorized
in Levels 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Brokerage Commissions 

The Fund recognizes brokerage commissions on a full trade basis. 

Derivative Counterpar ty Ma rg in 

Margin is the minimum amount of funds that must
be deposited by a cryptocurrency interest trader with the trader s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts.
A margin deposit acts to assure the trader s performance of the futures contracts purchased or sold. Futures contracts are customarily
bought and sold on initial margin that represents a small percentage of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract. Because
of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to
the amount invested, are greater than customary in other forms of investment or speculation. As discussed below, adverse price changes
in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin. In addition, the amount of margin required
in connection with a particular futures contract may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract. Brokerage
firms, such as the Fund s clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity or cryptocurrency interest contracts generally
require higher amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves. Over the counter trading generally involves the
extension of credit between counterparties, so the counterparties may agree to require the posting of collateral by one or both parties
to address credit exposure. 

11 

When a trader purchases an option, there is no
margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full. When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she is required
to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount
substantially equal to the current premium for the option. The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted
to reflect the probability that out of the money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in
the futures markets directly. Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in
which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest. 

Ongoing or maintenance margin requirements
are computed each day by a trader s clearing broker. When the market value of a particular open futures contract changes to a point
where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker. If the margin call
is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the trader s position. With respect to the Fund s trading, the
Fund (and not its shareholders personally) are subject to margin calls. 

Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed
certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would,
in the case of some accounts, be aggregated, and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk
of the combined positions. 

Sponsor Fee Allocation of Expenses 

The Sponsor is responsible for investing the assets of the Fund in
accordance with the objectives and policies of the Fund. 

The Fund pays the Sponsor a Management Fee, monthly
in arrears, in an amount equal to 0.90 per annum of the daily NAV of the Fund. The Management Fee is paid in consideration of the Sponsor s
services related to the management of the Fund s business and affairs, including the provision of commodity futures trading advisory
services. Creation with cash may cause the Fund to incur certain costs including brokerage commissions and redemptions of creation units
with cash may result in the recognition of gains or losses that the Fund might not have incurred if it had made redemptions in-kind. The
Fund pays all of its respective brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, NFA fees and give-up fees, and other transaction
related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities for the Fund s investments in CFTC regulated investments.
The Fund also pays all fees and commissions related to the EFP transactions for the sale and purchase of spot bitcoin, including any bitcoin
transaction fees for on-chain transfers of bitcoin. The Fund bears other transaction costs related to the FCM capital requirements on
a monthly basis. The Sponsor pays all of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Fund, generally as
determined by the Sponsor, including but not limited to, fees and expenses of the Administrator, Sub-Administrator, Custodians, Marketing
Agent, Transfer Agent, licensors, accounting and audit fees and expenses, tax preparation expenses, legal fees, ongoing SEC registration
fees, individual Schedule K-1 preparation and mailing fees, and report preparation and mailing expenses. The Fund pays all of its non-recurring
and unusual fees and expenses, if any, as determined by the Sponsor. Non-recurring and unusual fees and expenses are unexpected or unusual
in nature, such as legal claims and liabilities and litigation costs or indemnification or other unanticipated expenses. Extraordinary
fees and expenses also include material expenses which are not currently anticipated obligations of the Fund. Routine operational, administrative
and other ordinary expenses are not deemed extraordinary expenses. 

Income Taxes 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Fund
will be treated as a partnership. Therefore, the Fund does not record a provision for income taxes because the partners report their share
of the Fund s income or loss on their income tax returns. The financial statements reflect the Fund s transactions without
adjustment, if any, required for income tax purposes. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Trust and the Fund maintain disclosure controls

Management of the Sponsor of the Fund Management ),
including Guillermo Trias, the Sponsor s Principal Executive Officer and Ronnie Riven, the Sponsor s Principal Financial Officer,
who perform functions equivalent to those of a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust if the Trust had
any officers, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Trust and the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d- 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of
the end of the period covered by this report, and, based upon that evaluation, concluded that the Trust s and the Fund s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of such period, to ensure that information the Trust is required to disclose in the
reports that it files or submits with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management of the Sponsor, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The scope of the evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures covers the Trust, as well as separately for the Fund. 

12 

The certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer are applicable to the Fund as well as the Trust as a whole. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
