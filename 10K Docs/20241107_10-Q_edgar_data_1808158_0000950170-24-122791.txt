As a result, the Company did t record an allowance for credit losses or other impairment charges for its marketable securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Bristol-Myers Squibb Collaboration and License Agreement In May 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the BMS Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Bristol-Myers Squibb ), pursuant to which the Company and Bristol-Myers Squibb have agreed to collaborate in the research and development of potential new product candidates for the treatment of cancer. The Company provided Bristol-Myers Squibb access to a selected number of its existing screening campaigns and novel campaigns. The Company was responsible for carrying out early-stage research activities directed to identifying potential targets for potential licensing by Bristol-Myers Squibb, in accordance with a mutually agreed upon research plan, and was solely responsible for such costs. The collaboration consisted of programs directed to both druggable targets and to targets commonly considered undruggable to traditional small molecule approaches.

In June 2023, the Company and Ono determined not to further extend the term of the Ono Agreement. As a result, no product candidate would be licensed to Ono pursuant to the terms of the Ono Agreement. The Company recognized approximately million as revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with regards to the performance obligation under the Ono Agreement. The Company did t recognize any revenue pursuant to the Ono Agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 

 operating leases with required future minimum payments. The Company s leases generally do not include or purchase options. In August 2024, the Company entered into a lease renewal agreement for office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a term ending in , which will result in additional minimum lease payments of million . The Company evaluates its finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing their carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic life. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company determined the carrying value of the right-of-use asset related to the office and laboratory space in Montr al, Qu bec was no longer recoverable and wrote the balance down to its estimated fair value of nil. The resulting impairment loss of million is reflected within research and development expenses.

 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with (i) our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and (ii) the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Annual Report ), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (the SEC ), on February 28, 2024. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 Overview 
 We are a leading clinical-stage precision oncology company enabled by our proprietary synthetic lethality approach to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics. Synthetic lethality SL represents a clinically validated approach to drug development. We use our proprietary, genome-wide, CRISPR-enabled SNIPRx platform to systematically discover and develop highly targeted cancer therapies that preferentially treat cancers due to mechanisms of genomic instability, including DNA damage repair. SL arises when a deficiency in either of two genes is tolerated in cells, but simultaneous deficiencies in both genes cause cell death. Cancer cells that contain a mutation in one gene of a SL pair are susceptible to therapeutic intervention targeting the other gene pair. 
 Our Pipeline 
 Using our SNIPRx platform, we have internally developed four clinical therapeutic candidates: 
 
 1. Lunresertib (RP-6306) is a first-in-class, selective and potent oral small molecule inhibitor of PKMYT1 (Protein Kinase Membrane-associated tyrosine- and threonine- specific cdc-2 inhibitory kinase), a cancer target we discovered and identified as synthetic lethal with cyclin E1 CCNE1 amplification, or deleterious alterations in FBXW7 or PPP2R1A in solid tumors such as gynecological, colorectal and upper gastrointestinal malignancies. Lunresertib is currently the sole PKMYT1 inhibitor known to be in clinical trials and is being evaluated alone and in combinations across several clinical trials in the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and Canada. 

We presented positive initial Phase 1 data from our ongoing Phase 1 MYTHIC trial deamonstrating proof of concept for lunresertib alone and in combination with camonsertib at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (ANE) in October 2023. Lunresertib was shown to be well tolerated, with a compelling safety profile. We further presented positive updated safety and tolerability data for the combination of camonsertib and lunresertib at the FDA-agreed recommended Phase 2 dose highlighting the benefits of an individualized schedule for the management of anemia at the ANE conference in October 2024. We also presented data at the American Association of Cancer Research s (AACR) 15th Annual Ovarian Cancer Research Symposium in September 2024 demonstrating significant survival disparities, poor prognosis, and inherent chemotherapy resistance in patients harboring lunresertib- and 
 16 

camonsertib-sensitizing biomarkers. In December 2024, we expect to provide updated MYTHIC data from ovarian and endometrial cancer expansion cohorts in approximately 20-30 patients each with the lunresertib and camonsertib combination, and expect to begin a registrational trial in 2025. In the third quarter of 2023, we received Fast Track designation for lunresertib in combination with camonsertib for the treatment of adult patients with CCNE1 amplified, or FBXW7 or PPP2R1A mutated endometrial cancer. In June 2024, we were granted Fast-Track designation by the FDA for lunresertib in combination with camonsertib for the treatment of adult patients with CCNE1 amplified, or FBXW7 or PPP2R1A-mutated platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. In preparation for a potential registrational clinical trial start in 2025, we formed a collaboration with Foundation Medicine, Inc. in September 2024 to provide prospective genomic profiling to patients in the ongoing MYTHIC study of lunresertib alone or in combinations in genomically-defined patient populations. We are additionally exploring opportunities with Foundation Medicine to develop FoundationOne CDx, a tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling test, as a companion diagnostic for the lunresertib program. 
 We initiated additional Phase 1 combination clinical trials of lunresertib with gemcitabine (MAGNETIC) in December 2021 and with FOLFIRI (MINOTAUR) in August 2022. In May 2024, we announced preliminary safety data for MINOTAUR demonstrating no significant incremental toxicities for the lunresertib and FOLFIRI combination over FOLFIRI alone and an early signal with favorable tolerability in colorectal and other gastrointestinal tumors. We announced positive initial data from the ongoing Phase 1 MINOTAUR clinical trial at the European Society of Medical Oncology ESMO Gastrointestinal (GI) Cancers Congress in June 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we received Fast Track designation for lunresertib in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of adult patients with CCNE1 amplified, or FBXW7, or PPP2R1A mutated platinum resistant ovarian cancer. We are collaborating with the Canadian Cancer Trials Group in an ongoing basket Phase 2 Investigator Sponsored Clinical Trial IST that is enrolling patients with selected, advanced cancers receiving lunresertib as combination (NCT05605509). A sub-study to that protocol is also ongoing that is evaluating lunresertib in combination with gemcitabine in patients with CDK4/6 inhibitor treated ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (NCT05601440). We are also collaborating with University Health Network, Toronto on an investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial of lunresertib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in TP53 ovarian and uterine cancer (NCT06107868) and such trial is currently enrolling patients. 
 In January 2024, we announced our collaboration with Debiopharm International S.A., a Swiss-based biopharmaceutical company. As part of this collaboration, we are sponsoring a global trial as a new arm in the ongoing MYTHIC trial combining lunresertib with Debio 0123, a highly selective, brain penetrant, clinical WEE1 inhibitor. We announced the first patient was dosed with the synergistic lunresertib and Debio 0123 combination in April 2024. This is the first clinical trial inhibiting both PKMYT1 and WEE1. We expect to report initial data from this MYTHIC arm in 2025. 
 2. Camonsertib (RP-3500) is a potent and selective oral small molecule inhibitor of ATR (Ataxia-Telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein kinase) in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors with specific DNA damage repair-related genomic alterations, including those in the ATM gene (ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase). 

In June 2022, we entered into a worldwide license and collaboration agreement, or the Roche Agreement, with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (or Roche for the development and commercialization of camonsertib, which resulted in an initial 125 million upfront payment. In February 2024, we received a 40 million milestone payment from Roche upon dosing of the first patient with camonsertib in Roche s TAPISTRY trial. Over the course of the Roche camonsertib collaboration, we received a cumulative total of 182.6 million, including the upfront payment, the milestone payment, as well as additional reimbursements from Roche. On February 7, 2024, we received written notice from Roche of their election to terminate the Roche camonsertib collaboration. The termination became effective in May 2024, at which time we regained global development and commercialization rights for camonsertib from Roche. 
 In May 2024, we announced an expansion of the TRESR clinical trial as a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating camonsertib monotherapy in approximately 20 patients with ATM-mutated ATMm NSCLC, supported by early, promising camonsertib monotherapy signal in patients with ATMm NSCLC from the ongoing Phase 1/2 TRESR trial. We expect to report initial data from this expansion cohort TRESR trial in 2025. In September 2024, we presented Phase 1 data from a clinical trial conducted in collaboration with investigators at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center that demonstrated camonsertib in combination with palliative radiation demonstrated higher clinical benefit in patients with metastatic tumors harboring pathogenic ATM mutations versus those with variants of unknown significance. We presented initial clinical data from the Phase 1/2 TRESR and ATTACC clinical trials evaluating camonsertib in combination with three poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors - talazoparib, niraparib, and olaparib. Camonsertib demonstrated 48 overall CBR in patients with advanced solid tumors across tumor types regardless of choice of PARP inhibitor or platinum resistance, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

3. RP-1664 is a first-in-class, highly selective, oral PLK4 inhibitor designed to harness the synthetic lethal relationship with TRIM37 amplification or overexpression in solid tumors. Tumors rely on PLK4 for centriole biogenesis in S-phase of the cell cycle when TRIM37, an E3 ligase that reduces pericentriolar material, is high. Preclinical studies demonstrate that RP-1664 selectively inhibits PLK4 and drives potent synthetic lethality in TRIM37-high and other biomarkers tumor models, both in vitro and in vivo. Elevated TRIM37 is a feature found across a range of solid tumors and in approximately 80 of high-grade neuroblastoma. RP-1664 is the only selective PLK4 inhibitor known to be in the clinic. 

We reported comprehensive preclinical data for RP-1664 in November 2023, including deep tumor growth inhibition and regressions in multiple TRIM37-high solid tumor or neuroblastoma xenograft models. The preclinical in vivo animal model evaluations were performed both internally and in collaboration with Children s Hospital of Philadelphia. In February 2024, we dosed the first patient in the LIONS (PLK4 Inhibitor in Advanced Solid Tumors) clinical trial (NCT06232408), a multicenter, open-label Phase 1 clinical trial to investigate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and the preliminary efficacy of RP-1664. After evaluating safety in adult patients with recurrent solid tumors in the LIONS clinical trial, we expect to move into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with high risk, recurrent pediatric neuroblastoma, where the patients have limited treatment options and a high prevalence of TRIM37-altered tumors. 
 4. RP-3467 is a potential best-in-class inhibitor of adenosinetriphosphatase ATPase activity on the helicase domain of DNA polymerase theta Pol ). Pol is a synthetic lethal target associated with homologous recombination deficiency tumors, including those with BRCA1/2 mutations or other genomic alterations. Data suggest that RP-3467 works effectively and synergistically with therapies that result in double stranded DNA breaks, such as PARP inhibition, radioligand therapy and multiple chemotherapies and antibody-drug conjugates. Initial data suggest that Pol inhibition may interfere with mechanisms central to the development of PARPi resistance, which could be relevant to currently marketed PARP 1/2 inhibitors and the emerging PARP1-selective inhibitors. We also reported comprehensive preclinical data for RP-3467 in November 2023, in which RP-3467 demonstrated complete, sustained regressions in combination with PARP inhibitors and compelling anti-tumor activity in combination with RLT and chemotherapy. We dosed our first patient in the POLAR Phase 1 dose finding clinical trial (NCT06560632) of RP-3467 alone and in combination with the poly-ADP ribose PARP inhibitor, olaparib, in October 2024. 

Recent Developments 
 Lunresertib (RP-6306): First-in-class, oral PKMYT1 inhibitor 

o Currently evaluating lunresertib in combination with camonsertib in the MYTHIC dose expansion clinical trial at the RP2D in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian and endometrial cancers harboring CCNE1 amplification or FBXW7 or PPP2R1A mutations, which are predictive of poor prognosis. We are on track to report data from approximately 20-30 patients in each cohort in December 2024, with the plan to begin a registrational trial in 2025. 

o Presented positive updated safety and tolerability data from the Phase 1 MYTHIC trial at the RP2D highlighting the benefits of its individualized schedule for the management of anemia at the 36th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in October 2024. In this analysis, we followed patients for approximately nine months at the RP2D to assess the effectiveness of an individualized schedule. The analysis demonstrated a successful approach to mitigating mechanism-based anemia while maintaining clinical benefit. No thrombocytopenia of any grade nor serious neutropenia in these patients was observed. Dose optimization meaningfully reduced Grade 3 anemia to 22.6 from 51.4 in all patients. 

o Presented data at the American Association of Cancer Research s (AACR) 15th Annual Ovarian Cancer Research Symposium in September 2024 highlighting the impact of alterations in CCNE1 , FBXW7, and PPP2R1A in patients with metastatic ovarian and endometrial cancers based on an analysis in approximately 2,000 patients from Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network and Memorial Sloan Kettering s Metastatic Events and Tropisms. The data underscores inherent chemotherapy resistance and the lack of treatment options for metastatic gynecologic cancer patients with these biomarkers. 

o Evaluating lunresertib in combination with Debio 0123, a highly selective, brain-penetrant, clinical WEE1 inhibitor, in Module 4 of the ongoing MYTHIC clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring CCNE1 amplification or FBXW7 or PPP2R1A deleterious alterations. We expect to report initial data from Module 4 of the MYTHIC trial in 2025. 

Camonsertib (RP-3500): Potential best-in-class oral ATR inhibitor 

o Evaluating camonsertib as a monotherapy in the ongoing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expansion of the Phase 2 TRESR clinical trial. Camonsertib has demonstrated a promising signal of prolonged progression free survival in 

18 

patients with ataxia-telangiectasia ATM) -mutated NSCLC in the TRESR clinical trial. We expect to report initial data from the TRESR clinical trial in 2025. 

o Presented Phase 1 data from a clinical trial conducted in collaboration with investigators at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center highlighting camonsertib in combination with palliative radiation for the treatment of metastatic tumors harboring an ATM mutation at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) annual meeting in September 2024. The first-in-human data showed that the combination demonstrated higher clinical benefit in patients with tumors harboring pathogenic ATM mutations versus those with variants of unknown significance. 

RP-1664: First-in-class, oral, selective PLK4 inhibitor 

o Evaluating RP-1664 as a monotherapy in the Phase 1 LIONS clinical trial in adult and adolescent patients with TRIM37-high solid tumors, including the recent dosing of the first adolescent patient with neuroblastoma. After evaluating safety in the LIONS clinical trial, we expect to rapidly advance RP-1664 into a Phase 1/2 trial in pediatric patients with high risk, recurrent neuroblastoma, where the patients have a high prevalence of TRIM37-altered tumors. 

RP-3467: Potential best-in-class, oral Pol ATPase inhibitor 

o Dosed the first patient in the POLAR clinical trial evaluating RP-3467, a Pol ATPase inhibitor, alone and in combination with the poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, olaparib. The POLAR clinical trial is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of RP-3647 alone or in combination with olaparib in adults with molecularly selected advanced solid tumors. The trial is expected to enroll patients with locally advanced or metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 

Other Company Updates 

o In August 2024, we announced a strategic reprioritization of our research and development activities to focus our efforts on the advancement of our portfolio of clinical-stage oncology programs. As part of this strategic refocus, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 25 , with a majority of the headcount reductions from our preclinical group. 

Liquidity Overview 
 Since our inception in September 2016, we have focused primarily on raising capital, organizing and staffing our company, conducting discovery and research activities, identifying potential SL gene pairs, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio including for our proprietary SNIPRx platform, developing and progressing our product candidates through preclinical studies and preparing for clinical trials and establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of initial quantities of our product candidates and component materials. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand of 179.4 million. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2026. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were 93.8 million and 29.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 56.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 389.1 million. 
 We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development and seek regulatory approvals, manufacture drug product and drug supply, and maintain and expand our intellectual property portfolio. Our net losses are also expected to be impacted as we pay for accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and consulting services, and pay costs associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and SEC requirements, directors and officers, or D O, insurance, investor and public relations activities and other expenses associated with operating as a public company. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our preclinical studies, our clinical trials, our expenditures on other research and development activities, and our revenue and expenses recognized from collaboration and license agreements. 
 We do not have any products approved for sale. We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, if ever. As a result, we will need substantial 
 19 

additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity offerings and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Macroeconomic Considerations 
 Unfavorable conditions in the economy in the United States, Canada and abroad may negatively affect the growth of our business and our results of operations. For example, macroeconomic events, including health pandemics, changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, banking crises or disruptions in access to bank deposits or lending commitments, natural disasters, geopolitical instability resulting from war, terrorism and other violence, as well as supply chain disruptions have led to economic uncertainty globally and could impact our overall business operations. The effect of macroeconomic conditions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. If, however, economic uncertainty increases or the global economy worsens, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. 
 In addition, because some of our manufacturers and suppliers are located in China, we are exposed to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies, laws, rules and regulations of the United States or Chinese governments, as well as political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China. For example, trade tensions between the United States and China have been escalating in recent years. Most notably, several rounds of U.S. tariffs have been placed on Chinese goods being exported to the United States. Each of these U.S. tariff impositions against Chinese exports was followed by a round of retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports to China. Our components may in the future be subject to these tariffs, which could increase our manufacturing costs and could make our products, if successfully developed and approved, less competitive than those of our competitors whose inputs are not subject to these tariffs. We may otherwise experience supply disruptions or delays, and although we carefully manage our supply and lead-times, our suppliers may not continue to provide us with clinical supply in our required quantities, to our required specifications and quality levels or at attractive prices. In addition, certain Chinese biotechnology companies and CMOs may become subject to trade restrictions, sanctions, other regulatory requirements, or proposed legislation by the U.S. government, which could restrict or even prohibit our ability to work with such entities, thereby potentially disrupting the supply of material to us. Such disruption could have adverse effects on the development of our product candidates and our business operations. In addition, the proposed BIOSECURE Act recently passed in the House of Representatives, as well as a substantially similar bill in the Senate, prohibit U.S. federal government contracts, loans and grants to entities that use biotechnology equipment or services from designated "biotechnology companies of concern," which currently include a number of Chinese biotechnology companies. The current House version of the BIOSECURE Act provides a grandfathering provision allowing biotechnology equipment and services provided or produced by a biotechnology company of concern under a contract or agreement entered into before the effective date until January 1, 2032. Depending on whether the BIOSECURE Act becomes law, what the final language of the BIOSECURE Act includes, and how the law is interpreted by U.S. federal agencies, companies could lose the ability to contract with, or otherwise receive funding from, the U.S. government if they contract with or continue to use designated biotechnology companies of concern beyond the grandfathering period. 
 For further discussion of the potential impacts of macroeconomic events on our business, financial condition, and operating results, see the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 To date, we have not recognized any revenue from product sales, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. However, there can be no assurance as to when we will generate such revenue, if at all.

Collaboration and License Agreement with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
 On June 1, 2022, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Roche Agreement, with Roche regarding the development and commercialization of our product candidate camonsertib (also known as RP-3500) and specified other ATR inhibitors, which we refer to as the Licensed Products. 
 Under the Roche Agreement, we granted Roche a worldwide, perpetual, exclusive, sublicensable license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize the Licensed Products. Roche assumed all subsequent development of camonsertib with the potential to expand development into additional tumors and multiple combination studies. We agreed to complete specified ongoing clinical trials in accordance with the development plan in the Roche Agreement, as well as ongoing investigator sponsored trials, or together, the Continuing Trials, at our expense. We also retained the right to conduct specified clinical trials of camonsertib in combination with our PKMYT1 compound (also known as RP-6306). 
 In February 2024, we received a 40 million milestone payment from Roche that was earned upon dosing of the first patient with camonsertib in Roche s Phase 2 TAPISTRY trial in January 2024. 
 In March 2024, we received a further payment of 4.0 million for revisions to the clinical development plan under the Roche Agreement, of which 2.1 million was previously recorded as a receivable on our balance sheet at December 31, 2023.

 On February 7, 2024, we received written notice from Roche of their election to terminate the Roche Agreement following a review of Roche s pipeline and evolving external factors. The termination became effective May 7, 2024, at which time we regained global development and commercialization rights for camonsertib from Roche. 
 Collaboration and License Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company 
 In May 2020, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the BMS Agreement, with the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or Bristol-Myers Squibb, pursuant to which we and Bristol-Myers Squibb have agreed to collaborate in the research and development of potential new product candidates for the treatment of cancer. We provided Bristol-Myers Squibb access to a selected number of our existing screening campaigns and novel campaigns. We were responsible for carrying out early-stage research activities directed to identifying potential targets for potential licensing by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The collaboration consisted of programs directed to both druggable targets and to targets commonly considered undruggable to traditional small molecule approaches. In the event that Bristol-Myers Squibb elects to obtain an exclusive license for the subsequent development, manufacturing and commercialization of a program, Bristol-Myers Squibb will then be solely responsible for all such worldwide activities. 
 Although the collaboration term expired in November 2023, the BMS Agreement will not expire until, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, the expiration of the applicable royalty term and in its entirety upon expiration of the 
 21 

last royalty term. Either party may terminate earlier upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party, or the insolvency of the other party. Additionally, Bristol-Myers Squibb may terminate the BMS Agreement for any or no reason on a program-by-program basis upon specified written notice. We are eligible to receive up to 301.0 million in total milestones on a program-by-program basis, subject upon the achievement of certain specified research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We are further entitled to a tiered percentage royalty on annual net sales ranging from high-single digits to low-double digits, subject to certain specified reductions. 
 In March 2024, Bristol-Myers Squibb exercised its one remaining option for an undruggable target for a combined total of five druggable targets and one undruggable target over the course of the collaboration. As a result, we recognized the remaining deferred revenue of 2.6 million as revenue related to undruggable targets, including an option fee payment of 0.1 million. 
 Ono Collaboration Agreement 
 In January 2019, we entered into a research services, license and collaboration agreement, or the Ono Agreement, with Ono Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., or Ono, pursuant to which we and Ono agreed to collaborate in the research of potential product candidates targeting Pol and the development of our small molecule Pol inhibitor program. In June 2023, we and Ono determined not to further extend the Term of the Ono Agreement. As a result, no product candidate would be licensed to Ono pursuant to the terms of the Ono Agreement. We recognized approximately 10.5 million as revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 with regards to the performance obligation under the Ono Agreement. We did not recognize any revenue pursuant to the Ono Agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Debiopharm Collaborative Arrangement 
 In January 2024, we entered into a clinical study and collaboration agreement, or the Debio Collaboration Agreement, with Debiopharm International S.A., or Debiopharm, a privately-owned, Swiss-based biopharmaceutical company, with the aim to explore the synergy between our compound, lunresertib, and Debiopharm s compound, Debio 0123, a WEE1 inhibitor. We are collaborating with Debiopharm on the development of a combination therapy, with us sponsoring the global study, and will share all costs equally. Both parties are each supplying their respective drugs and retain all commercial rights to their respective compounds, including as monotherapy or as combination therapies. The activities associated with the Debio Collaboration Agreement are coordinated by a joint steering committee, which is comprised of an equal number of representatives from both parties. 
 Based on the terms of the Debio Collaboration Agreement, we concluded that the Debio Collaboration Agreement meets the requirements of a collaboration within the guidance of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements , as both parties are active participants in the combination trial and are exposed to significant risks and rewards depending on the success of the combination trial. Accordingly, the net costs associated with the co-development are expensed as incurred and recognized within research and development expenses in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 0.8 million and 2.1 million, respectively, in net research and development costs with regards to the Debiopharm portion of the 50/50 cost sharing terms in the Debio Collaboration Agreement, and recorded a receivable from Debiopharm of 0.3 million as of September 30, 2024 in other current receivables . 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, partially offset by development cost reimbursements from collaborative arrangements and fully refundable Canadian research and development tax credits. We expense research and development costs as incurred, which include: 
 external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other scientific development services; 

employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation, and other related costs for those employees involved in research and development efforts; 

costs related to manufacturing material for our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs; 

laboratory supplies and research materials; 

22 

upfront, milestone and maintenance fees incurred under license, acquisition and other third-party agreements; 

costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and 

facilities, depreciation, scientific advisory board and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, maintenance of facilities and equipment, insurance, equipment and software. 

Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as information provided to us by our vendors and analyzing the progress of our studies or other services performed. Significant judgment and estimates are made in determining the accrued expense or prepaid balances at the end of any reporting period. 
 We characterize research and development costs incurred prior to the identification of a product candidate as discovery costs. We characterize costs incurred once a product candidate has been identified as development costs. 
 Our direct external research and development expenses consist primarily of fees paid to outside consultants, CROs, CMOs and research laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Our direct external research and development expenses also include fees incurred under license, acquisition, and option agreements. We track these external research and development costs on a program-by-program basis once we have identified a product candidate. 
 We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to conduct our research and discovery activities as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing, and clinical development activities.

The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. While in the short term we expect our research and development expenses to decrease as a result of the cost savings initiatives we implemented in connection with a strategic reprioritization in August 2024, we plan to substantially increase our research and development expenses in the longer term as we continue the development of our product candidates, including the potential registrational trial of lunresertib and camonsertib combination expected to commence in 2025. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration, or the completion costs of current or future preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments, and our ongoing assessments as to each product candidate s commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. Our clinical development costs are expected to increase significantly as we commence clinical trials. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially, particularly due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including the uncertainty of: 
 the scope, rate of progress, and expenses of our ongoing research activities as well as any preclinical studies, clinical trials and other research and development activities; 

establishing an appropriate safety profile; 

successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials; 

whether our product candidates show safety and efficacy in our clinical trials; 

receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; 

obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; 

commercializing product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and 

continued acceptable safety profile of products following any regulatory approval. 

Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on other product candidates. For example, if the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, (EMA), or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our ongoing and planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation and other related costs, as well as expenses for outside professional services, including legal, accounting and audit services and other consulting fees, rent expense, directors and officers insurance expenses, investor and public relations expenses and other general administrative expenses. 
 We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and directors and officers insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses. 
 Restructuring Expenses 
 In August 2024, we announced a strategic reprioritization of our research and development activities to focus our efforts on the advancement of our portfolio of clinical-stage oncology programs. As part of this strategic refocus, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 25 , with a majority of the headcount reductions from our preclinical group. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred approximately 1.5 million in costs as part of this strategic refocus, comprised primarily of severance and termination benefits. 
 24 

Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange, interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and other expenses such as interest and bank charges. 
 Realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses from holding cash and foreign currency denominated other receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities as well as operating lease liabilities.

Revenue 
 Revenue was nil for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 2.2 million was due to: 
 a 1.7 million decrease in revenue recognized under the Roche Agreement which was terminated in May 2024; and 

a 0.5 million decrease in revenue recognized under the BMS Agreement which expired in November 2023. 

Research and Development Expenses, Net of Tax Credits 
 Research and development expenses were 28.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 32.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 4.3 million was due to: 
 a 2.2 million decrease in direct external costs of the camonsertib program as a result of the Phase 1/2 TRESR and ATTACC clinical trials which are fully enrolled and expected to be completed in 2024; 

a 1.0 million decrease in direct external costs of the lunresertib program as a result of the Phase 1 Magnetic and Minotaur clinical trials which are fully enrolled; 

a 0.9 million decrease in other direct external costs related to discovery programs and other R D costs; 

a 0.8 million increase in the Debiopharm development cost reimbursement; and 

a 0.5 million decrease in personnel-related costs, including a 0.1 million decrease in share-based compensation; 

partially offset by a 1.1 million increase in the RP-1664 program as a result of the LIONS clinical trial underway. 

25 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.5 million in general and administrative expenses consisted of: 
 a 1.3 million decrease in personnel-related costs, including a 1.0 million decrease in share-based compensation; and 

a 0.2 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses. 

Restructuring Expenses 
 Restructuring expenses were 1.5 million and nil for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of costs incurred as part of our strategic refocus, comprised primarily of severance and termination benefits. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income, net was 2.5 million and 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.7 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
 Income Tax 
 Income tax expense was 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax recovery of 16.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 16.8 million in income tax recovery was primarily due to the issuance of IRC Section 174 guidance on September 8, 2023.

Research and Development Expenses, Net of Tax Credits 
 Research and development expenses were 91.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 98.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 6.9 million was due to: 
 a 5.9 million decrease in direct external costs of the camonsertib program for the Phase 1/2 TRESR and ATTACC clinical trials that are fully enrolled and expected to be completed in 2024; 

a 2.1 million increase in the Debiopharm development cost reimbursement; 

a 1.3 million decrease in other direct external costs related to discovery programs; and 

a 0.7 million decrease in the RP-3467 Pol program; 

partially offset by a 1.3 million increase in personnel-related costs, including a 0.5 million increase in share-based compensation; 

a 0.8 million increase in the RP-1664 program as a result of the LIONS clinical trial underway; 

a 0.6 million increase in direct external costs with the advancement of clinical trials for lunresertib; and 

a 0.4 million increase in other research and material expense including IT related costs. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.7 million in general and administrative expenses consisted of: 
 a 1.2 million decrease in our D O insurance premium; 

a 0.8 million decrease in personnel related costs, including a 0.9 million decrease in share-based compensation; and 

a 0.2 million increase in other general and administrative expenses consisting mostly of costs related to IT and professional fees. 

Restructuring Expenses 
 Restructuring expenses were 1.5 million and nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of costs incurred as part of our strategic refocus, comprised primarily of severance and termination benefits. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income, net was 8.3 million and 10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 1.7 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
 Income Tax 
 Income tax expense was 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax recovery of 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 11.0 million in income tax recovery was primarily due to the issuance of IRC Section 174 guidance on September 8, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have not recognized any revenue from product sales and have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any product and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all. 
 In June 2020, we completed our IPO whereby we raised 232.0 million, net of underwriting commissions and offering expenses. In November 2021, we completed a follow-on offering whereby we raised 94.3 million, net of underwriting commissions and offering expenses. Prior to our IPO, we had funded our operations primarily through equity financings, having raised an aggregate of approximately 135.2 million of gross proceeds from the sale of our preferred shares and 15.0 million of gross proceeds from the issuance of a warrant to acquire our common shares. We have also received initial upfront and additional payments of approximately 60.5 million in the aggregate from partnerships with Ono for our Pol ATPase inhibitor program and Bristol-Myers Squibb for research 
 27 

and development of potential new product candidates for the treatment of cancer. In June 2022, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Roche for camonsertib and received a total of 182.6 million under the terms of the Roche Agreement, including an upfront payment of 125.0 million, a milestone payment of 40 million and additional reimbursements from Roche. 
 In November 2024, we entered into a Common Shares Sale Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with TD Securities (USA) LLC, or TD Cowen. Under the Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time at prevailing market prices, common shares, or the ATM Shares,. The ATM Shares to be sold under the Sales Agreement, if any, will be issued and sold pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-281298), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on August 19, 2024, up to a maximum aggregate amount of 100.0 million. We will file a prospectus supplement with the SEC on November 7, 2024 in connection with the offer and sale of the ATM Shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement. In connection with the Sales Agreement, we and TD Cowen terminated our prior sales agreement dated August 4, 2022. No shares were issued under this prior sales agreement. 
 In August 2024, we announced a strategic reprioritization of our research and development activities to focus our efforts on the advancement of our portfolio of clinical-stage oncology programs. As part of this strategic refocus, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 25 , with a majority of the headcount reductions from our preclinical group. We incurred approximately 1.5 million in costs as part of this strategic refocus, comprised primarily of severance and termination benefits. 
 We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval and pursue commercialization of any approved product candidates and we will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will increase in connection with our planned research and development activities. 
 Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct certain U.S.-based research and development expenditures in the current fiscal year and required taxpayers to amortize them over five years pursuant to Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC. This provision increased our 2023 and 2022 cash payments of income taxes significantly as compared to 2021 in compliance with IRC Section 174. In September 2023, new interim guidance was issued by the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service on IRC Section 174 that supports the deduction of such expenses. An income tax receivable in the amount of 11.6 million as of September 30, 2024 reflects the overpayment of tax installments by our U.S. subsidiary (net of a 4.8 million refund received in October 2023). Any changes to tax legislation may materially affect our cash flows. Changes in our tax provisions or an increase in our tax liabilities, whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or our interpretation or application thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand was 179.4 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2026. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development, and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the initiation, timing, costs, progress and results of our product candidates, including our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials of lunresertib, camonsertib and RP-1664; 

the progress of preclinical development and possible clinical trials of our current earlier-stage programs; 

the scope, progress, results and costs of our research programs and preclinical development of any additional product candidates that we may pursue; 

the development requirements of other product candidates that we may pursue; 

our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development and establish a commercial infrastructure; 

the timing and amount of milestone and royalty payments that we are required to make or eligible to receive under our current or future collaboration agreements; 

28 

the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities; 

the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive marketing approval; 

the cost of expanding, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio, including filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 

the cost of defending potential intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us or any of our product candidates; 

the effect of competing technological and market developments; 

the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale manufacturing activities; 

the extent to which we partner our programs, acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies or enter into additional strategic collaborations; 

the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of lunresertib, camonsertib and any future product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive marketing approval; and 

the costs of operating as a public company. 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues to support our cost structure, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and other similar arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common shareholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common shares. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 49.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a net loss of 56.0 million, a net change of 10.3 million in our net operating assets, offset by non-cash charges of 17.2 million. The non-cash charges primarily consist of share-based compensation for option and restricted share unit grants to employees, as well as depreciation expense, and non-cash lease expense offset by the net accretion of marketable securities. The change in our net operating assets was due to decreases of 12.0 million in deferred revenue and 1.7 million in total operating lease liability, as well as increases of 2.0 million in prepaid expenses, with the payment of D O insurance during the quarter, offset by increases of 2.4 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and 1.5 million in income taxes payable and a decrease of 1.5 million in other current receivables and other non-current assets. 
 29 

Net cash used in operating activities was 99.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a net loss of 65.8 million and a net change of 49.2 million in our net operating assets, offset by non-cash charges of 16.0 million. The non-cash charges primarily consist of share-based compensation for option and restricted share unit grants to employees, as well as depreciation expense, and non-cash lease expense, offset by the net accretion of marketable securities. The change in our net operating assets was primarily due to a decrease of 32.8 million in deferred revenue recognized, a 19.3 million tax recovery and a 1.6 million decrease in operating lease liability, offset by an increase of 4.6 million in accounts payable. 
 The 49.9 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to the 40.0 million milestone payment from Roche in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and resulted primarily from proceeds on maturities of marketable securities offset by the purchases of marketable securities. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 46.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and resulted primarily from proceeds on maturities of marketable securities offset by the purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 0.5 million and 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisting primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of common shares under the ESPP. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 In August 2024, the Company entered into a lease renewal agreement for office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a twelve-month term ending in January 2026, which will result in additional minimum lease payments of 1.1 million over the twelve-month extended lease term. 
 Other than the changes in our lease commitments described above, there were no material changes to our material cash requirements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Annual Report. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 This management s discussion and analysis is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reported periods. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates. 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates from those described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Annual Report. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a description of recent issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to certain risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 30 

Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we earned 8.4 million in interest income from cash balances held in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of September 30, 2024, we have a balance of 179.4 million in cash, money market funds, commercial paper and corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits investment instruments to investment-grade securities with the objective to preserve capital and to maintain liquidity until the funds can be used in business operations. We do not have in place any tools to manage our interest rate risk. The risk of a sudden, significant change in market interest rates relative to the interest rates earned on our bank accounts and marketable securities having an impact on our results of operations or cash flows is limited owing to the relative short-term nature of these investments. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Our reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollar at exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date. Income items and expenses are translated using average exchange rate in effect for the relevant period. 
 We incur a portion of our expenses in Canadian dollars, as well as other currencies to a lesser extent. A change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar and other currencies may negatively affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions to date, although we may choose to do so in the future. We do, however, keep expected Canadian dollar cash requirements in Canadian dollars to form a natural hedge. We are exposed to currency risk through our cash, other current receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities denominated in Canadian dollars. Based on our Canadian dollar net exposure as of September 30, 2024, and assuming all other variables remain constant, a 10 depreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar would result in a decrease of approximately 0.1 million in our net loss. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. Similarly, an evaluation of controls cannot provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 Investing in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risks described in the Annual Report, including the disclosure therein under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors, before deciding whether to invest in our common shares. These are not the only risks facing our business. Other risks and uncertainties that we are not currently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and future results. Risks we have identified but currently consider immaterial could still also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and future results of operations if our assumptions about those risks are incorrect or if circumstances change. 
 There were no material changes during the period covered in this Quarterly Report to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report, except as follows: 
 We are a smaller reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common shares less attractive to investors. 
 Because the market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates was less than 200 million as of June 30, 2024, we qualify as a smaller reporting company under the Exchange Act as of June 30, 2024. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. As a smaller reporting company, we may rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. For so long as we remain a smaller reporting company, we are permitted and intend to rely on such exemptions from certain disclosure and other requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies. 
 We cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive because we may rely on the exemptions and reduced disclosure obligations applicable to smaller reporting companies. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile. 
 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, shareholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common shares. 
 We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as amended and the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Global Market. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are now required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow our management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, at such time we no longer qualify as a "smaller reporting company", our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to issue an annual report that attests the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Further, we may in the future discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Moreover, our internal controls over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. 
 32 

If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, the market price of our common shares could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The Nasdaq Global Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 
 Our strategic reprioritization and the associated workforce reduction announced in August 2024 may not result in anticipated cost savings, could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected and could disrupt our business. 
 In August 2024, along with our strategic reprioritization, we announced a reduction in workforce by approximately 25 in connection with the strategic reprioritization of our research and development activities to focus our efforts on the advancement of our portfolio of clinical-stage oncology programs. The reduction in force was a component of our broader efforts to materially reduce our research and development expenses by streamlining our operations to focus on the advancement of our lunresertib, camonsertib, RP-1664 and RP-3467 programs while materially reducing the scale of our preclinical research and discovery activities. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our operating structure from our restructuring and reprioritization efforts. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings, our results of operation and financial condition would be adversely affected. We cannot guarantee that we will not have to undertake additional workforce reductions or restructuring activities in the future. Furthermore, our strategic restructuring plan may be disruptive to our operations. For example, our workforce reductions could yield unanticipated consequences, such as attrition beyond planned staff reductions, increased difficulties in our day-to-day operations and reduced employee morale. If employees who were not affected by the reduction in force seek alternate employment, this could result in us seeking contract support at unplanned additional expense or harm our productivity. Our workforce reductions could also harm our ability to attract and retain qualified management, scientific, clinical, and manufacturing personnel who are critical to our business. Any failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could prevent us from successfully developing lunresertib, camonsertib, RP-1664, RP-3467 and other product candidates in the future. 
 Enacted and future healthcare legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to progress our clinical programs and obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and may affect the prices we may set. 
 In the United States and other jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA, among other things, increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts (increased to 70 percent, effective as of January 1, 2019) off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain branded prescription drugs to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 There have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress. Moreover, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the donut-hole under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and through a newly established manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is also unclear how any such challenges and other litigation, and further healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will remain in 
 33 

effect until 2032 unless additional action is taken by Congress. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100 of a drug s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws or any other similar laws introduced in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could negatively affect our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. 
 Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, Promoting Competition in the American Economy, with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. HHS has and will continue to issue and update guidance as these programs are implemented. These provisions began to take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023. On August 15, 2024, HHS announced the agreed-upon reimbursement price for the first ten drugs that were subject to price negotiations, although the Medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges. HHS will select up to fifteen additional drugs covered under Part D for negotiation in 2025. Further, in response to the Biden administration's October 2022 executive order, on February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the CMS Innovation Center which will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve quality of care. Further, on December 7, 2023, the Biden administration announced an initiative to control the price of prescription drugs through the use of march-in rights under the Bayh-Dole Act. On December 8, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published for comment a Draft Interagency Guidance Framework for Considering the Exercise of March-In Rights which for the first time includes the price of a product as one factor an agency can use when deciding to exercise march-in rights. While march-in rights have not previously been exercised, it is uncertain if that will continue under the new framework. It is unclear whether the models will be utilized in any health reform measures in the future. We expect additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the upcoming U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.

 Sales Agreement 
 On November 7, 2024, we entered into a Common Shares Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with TD Securities (USA) LLC, or TD Cowen, as sales agent, pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, common shares, or the ATM Shares. The ATM Shares to be sold under the Sales Agreement, if any, will be issued and sold pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-281298), which was declared effective by the SEC on August 19, 2024, up to a maximum aggregate amount of 100.0 million. We will file a prospectus supplement with the SEC on November 7, 2024 in connection with the offer and sale of the ATM Shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement. 
 We are not obligated to sell any ATM Shares under the Sales Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, TD Cowen will use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable laws and regulations to sell ATM Shares from time to time based upon our instructions, including any price, time or size limits specified by us, subject to certain limitations. Under the Sales Agreement, TD Cowen may sell ATM Shares by any method permitted by law deemed to be an "at the market offering" as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act, including block transactions, sales made directly on the Nasdaq Global Market or sales made into any other existing trading market of our common shares. 
 We will pay TD Cowen a commission of up to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from each sale of ATM Shares, reimburse legal fees and disbursements and provide TD Cowen with customary indemnification and contribution rights. The Sales Agreement will terminate as set forth in the Sales Agreement. The foregoing description of the Sales Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Sales Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and incorporated herein by reference. In connection with the Sales Agreement, we and TD Cower terminated our prior Common Shares Sales Agreement dated August 4, 2022. 
 Stikeman Elliott LLP, our Canadian counsel, has issued a legal opinion relating to the validity of the ATM Shares being offered pursuant to the Sales Agreement. A copy of such legal opinion, including the consent included therein, is filed as Exhibit 5.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any ATM Shares under the Sales Agreement nor shall there be any sale of such ATM Shares in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.

The Company will conduct its affairs in such a manner so as to reasonably ensure that neither it nor its subsidiaries will be or become, at any time prior to the termination of this Agreement, an investment company, as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act, assuming no change in the Commission s current interpretation as to entities that are not considered an investment company.

 (iii) All sums payable to TD Cowen shall be considered exclusive of any value added or similar taxes. Where the Company is obliged to pay value added or similar tax on any amount payable hereunder to TD Cowen, the Company shall in addition to the sum payable hereunder pay an amount equal to any applicable value added or similar tax.

(a) 	 Registration Statement Effective . The Registration Statement shall be effective and shall be available for the sale of all Placement Shares contemplated to be issued pursuant to any Placement Notice.

22 

Registration Statement, related Prospectus or such documents so that, in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any materially untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and, that in the case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any materially untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(e) 	 Company Counsel Legal Opinions . TD Cowen shall have received the opinions and negative assurance letters of Company Counsel required to be delivered pursuant to Section 7(n) on or before the date on which such delivery of such opinion is required pursuant to Section 7(n) .

24 

liabilities, expenses or damages arise out of or are based, directly or indirectly, on (x) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any free writing prospectus or (y) the omission or alleged omission to state in any such document a material fact required to be stated in it or necessary to make the statements in it not misleading; provided , however , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to the extent that such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage arises from the sale of the Placement Shares pursuant to this Agreement and is caused directly or indirectly by an untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with solely Agent s Information. Agent s Information means, solely, the following information in the Prospectus: the second (2nd) sentence of the seventh (7th) paragraph under the caption Plan of Distribution in the Prospectus. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company might otherwise have. 

(b) 	 TD Cowen Indemnification . TD Cowen agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors and each officer of the Company that signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who (i) controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or (ii) is controlled by or is under common control with the Company against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in Section 9(a) , as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendments thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with the Agent s Information. 

(c) 	 Procedure . Any party that proposes to assert the right to be indemnified under this Section 9 will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party or parties under this Section 9 , notify each such indemnifying party of the commencement of such action, enclosing a copy of all papers served, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from (i) any liability that it might have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 9 and (ii) any liability that it may have to any indemnified party under the foregoing provision of this Section 9 unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses by the indemnifying party. If any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of its commencement, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it elects by delivering written notice to the indemnified party promptly after receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the indemnified party, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of the action, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses except as provided below and except for the reasonable and documented costs of investigation subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense. The indemnified party will have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the reasonable and documented fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (1) the employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (2) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying 

25 

party, (3) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (4) the indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable and documented fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties. It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time for all such indemnified party or parties. All such fees, disbursements and other charges will be reimbursed by the indemnifying party promptly as they are incurred. An indemnifying party will not, in any event, be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding relating to the matters contemplated by this Section 9 (whether or not any indemnified party is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim, action or proceeding. 

(d) 	 Contribution . In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in the foregoing paragraphs of this Section 9 is applicable in accordance with its terms but for any reason is held to be unavailable from the Company or TD Cowen, the Company and TD Cowen will contribute to the total losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages (including any investigative, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim asserted, but after deducting any contribution received by the Company from persons other than TD Cowen, such as persons who control the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company, who also may be liable for contribution) to which the Company and TD Cowen may be subject in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and TD Cowen on the other. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and TD Cowen on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total Net Proceeds from the sale of the Placement Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total compensation received by TD Cowen from the sale of Placement Shares on behalf of the Company. If, but only if, the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the allocation of contribution shall be made in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in the foregoing sentence but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and TD Cowen, on the other, with respect to the statements or omission that resulted in such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations with respect to such offering. Such relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or TD Cowen, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and TD Cowen agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 

26 

9(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, liability, expense, or damage, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include, for the purpose of this Section 9(d) , any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim to the extent consistent with Section 9(c) hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(d) , TD Cowen shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the commissions received by it under this Agreement and no person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9(d) , any person who controls a party to this Agreement within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any officers, directors, partners, employees or agents of TD Cowen, will have the same rights to contribution as that party, and each director of the Company and each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement will have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the provisions hereof. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made under this Section 9(d) , will notify any such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify will not relieve that party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have under this Section 9(d) except to the extent that the failure to so notify such other party materially prejudiced the substantive rights or defenses of the party from whom contribution is sought. Except for a settlement entered into pursuant to the last sentence of Section 9(c) hereof, no party will be liable for contribution with respect to any action or claim settled without its written consent if such consent is required pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof. 

10. Representations and Agreements to Survive Delivery . The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in Section 9 of this Agreement and all representations and warranties of the Company herein or in certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall survive, as of their respective dates, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of TD Cowen, any controlling persons, or the Company (or any of their respective officers, directors or controlling persons), (ii) delivery and acceptance of the Placement Shares and payment therefor or (iii) any termination of this Agreement. 

11. Termination. 

(a) 	TD Cowen shall have the right by giving notice as hereinafter specified at any time to terminate this Agreement if (i) any Material Adverse Change, or any development that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change has occurred that, in the reasonable judgment of TD Cowen, may materially impair the ability of TD Cowen to sell the Placement Shares hereunder, (ii) the Company shall have failed, refused or been unable to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, (iii) any other condition of TD Cowen s obligations hereunder is not fulfilled, or (iv) any suspension or limitation of trading in the Placement Shares or in securities generally on Nasdaq shall have occurred. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 7(g) (Expenses), Section 9 (Indemnification and Contribution), Section 10 (Representations and Agreements to Survive Delivery), Section 16 (Applicable Law; Consent to Jurisdiction) and 

27 

Section 18 (Waiver of Jury Trial) hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding such termination. If TD Cowen elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section 11(a) , TD Cowen shall provide the required notice as specified in Section 12 (Notices). 

(b) 	The Company shall have the right, by giving five (5) days notice as hereinafter specified to terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion at any time after the date of this Agreement. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 7(g) , Section 9 , Section 10 , Section 16 and Section 18 hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding such termination. 

(c) 	TD Cowen shall have the right, by giving five (5) days notice as hereinafter specified to terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion at any time after the date of this Agreement. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 7(g) , Section 9 , Section 10 , Section 16 and Section 18 hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding such termination. 

(d) 	Unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section 11 , this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the issuance and sale of all of the Placement Shares through TD Cowen on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; provided that the provisions of Section 7(g) , Section 9 , Section 10 , Section 16 and Section 18 hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding such termination. 

(e) 	This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect unless terminated pursuant to Sections 11(a) , (b) , (c), or (d) above or otherwise by mutual agreement of the parties; provided, however, that any such termination by mutual agreement shall in all cases be deemed to provide that Section 7(g) , Section 9 , Section 10 , Section 16 and Section 18 shall remain in full force and effect. 

(f) 	Any termination of this Agreement shall be effective on the date specified in such notice of termination; provided, however, that such termination shall not be effective until the close of business on the date of receipt of such notice by TD Cowen or the Company, as the case may be. If such termination shall occur prior to the Settlement Date for any sale of Placement Shares, such Placement Shares shall settle in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 

12. Notices . All notices or other communications required or permitted to be given by any party to any other party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, and if sent to TD Cowen, shall be delivered to TD Cowen at TD Securities (USA) LLC, 1 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, New York 10017, Attention: General Counsel, email: CIBLegal@tdsecurities.com, with a copy to Paul Hastings LLP, The MetLife Building, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166, Attention: Siavosh Salimi and William A.

References to any of the parties contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the successors and permitted assigns of such party. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. Neither party may assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party; provided , however , that TD Cowen may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to an affiliate of TD Cowen without obtaining the Company s consent.

Neither this Agreement nor any term hereof may be amended except pursuant to a written instrument executed by the Company and TD Cowen. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable as written by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such provision shall be given full force and effect to the fullest possible extent that it is valid, legal and enforceable, and the remainder of the terms and provisions herein shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision was not contained herein, but only to the extent that giving effect to such provision and the remainder of the terms and provisions hereof shall be in accordance with the intent of the parties as reflected in this Agreement. 

16. Applicable Law; Consent to Jurisdiction . This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York, borough of Manhattan, for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection with any transaction contemplated hereby, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof (certified or registered mail, return receipt requested) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any 

29 

way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law. To the extent that the Company has or hereafter may acquire any immunity (on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise) from the jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process with respect to itself or its property, the Company irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such immunity in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding.

The Company represents and warrants that such agent has agreed to act as the Company s agent for service of process, and the Company agrees to take any and all action, including the filing of any and all documents and instruments, that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect. 

17. Judgment Currency . If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder into any currency other than United States dollars, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures TD Cowen could purchase United States dollars with such other currency in The City of New York on the business day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Company with respect to any sum due from it to TD Cowen or any person controlling TD Cowen shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than United States dollars, not be discharged until the first business day following receipt by TD Cowen or such controlling person of any sum in such other currency, and only to the extent that TD Cowen or such controlling person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase United States dollars with such other currency.
