 and discontinued its AUR300 research and development program. For further discussion, refer to Note 19, Restructuring. 
 On November 7, 2024, Aurinia announced it was implementing a strategic restructuring to sharpen the Company's focus on continued LUPKYNIS growth and the rapid development of AUR200. This restructuring will result in a workforce reduction of approximately and Aurinia anticipates a one-time restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2024 of approximately to million and will focus the Company s LUPKYNIS commercial strategy on the highest growth drivers. 
 The Company is also developing its pipeline asset AUR200, a differentiated, potential next generation therapy for autoimmune diseases that targets both BAFF (B-cell Activating Factor) and APRIL (A Proliferation-Inducing Ligand). On September 5, 2024, the Company announced the first participant has been dosed in a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) study of AUR200. The SAD study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and changes in biomarkers for AUR200 in healthy volunteers, with data expected in the first half of 2025. 
 Aurinia's head office and registered office is located at #140, 14315-118 Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T5L 4S6. Aurinia also has a United States commercial office located at 77 Upper Rock Circle Suite 700, Rockville, Maryland, 20850. 
 Aurinia is incorporated pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). The Company s common shares are traded on the Nasdaq Global Market (Nasdaq) under the symbol AUPH.

main specialty pharmacies for U.S. commercial sales of LUPKYNIS and a collaboration partnership with Otsuka for sales of semi-finished product and royalty, collaboration, and manufacturing services revenue in the Otsuka Territories. Revenues from our two main customers represented approximately and of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenues from our two main customers represented approximately and of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 In late March 2022, the Company provided a nominal additional discount to both of its two main U.S. specialty pharmacies, applicable for the 2022 calendar year, in connection with holding additional amounts of LUPKYNIS on hand for risk mitigation and supply chain concerns. In December 2022, the Company extended the nominal discount to the end of 2024. Such discounts, or any future discounts, may result in reduced sales to these customers in subsequent periods and substantial fluctuations in revenues from period to period. The Company monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. The Company regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances. Global economic conditions and customer specific factors may require the Company to periodically reevaluate the collectability of its receivables and based on this evaluation the Company could potentially incur credit losses. The Company has had no historical write-offs related to customers or receivables.

million and million, respectively. The Company's standard credit terms range from to days. The Company does not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between the transfer of the promised good to the customer and receipt of payment will be one year or less. The Company estimates the allowances using the current expected credit loss, or CECL, model. Under the CECL model, the allowances reflect the net amount expected to be collected from the accounts receivable. Aurinia evaluates the collectability of these cash flows based on the asset s amortized cost, the risk of loss even when that risk is remote, losses over an asset s contractual life, and other relevant information available to the Company. Accounts receivable balances are written off against the allowance when it is probable that the receivable will not be collected. Given the nature of the Company's accounts receivable, it determined that an allowance for current expected credit losses was as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 The Company's Level 1 instruments include cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash that are valued using quoted market prices. Aurinia estimates the fair values of investments in corporate debt securities, government and government related securities and certificates of deposits by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. The fair value of the Company's investments classified within Level 2 is based upon observable inputs that may include benchmark yield curves, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities and reference data including market research publications. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average remaining contractual maturities of Aurinia's Level 2 investments were approximately months for both periods. The Company's policy is for these investments to have an overall rating of A-1, or higher, by Standard Poor's, or an equivalent rating by Moody s or Fitch. 
 No credit loss allowance was recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as the Company does not believe the unrealized loss is a result of a credit loss due to the nature of the investments. Aurinia also considered the current and expected future economic and market conditions and determined that the estimate of credit losses was not significantly impacted. 
 Refer to Note 4, Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Investments , for the carrying amount and related unrealized gains (losses) by type of investment.

 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, accrued interest receivable from investments was million and million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had million and million of unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, respectively, which are included as a component of comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had million and million of unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, respectively, which are included as a component of comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. Currently, the Company does not intend to sell investments that are in an unrealized loss position, and it is unlikely the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. The Company has determined that the gross unrealized gains on investments at September 30, 2024, were temporary in nature. Realized gains or losses were immaterial during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a right-of-use asset of million and lease liability of million included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded leasehold improvement incentives in the amount of million as additions to the lease liability. 
 When measuring the lease liability, the Company discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date on March 12, 2020. The incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liability was based on the financial position of the Company, geographical region and term of lease. 
 Edmonton, Alberta 
 During October 2022, the Company entered into a long term lease in Edmonton for a total of square feet of office space.

As the monoplant finance lease is denominated in Swiss francs, the company incurs unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses each reporting period related to the valuation of the lease liability and timing of lease payments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the ROU asset, net and corresponding lease liability balance were million and million, respectively.

These obligations were also contingent on the occurrence of uncertain future events. One of the former officers, Dr. Robert T.

 million in 2020 for the license agreement and has received million in regulatory and pricing approval related milestones. The Company provides semi-finished product of LUPKYNIS to Otsuka on a cost-plus basis, sharing capacity of the monoplant and receives tiered royalties ranging from to percent (dependent on territory and achievement of sale thresholds) on net product sales by Otsuka, along with 
 14

 million common shares of the Company, affirming its confidence in the Company's growth prospects. 
 
 On February 29, 2024, Canadian securities regulators granted exemptive relief for the Company s share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to percent of its issued and outstanding shares in any period for up to months, including under the current program. This program may be implemented through open market or privately negotiated purchases, including under a plan intended to comply with the affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1, Rule 10b-18 or an automatic securities purchase plan, an accelerated share repurchase program, or other mechanisms. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price, legal requirements, including applicable blackout period restrictions, and other factors. The purchase price of any Common Shares will be determined in accordance with applicable U.S. securities laws. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased approximately million of Aurinia's common shares for million (including transaction costs, which consist of commissions and excise tax). The cost of repurchased shares are reported as a reduction in common shares and under Alberta law, the shares were cancelled and not reissued.

 million shares (inclusive of then outstanding awards) and provides for grants of stock options, performance awards (PAs), and restricted stock units (RSUs) that may be settled in cash and common shares. Also in June 2021, the Company's shareholders adopted and approved the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2021 ESPP), which allows for the issuance of up to million shares. The 2021 ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code but also permits the Company to include the employees, including non-United States employees, in offerings not intended to qualify under Section 423. The purpose of the 2021 ESPP is to provide eligible employees with opportunities to purchase the Company s common shares at a discounted price. As of September 30, 2024, million shares have been purchased under the ESPP. 
 In addition to stock options, PAs and RSUs granted under the Plan, the Company has granted certain stock options and RSUs as inducements material to new employees entering employment in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). The inducements were granted outside of the Plan. 
 Stock Options 
 The Plan requires the exercise price of each option not to be less than the closing market price of the Company s common shares on the business day immediately prior to the date of grant. The Board approves the vesting criteria and periods at its discretion. The options issued under the Plan are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payments. 
 The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the options granted. The assumptions used for the annual volatility and expected life of the options are reviewed and updated annually. The Company considers historical volatility of its common shares in estimating its future stock price volatility. The risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the options was based on the yield available on government benchmark bonds with an approximate equivalent

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act), which are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections, as well as forward-looking information as defined in applicable Canadian securities laws. Forward-looking statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects and plans; objectives of management; the key potential benefits of LUPKYNIS; our anticipation of a one-time restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2024 of 15 to 19 million, with post restructuring annualized cash-based operating expense savings of more than 40 million; our estimate that we will reduce our workforce by approximately 45 ; our expectation that our restructuring will further improve operational efficiency; our estimate, based on our patient-specific estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) dosing regimens, the average utilization in our clinical trials, and accounting for factors including mandatory rebates, channel discounts, and anticipated patient adherence, that we expect our average annualized net realizable revenue per patient to be approximately 70,000 to 75,000; timing for data the AUR200 SAD study; our belief that we have sufficient financial resources to fund our current plans for at least the next few years; and our potential to receive certain payments and royalties under our agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., or Otsuka. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, could, would, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, project, predict, propose, intend, continue, potential, possible, foreseeable, likely, unforeseen and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance, time frames or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, time frames or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We have made numerous assumptions about the forward-looking statements and information contained herein, including among other things, assumptions about: the accuracy of reported data from third-party studies and reports; that our IP rights are valid and do not infringe the IP rights of third parties; our assumptions relating to the capital required to fund operations for the next few years; the timing and ability to execute on our restructuring plans; the costs, benefits and scope of our restructuring plans; the assumption that our current good relationships with our suppliers, service providers and other third parties will be maintained; assumptions relating to the burn rate of our cash for operations; assumptions relating to the capital required to fund operations for the next few years; assumptions relating to the progress of our pre-clinical activities that our third party service providers will comply with their contractual obligations. Even though management believes that the assumptions made, and the expectations represented by such statements or information are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate.

Given these risks, uncertainties and other factors, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this filing. You should read this discussion completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We hereby qualify our forward-looking statements by our cautionary statements.

 Overview 
 Aurinia is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering therapies to people living with autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical needs. In January 2021, we introduced LUPKYNIS (voclosporin), the first FDA-approved oral therapy for the treatment of adult patients with active LN. We continue to conduct clinical and regulatory activities to support the LUPKYNIS development program. We contracted with Otsuka as a collaboration partner for the development and commercialization of LUPKYNIS in the Otsuka Territories. 
 The price of LUPKYNIS is based on one unit of 60 capsules we refer to as a wallet . As of January 1, 2024, the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of a LUPKYNIS wallet is 4,898. Based on our patient-specific eGFR dosing regimens, the average utilization in our clinical trials, and accounting for factors including mandatory rebates, channel discounts, and anticipated patient adherence, duration of therapy and compliance, we have adjusted our expected average annualized net realizable revenue per patient to be approximately 70,000 - 75,000. When determining the price of LUPKYNIS, we considered the burden of LN disease in the context of value that LUPKYNIS offers to patients and the U.S. healthcare system. 
 20 

On February 15, 2024, the Company announced the conclusion of its previously announced strategic review process and actions designed to enhance shareholder value. Aurinia executed a corporate restructuring in the first quarter that reduced employee headcount by approximately 25 and discontinued its AUR300 research and development program. For further discussion, refer to Note 19, Restructuring. 
 On November 7, 2024, Aurinia announced it was implementing a strategic restructuring to sharpen the Company's focus on continued LUPKYNIS growth and the rapid development of AUR200. The restructuring will result in a workforce reduction of approximately 45 and Aurinia anticipates a one-time restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2024 of approximately 15 to 19 million and will focus the Company s LUPKYNIS commercial strategy on the highest growth drivers. The restructuring will also improve operational efficiency, with anticipated post-restructuring annualized cash savings of more than 40 million. 
 The Company is also developing its pipeline asset AUR200, a differentiated, potential next generation therapy for autoimmune diseases that targets both BAFF (B-cell Activating Factor) and APRIL (A Proliferation-Inducing Ligand). 
 
 Recent Developments 
 On September 5, 2024, the Company announced the first participant has been dosed in a Phase 1 SAD study of AUR200, a differentiated, potential best-in-class therapy for autoimmune diseases that targets both BAFF and APRIL. The SAD study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and changes in biomarkers for AUR200 in healthy volunteers, with data expected in the first half of 2025. 
 On September 24, 2024, the Company announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare has approved LUPKYNIS in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to treat LN. As part of the December 2020 agreement with Otsuka, the Company is eligible to receive a payment of 10.0 million U.S. dollars upon approval in Japan along with low double-digit royalties on net sales once launched. As a result, the 10.0 million milestone was recognized as collaboration revenue in the quarter. 
 In September 2024, the Board appointed Kevin Tang, President of Tang Capital Management, LLC, a life sciences-focused investment company that he founded in 2002, as a Director and Chair of the Board. Mr. Tang has more than 20 years of experience investing in, governing and leading companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. The Company also announced the acceptance of the conditional resignations of three directors who received less than majority support at the 2024 Annual General Meeting. 
 Effective November 7, 2024, Aurinia appointed Craig Johnson to the Board. Mr. Johnson has more than 30 years of experience serving in senior financial management roles and governing companies in the biotechnology industry. 
 The Company also announced that Dr. Robert T. Foster has retired from the Board effective November 5, 2024. 
 
 Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 other than as stated below. 
 Product Revenues 
 We sell LUPKYNIS (voclosporin) primarily to specialty pharmacies and a specialty distributor and semi-finished product directly to our ex-U.S. partner Otsuka. These customers subsequently distribute our products. Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs upon delivery to the customer. 
 Reserves for discounts and allowances: Product sales are recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). 
 Our estimates of reserves established for variable consideration are calculated based upon utilizing the expected value method. The transaction price, which includes variable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of 
 21 

the cumulative revenues recognized will not occur in a future period. Amounts related to such items are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. 
 Significant judgment is required in estimating variable consideration. In making these estimates, we consider historical data, including patient mix to accrue for variable consideration related to inventory sold to our customers that has not yet been dispensed to patients. We use a data aggregator and historical claims to estimate variable consideration for inventory sold to our specialty pharmacies that has not yet been dispensed. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material adjustments to variable consideration estimates based on actual results. These specific adjustments are detailed further in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 compared to Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2023 
 The following table sets forth our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

Total Revenue, Net 
 Total net revenue was 67.8 million and 54.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Total net revenue was 175.3 million and 130.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 We currently sell to two main specialty pharmacies for U.S. commercial sales of LUPKYNIS and a collaboration partnership with Otsuka for sales of semi-finished product and license, collaboration, and royalty revenue in the Otsuka Territories. 
 The percentage of total net revenues from our main customers were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 2024 2023 Two main specialty pharmacies 
 81 77 87 90 Collaboration partnership 
 16 21 11 9 
 Product Revenue, Net 
 Net product revenue was 55.5 million and 40.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net product revenue was 158.6 million and 116.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in both periods is primarily due to increased LUPKYNIS sales to our two main specialty pharmacies, driven predominantly by further penetration of the LN market. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had sales of semi-finished product to Otsuka as Otsuka continues to commercialize in its territories. 
 The U.S. penetration can be demonstrated by a total of approximately 2,422 patients on therapy as of September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 1,939 patients on therapy as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, our 12-month persistency rate has increased to 57 at September 30, 2024, from approximately 54 at September 30, 2023. 
 License, Collaboration, and Royalty Revenues 
 License, collaboration, and royalty revenues were 12.3 million and 13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. License, collaboration, and royalty revenues were 16.7 million and 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The revenue is primarily due to a 10.0 million milestone recognized in third quarter of 2024 for the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare approval of LUPKYNIS and a 10.0 million milestone recognized in third quarter of 2023 for pricing and reimbursement approval in certain European jurisdictions, coupled with manufacturing services revenue from Otsuka related to shared capacity services that commenced in late June 2023. 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales was 6.0 million and 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Cost of sales was 22.7 million and 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to inventory write downs and semi-finished product sales to Otsuka in the prior three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for 
 23 

the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to the amortization of the monoplant finance right of use asset, which was placed into service in late June 2023 and therefore only partially impacted prior year results. 
 Gross Margin 
 Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, was approximately 91 and 88 , respectively. Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, was approximately 87 and 93 , respectively. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A expenses decreased to 42.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 47.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, SG A expenses were 135.0 million and 145.0 million, respectively. SG A expenses consisted of the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Salaries, incentive pay and employee benefits 17,563 19,563 57,493 61,851 Professional fees and services 11,982 12,716 38,727 37,202 Share-based compensation expense 7,812 9,560 23,427 26,969 Other public company costs, facility costs, insurance, information technology, amortization of property and equipment 2,728 3,284 8,225 10,546 Travel, trade shows and sponsorships 2,282 2,636 7,124 8,396 42,367 47,759 134,996 144,964 
 The primary drivers for the decrease in both periods were lower employee related costs including share-based compensation and overhead costs due to the reduction in general and administrative headcount, which occurred late in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 R D expenses were 3.0 million and 13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, R D expenses were 12.7 million and 39.4 million, respectively. R D expenses consisted of the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Contract research organizations (CRO) and developmental expenses 1,380 5,751 6,486 14,046 Clinical supply and distribution 354 2,208 2,353 8,355 Salaries, incentive pay and employee benefits 900 3,619 5,240 10,879 Share-based compensation expense 306 1,975 (1,773) 5,679 Other costs 107 52 372 454 3,047 13,605 12,678 39,413 
 
 The primary drivers for the decrease in both periods were lower employee costs related to the reduction in headcount, which occurred late in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of expenses related to ceasing our AUR300 development program, and lower expenses related to developing AUR200. 
 24 

Restructuring Expenses 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring expenses were approximately nil and 7.8 million and nil for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Restructuring expenses primarily included employee severance, one-time benefit payments, and contract termination expenses related to the restructuring, which occurred late in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Other Expense (Income), net 
 
 Other expense (income), net was 4.6 million and 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Other expense (income), net was 0.2 million and (0.7) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The change is primarily driven by changes in the fair value assumptions related to our deferred compensation liability and the foreign exchange remeasurement of the monoplant lease liability, which commenced in June 2023 and is denominated in CHF. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 1.2 million and 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest expense was 3.7 million and 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The interest expense is due to the monoplant finance lease, which commenced in June 2023. 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 Interest income was 4.3 million and 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest income was 13.0 million and 12.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of approximately 37.1 million and investments of 311.6 million compared to cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of 48.9 million and investments of 301.8 million at December 31, 2023. Cash needs were primarily related to the continued investment in LUPKYNIS commercialization activities, post approval commitments for LUPKYNIS, monoplant payments, share repurchases and restructuring related payments and were partially offset by an increase in cash receipts from sales of LUPKYNIS and cash payments from Otsuka. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments are primarily held in U.S. dollars. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had working capital of 361.9 million and 347.6 million, respectively. 
 We are devoting the majority of our operational efforts and financial resources towards the commercialization and post- approval commitments for LUPKYNIS. Taking into consideration the cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of September 30, 2024, we believe that our cash position is sufficient to fund our current plans which include funding commercial activities, such as our FDA related post approval commitments, manufacturing and packaging commercial drug supply, funding our supporting commercial infrastructure, advancement of our pipeline, funding our working capital obligations and share repurchases for at least the next few years.

Cash Flow Summary 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities 14,274 (47,773) Investing activities 39 (449) Financing activities (26,046) 447 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
 (11,733) (47,775) 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 14.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities of 47.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from sales of LUPKYNIS and cash receipts from Otsuka, coupled with a reduction in operating expenses year over year, as a result of the restructuring in the first quarter of 2024. See "Total Revenue" above for further discussion regarding our increased sales of LUPKYNIS. 
 Cash provided by investing activities was 39 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used of 0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily related to the timing of purchases and proceeds of investments and an upfront capital expenditure payment for the monoplant in 2023. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 26.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by financing activities of 0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to share repurchases, which began in February 2024, and quarterly lease payments for our monoplant finance lease, which commenced during the third quarter of 2023. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 In February 2024, the Board approved a share repurchase program of up to 150 million of our common shares. On February 29, 2024, Canadian securities regulators granted exemptive relief for the Company s share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to 15 percent of its issued and outstanding shares in any 12-month period for up to 36 months, including under the current program. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased approximately 3.4 million of our common shares for 18.6 million (including transaction costs which consist of commissions and excise tax). The cost of repurchased shares are reported as a reduction in common shares and under Alberta law, the shares were cancelled and not reissued. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations and commitments as described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks 
 Our activities can expose us to market risks which include interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, inflation risk and credit risk. Risk management is carried out by management under policies approved by the Board, with oversight provided by the Audit Committee of the Board. Our overall risk management program seeks to minimize adverse effects on our financial performance. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Financial assets and financial liabilities with variable interest rates expose us to cash flow interest rate risk. We manage our interest rate risk by maximizing the interest income earned on excess funds while maintaining the liquidity necessary to conduct 
 operations on a day-to-day basis. As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio includes cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments of 348.7 million that earn interest at various rates. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. Our investments held during the year were comprised of highly rated instruments such as certificates of deposits, money market instruments, obligations issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government agencies as well as corporate debt securities. As of September 30, 2024, these instruments primarily have a maturity of less than a year. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points on the interest rates of our investments would result annually in approximately 3.1 million less interest in our portfolio. We do not believe that the results of operations or cash flows would be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates relative to our investment portfolio, due to the short-term nature of the investments and our current ability to hold these investments to maturity. 
 
 Accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities bear no interest unless payments are not received timely. We do not believe that our results of operations or cash flows would be affected to a significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates relative to our investment portfolio. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 We are exposed to financial risk related to the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency risk for the Company is the risk variations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, primarily with the Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Great Britain Pound, which could affect our operating and financial results. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an 80.7 million finance lease liability on our balance sheet related to the monoplant. An assumed 10 fluctuation in the Swiss franc would have an approximate 8.1 million fluctuation in the valuation of the lease liability. 
 
 There were no other foreign currency fluctuations that would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Inflation Risk 
 
 Inflation has been volatile in recent periods and may continue to be volatile in the future. Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor, commercial support, manufacturing and clinical trial expenditures. In addition, inflation also impacts our government and payer rebates as it pertains to the consumer price index (CPI) penalty. Our investment portfolio may experience the risk of realized losses on our investments if we were to sell before maturity due to the market volatility caused by increased interest rates. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Our exposure to credit risk generally consists of cash and cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. We place our cash and cash equivalents with highly rated financial institutions and invest the excess cash in highly rated investments. It is the 
 Company's intent for these investments to have an overall rating of A-1, or higher, by Standard Poor s, or an equivalent rating by Moody s or Fitch. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer. 
 
 We are subject to credit risk in connection with our accounts receivable due from our two main specialty pharmacies for U.S. commercial sales, specialty distributor and collaboration partnership with Otsuka which accounted for the majority of our accounts receivable, net balances as of September 30, 2024. We monitor economic conditions, including the creditworthiness of 
 27 

our customers and collaboration partner. We regularly communicate with our customers regarding the status of receivable balances and have not experienced and issues with collectability. The timing between the recognition of revenue for product sales and the receipt of payment is not significant. Our standard credit terms range from 30 to 45 days. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we did not recognize any allowance for credit losses related to credit risk for our customers or write any amounts off. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, have concluded that, based on such evaluation, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. For further discussion, refer to Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies. 
 Other than as set out below, there are no material developments to report in respect of the litigation described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 On April 15, 2022, a purported shareholder class action complaint, Ortmann v. Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al., case no. 1:22-cv-02185, was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Eastern District of New York), naming the Company and certain of its officers as defendants. The lawsuit alleges that the Company made materially false and misleading statements regarding its financial guidance and commercial prospects in violation of certain federal securities laws. The plaintiff sought unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees. On June 2, 2022, the case was transferred from the Eastern District of New York to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. On February 20, 2023, the Court appointed a lead plaintiff and approved lead plaintiff s selection of lead counsel. On May 22, 2023, the lead plaintiff filed its amended complaint. On October 20, 2023, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint (the "Motion to Dismiss"). On December 8, 2023, the lead plaintiff filed its opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. On January 12, 2024, the Company filed its reply in support of the Motion to Dismiss. On August 13, 2024, the Court entered an order granting the Motion to Dismiss, with prejudice. The lead plaintiff did not file a motion for reconsideration or appeal the Court's order, and as such the action is dismissed in its entirety. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report. There has been no material change in our risk factors subsequent to the filing of our prior reports referenced above, other than as set out below. However, the risks described in our reports are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we currently deem to be immaterial or not currently known to us, as well as other risks reported from time to time in our reports to the SEC, also could cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. 
 Aurinia's restructuring program and associated organizational changes may not adequately reduce its operating costs or improve operating margins, may lead to additional workforce attrition, and may cause operational disruptions, and there can be no assurance that Aurinia will realize the anticipated benefits of the restructuring program. 
 On November 7, 2024, Aurinia announced it was implementing a strategic restructuring to sharpen the Company's focus on continued LUPKYNIS growth and the rapid development of AUR200. This restructuring will result in a workforce reduction of approximately 45 and anticipates a one-time restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2024 of approximately 15 to 19 million and will focus the Company s LUPKYNIS commercial strategy on the highest growth drivers. 
 
 The estimates of charges and expenditures, and the associated annual cost savings, Aurinia expects to incur in connection with the restructuring program, and timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions, and Aurinia may incur costs that are greater, or recognize lower annual cost savings, than Aurinia currently anticipates in connection with the restructuring program. 
 
 The restructuring program may yield unintended consequences, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, employee attrition beyond Aurinia's intended reduction in force, a reduction in morale among Aurinia's remaining employees, greater than anticipated costs incurred in connection with implementing the restructuring program, and the risks that Aurinia may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the restructuring program to the extent or as quickly as Aurinia anticipates, if at all, all of which may materially adversely affect Aurinia's results of operations or financial condition. These restructuring initiatives could place substantial demands on Aurinia's management and employees, which could lead to the diversion of management s and employees attention from other business priorities. In addition, while certain positions are being eliminated in connection with the restructuring program, many functions necessary to Aurinia's reduced operations remain, and Aurinia may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among its remaining employees or to 
 29 

external service providers, which could result in disruptions to Aurinia's operations. Aurinia may also discover that the workforce reduction and other restructuring efforts will make it difficult for Aurinia to pursue new opportunities and initiatives and require Aurinia to hire qualified replacement personnel, which may require Aurinia to incur additional and unanticipated costs and expenses. Aurinia may further discover that, despite the implementation of its restructuring program, Aurinia may require additional capital to continue expanding its business, and Aurinia may not be able to obtain such capital on acceptable terms, if at all. Aurinia's failure to successfully accomplish any of the above activities and goals may have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Additionally, the workforce reduction Aurinia will implement as part of the restructuring program may negatively impact its ability to attract, integrate, retain and motivate highly qualified employees, and may harm Aurinia's reputation with current or prospective employees.

 (1) The approximate value of shares that may yet be purchased under the program does not include commissions that may be paid to brokers in connection with such purchases. 
 (2) The approximate dollar value of shares that may be purchased under the program may differ from time to time from the value set out in the table above, as the Company is limited in how much it may repurchase both by the maximum dollar value of the program established by the Board, and also the maximum number of shares that may be repurchased in any 12 month period is limited by the Exemptive Relief (which may produce a lower maximum dollar value depending on the prices that common shares are repurchased under the program). As of September 30, 2024, the maximum dollar value would be approximately 131.6 million.
