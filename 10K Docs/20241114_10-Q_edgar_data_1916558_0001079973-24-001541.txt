ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of
our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to
those statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and
analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected
events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not
limited to, those discussed under the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this prospectus. See the section titled
 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements elsewhere in this prospectus. 

 Overview 

We specialize in the development, manufacturing, and
distribution of nutrient-rich foods, setting ourselves apart by integrating insect-based proteins into our products. Our primary business
product line is marketed under the brand Universal Proteins (UP). Our current product line is based on protein bars. The Company has plans
for a secondary business focus to include pet foods, with a particular emphasis on developing, manufacturing, and distributing dog treats
designed to alleviate pain. 

In early 2022, we began formulating recipes
using insect protein powder derived from crickets. Our CEO, Andrew Read, in collaboration with a nutritionist, formulated two different
recipes for the preparation of the first protein bars. During this process we narrowed our primary protein source to cricket (Orthoptera)
powder from ENTOMO FARMS, a Canadian Company that has supplied protein powder from crickets for over 10 years. 

 Following the initial development of our first
bars, we conducted a taste test to finalize the ingredients. Subsequently, we initiated the process of partnering with a copacker/manufacturer.
In March 2022, we visited the YouBar facility in Los Angeles, California, and enlisted their expertise to consult on and develop our initial
two bars, also referred to as SKUs: Chocolate Almond and Peanut Butter and Fruit. YouBar has developed and manufactured protein bars since
2006 for companies whose bars are sold in well-known retail establishments such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Costco, Target, Amazon,
and GNS, according to their website www.youbars.com. 

 The R D collaboration with YouBar spanned
almost a year to develop the first two flavors (SKUs). This comprehensive process involved testing various ingredient combinations for
optimal taste, experimenting with baking or rolling techniques for the bars, and refining the product to facilitate mass production. Youbar
sourced material for additional bar ingredients, such as: fruits, and flavors, all of which received subsequent approval by the Company. 

 Following the approval process, we progressed
to the packaging development and manufacturing phase, which lasted approximately nine months. Tradewinds was selective in the type of
products and service providers it used for each aspect of packaging. Manufacturing and packaging of the two formulated SKUs were completed
and shipped on December 4, 2023, at which time we received the first order, which included 10,848 peanut butter fruit bars and 10,764
chocolate almond bars. We have initiated online marketing and sales of the UP-protein bars; however, our main focus has been directed
toward larger retail outlets and distributors such as Trader Joe s, Costco, and Coremark. We anticipate that it may take an uncertain
amount of time to secure a sales order from larger retailers, if it happens at all. In April of 2024 we entered into a purchase agreement
with a smaller distributor for 1,040 cases of UP bars containing 12,480 bars for 24,960. At September 30, 2024, all bars in inventory
had been sold. 

 Raw materials used in the protein bars are
generic to energy\protein bars sourced by Youbar. The availability of ingredients is subject to standard supply and demand for energy
bars. Protein Cricket Powder protein is purchased from Entomo Farms, a Company based out of Canada that has supplied protein powder from
crickets for over 10 years. All ingredients required for the manufacturing of the bars are currently abundant. 

 Our UP Protein Bars are currently available
for purchase on our website, UPProteins.com. We have initiated a marketing program directed at retail outlets using social media platforms,
as mentioned in our Business Description on Page 12. We anticipate the completion of one more new SKUs for a bar by the end of
the year 2024. The Company has plans for a secondary business focus to include pet foods and has acquired a formula for developing, manufacturing,
and distributing dog treats to alleviate pain. In addition, we plan to continue to market Distribution Rights to various territories.
We also plan to continue to market the licensing rights for our formula for pain relief for dogs. However, there is no assurance that
licensing rights or products can be sold sufficiently to assist with our operational plan. We anticipate raising capital through revenues
from the sale of licensing rights or some form of debt or equity financing. At this time, we have no arrangements for any funding source. 

 We expect our operating expenses to significantly
increase as we continue to develop additional product lines and establish a market for our current product line. We also expect to incur
additional operating expenses as we begin operating as a public company. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter
and year to year, depending on the timing and scope of our marketing and our expenditures on other research and development activities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 As of September 30, 2024 , we had cash and
cash equivalents of 3,903. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through revenue generated from operations, private placements
of our securities and advances from our founder. 

 Management has prepared estimates of operations
and believes it will have sufficient funds to fund our operations and to service our debt obligations for at least the next twelve months.
We may, however, in the future require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions, implementation of our strategy to
expand our business, or other investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our own financial resources are insufficient to
satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The
sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased
debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing
may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable
to us, or at all, could limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects. 

 The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis under which we are expected to be able to realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities in the normal
course of business. 

11 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2024, compared to September 30, 2023 

 The change in stockholders' equity at September
30, 2024, was primarily attributable to operating losses incurred in the period. In the fourth quarter of 2023 22,000,000 shares were
issued to our President which was the primary reason for the change. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, we used 24,310
in operating activities compared to 68,763 used in operating activities during September 30, 2023. 

 Investing Activities 

 For September 30, 2024, we had no investing
activities and for September 30, 2023 we used 1,500 in investing activities for an intangible asset for website development. 

 Financing Activities 

 Our financing activities generally consist
of the proceeds from the sale of our common stock. During September 30, 2024, we had 0 in financing activity, and September 30, 2023
we had 22,000 in financing activities from the issuance of stock. 

 The Company believes it has insufficient cash
resources available to fund its primary operation. The Company has no, current, off-balance sheet arrangements and does not anticipate
entering into any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition.
The Company has no agreements in place with its shareholders, officer and director or with any third parties to fund operations beyond
the end of the Company's 4th quarter. The Company has not negotiated nor has available to it any other third-party sources of liquidity. 

 Off Balance Sheet Items 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other
relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as special purpose entities (SPEs). 

Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experiences and
on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

As a smaller
reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial
and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by our Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of September 30,2024, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms due to material weaknesses
in our internal controls as described in the December 31, 2023 annual report. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

We have made no change in our internal control over
financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
