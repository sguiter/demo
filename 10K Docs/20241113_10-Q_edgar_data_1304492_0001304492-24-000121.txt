In September 2023, the Company transferred to SDG E the San Diego County broadband license and received a milestone payment of million net of delivery delay adjustments of million. In December 2023, the Company transferred to SDG E the remainder of the cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband license related to Imperial County and received a milestone payment of million. This resulted in the recognition of a gain on the sale of spectrum and derecognition of the contingent liability associated with San Diego County and Imperial County. See Note 4 Intangible Assets for further discussion on the sale of intangible assets. 
 Subsequent to the derecognition of the contingent liability related to the delivery of San Diego County and Imperial County licenses, the remaining contingent liability related to SDG E of million for Orange County is classified as a short-term liability due to the expected timing of delivery. 
 
 LCRA Refund Obligation 
 In April 2023, the Company entered into the LCRA Agreement for a total payment of million, to be paid through fiscal year 2026 pursuant to the terms of the agreement. In December 2023, the Company received million in milestone payments, of which million was deposited in an escrow account. The remaining payments are due as the Company delivers the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses to LCRA. As the Company is required to refund the deposit it has received from LCRA in the

 million, to be paid through fiscal year 2026 pursuant to the terms of the agreement. In June 2024, the Company received an initial payment of million with remaining payments due to the Company for each county, at closing. The timing and rights to milestone payments could vary as 900 MHz broadband licenses are granted by the FCC, broadband licenses are assigned to Oncor and incumbents are cleared by the Company. As the Company is required to refund the deposit it has received from Oncor in the event of termination or non-delivery of the specific county s full cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum, it recorded the initial payment as contingent liability on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. A reduction in the contingent liability and a gain or loss on the sale of spectrum will be recognized for each county once the Company delivers the full cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband license(s) to Oncor. 
 Xcel Energy Guaranty 
 
 In October 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Xcel Energy Services Inc. Xcel Energy providing Xcel Energy dedicated long-term usage of the Company s 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum for a term of years throughout Xcel Energy s service territory in eight states (the Xcel Energy Agreement ). In connection with Xcel Energy Agreement, the Company entered into a guaranty agreement, under which the Company guaranteed the delivery of the relevant 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses in Xcel Energy s service territory in eight states along with other commercial obligations. In the event of default or non-delivery of the specific territory s 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum, the Company is required to refund payments it has received. In addition, to the extent Anterix has performed any obligations, the Company s liability and remaining obligations under the Xcel Energy Agreement will extend only to the remaining unperformed obligations. The Company recorded million in deferred revenue in connection with the prepayments received as of September 30, 2024. The Company commenced delivery of the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband leases in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and will continue through 2029. The revenue recognized for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum potential liability of future undiscounted payments under this agreement is approximately million. 
 Litigation 
 From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation that arises from the ordinary operations of the business, such as contractual or employment disputes or other general actions. The Company is not involved in any material legal proceedings at this time. 
 Pandemic and Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Recent macroeconomic events, inflation and geopolitical matters, have increased operating costs or resulted in delays in customer contracting or impacted the availability of equipment necessary for the deployment of the Company s target customers planned PLTE projects. The Company continues to closely monitor these risks. Although difficult to quantify, the Company believes the current macroeconomic environment, including inflation, may have an adverse effect on the Company s target customers businesses, which may harm the Company s commercialization efforts and negatively impact the Company s revenues and liquidity. If the Company is not able to control its operating costs or if the Company s commercialization efforts are slowed or negatively impacted, continued periods of high inflation could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, operating results and financial condition.

 Results of Operations 
 A discussion and analysis of the primary factors contributing to our results of operations are presented below. The following tables summarize our results of operations and financial data for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following data should be read in conjunction with our Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Quarterly Report. 
 Three months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Spectrum revenue 1,551 1,052 3,076 1,660 Operating expenses General and administrative 11,397 11,905 24,248 23,578 Sales and support 1,357 1,310 3,207 2,585 Product development 1,776 1,147 3,526 2,216 Depreciation and amortization 151 209 330 455 Operating expenses 14,681 14,571 31,311 28,834 Gain on disposal of intangible assets, net (8,513) (93) (19,298) Gain on sale of intangible assets, net (7,332) (7,332) Loss from disposal of long-lived assets, net 67 36 (Loss) gain from operations (13,130) 2,259 (28,142) (580) Interest income 585 396 1,279 782 Other income 9 63 25 158 (Loss) income before income taxes (12,536) 2,718 (26,838) 360 Income tax expense 230 645 1,452 405 Net (loss) income (12,766) 2,073 (28,290) (45) 
 Summary 
 Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 14.8 million to 12.8 million net loss from 2.1 million net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the following: 
 Spectrum revenues increased by 0.5 million, or 47 , to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our spectrum revenue was primarily attributable to revenue recognized in connection with our agreement with Xcel Energy of approximately 0.4 million and our agreement with Evergy of approximately 0.1 million. 
 Product development expenses increased by 0.6 million, or 55 , to 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.1 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from 0.4 million higher headcount related costs and 0.2 million in IT related costs. 
 Gain on disposal of intangible assets, net decreased by 8.5 million, or 100 , to 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 we did not exchange our narrowband licenses for broadband licenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we exchanged our narrowband licenses for broadband licenses in 5 counties. In connection with the exchange, we recorded an estimated accounting cost basis of 10.8 million for the new broadband licenses and disposed of 2.3 million related to the value ascribed to the narrowband licenses we relinquished to the FCC for those same 5 counties. As a result, we recorded a 8.5 million non-monetary gain on disposal of the intangible assets on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Interest income increased by 0.2 million, or 48 , to 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.4 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher average cash balance during the period .

Table of Contents 

 Income tax expense decreased by 0.4 million, or 64 , to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.6 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to prior year higher state effective tax rate due to taxable income related to the sale of intangible assets. 
 Our net loss for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 28.2 million to 28.3 million from 45 thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the following: 
 Spectrum revenues increased by 1.4 million, or 85 , to 3.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our spectrum revenue was primarily attributable to revenue recognized in connection with our agreement with Xcel Energy of approximately 1.2 million and our agreement with Evergy of approximately 0.2 million. 
 Product development expenses increased by 1.3 million, or 59 , to 3.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.2 million for six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from 0.5 million higher contract consulting fees, 0.4 million in higher headcount related costs and 0.4 million in IT related costs. 
 Sales and support expense increased by 0.6 million, or 24 , to 3.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.6 million for six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from 0.5 million higher headcount related costs, 0.3 million fees related to the Oncor Agreement, partially offset by 0.2 million in lower contract consulting fees. 
 Gain on disposal of intangible assets, net decreased by 19.2 million, or 100 , to 0.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. During the six months ended September 30, 2024 we exchanged our narrowband license for a broadband license in 1 county. In connection with the exchange, we recorded an estimated accounting cost basis of 0.1 million for the new broadband license and relinquished to the FCC narrowband license for the same 1 county with de minimis value. As a result, we recorded a 0.1 million non-monetary gain on disposal of the intangible assets on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the six months ended September 30, 2023, we exchanged our narrowband licenses for broadband licenses in 14 counties. In connection with the exchange, we recorded an estimated accounting cost basis of 24.1 million for the new broadband licenses and disposed of 4.8 million related to the value ascribed to the narrowband licenses we relinquished to the FCC for those same 14 counties. As a result, we recorded a 19.3 million non-monetary gain on disposal of the intangible assets on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Interest income increased by 0.5 million, or 64 , to 1.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.8 million for six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher average cash balance during the period . 
 Income tax expense increased by 1.0 million, or 259 , to 1.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.4 million for six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher state effective tax rate due to taxable income related to customer milestone payments. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents generated from customer contract proceeds. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 43.1 million. 
 
 We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, along with contracted proceeds from customers, will be sufficient to meet our financial obligations through at least 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report. As noted above, our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including among others, future customer contracts, the costs and timing of our spectrum retuning activities, spectrum acquisitions and the Anti-Windfall Payments to the U.S. Treasury, our operating activities, any cash proceeds we generate through our commercialization activities, our ability to timely deliver broadband licenses to our customers in accordance with our contractual obligations and our obligation to refund payments or pay penalties if we do not meet our commercial obligations. We deploy this capital at our determined pace based on several key ongoing factors, including customer demand, market opportunity, and offsetting income from spectrum leases. We cannot reasonably estimate any potential impact to our results of operations, commercialization efforts and financial condition arising from changes to our macroeconomic, legal or regulatory environment, including potential legislation affecting the energy or utility industry, the telecommunications environment, or supply chains. We are actively managing our business to maintain our cash flow and believe that we currently have adequate liquidity. To implement our business

 plans and initiatives, however, we may need to raise additional capital. We cannot predict with certainty the exact amount or timing for any future capital raises. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report for a reference to the risks and uncertainties that could cause our costs to be more than we currently anticipate and/or our revenue and operating results to be lower than we currently anticipate. If required, we intend to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing or through some other financing arrangement. However, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available if and when needed, or that, if available, we can obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders and to us. Any failure to obtain financing when required will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 
 Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities 
 Six months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (5,009) 2,213 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (10,945) 14,889 Net cash used in financing activities (1,433) (11,750) 
 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities 
 Our principal source of cash provided by operating activities is our customer contract proceeds in the form of advanced payments. For spectrum revenue agreements, we record these advanced payments as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize revenue over the term of the lease, which is typically 20 to 30 years. For spectrum sale agreements, we record advanced payments as a contingent liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and derecognize this liability upon closing of the sale along with recording a gain or loss on sale. In addition, our cash flows reflect a non-cash gain or loss on disposal of intangible assets for the difference in cost basis as we exchange narrowband licenses for broadband licenses. We expect net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to be affected by the progress on our customer agreements as well as changes in other operating assets and liabilities. The following represents our changes in net cash (used in) provided by operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 5.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the following: 
 28.3 million decrease related to our operating loss, which includes 10.2 million of non-cash items (refer to the Results of Operations ); 
 1.5 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily due to annual bonus payments; 
 4.4 million increase in deferred revenue due to 7.5 million cash proceeds from Ameren Corporation related to our 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum contract offset by 3.1 million in revenue recognition in connection with the delivery of cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum; and 
 10.0 million increase in contingent liability related to the Oncor Agreement. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 2.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the following: 
 45 thousand decrease related to our operating loss, which includes 17.1 million of non-cash items (refer to the Results of Operations ); and 
 19.5 million increase in deferred revenue due to 21.2 million cash proceeds from our 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum customer prepayments offset by 1.7 million in revenue recognition in connection with the delivery of cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum. 
 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities 
 Our principal outflow of cash used in investing activities is our purchases of intangible assets, including refundable deposits, retuning costs and swaps, which represent our spectrum clearing efforts as we work toward the conversion from narrowband to broadband spectrum. The purchases of intangible assets may be offset by current period cash proceeds from the sale of intangible assets, with a potential non-cash derecognition of the contingent liability for any proceeds received and recognized in operating activities in a prior period. We expect net cash provided by (used in) investing activities to be affected by the timing of our spectrum clearing efforts and the closing of our sale transactions and the related transfer of

 broadband licenses. The following represents our changes in net cash (used in) provided by investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 10.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 14.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was primarily from 10.9 million payments made to acquire, swap or retune wireless licenses in markets across the United States. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was primarily from 25.2 million sale of spectrum related to our transfer of the San Diego County broadband license to SDG E partially offset by 10.1 million payments made to acquire, swap or retune wireless licenses in markets across the United States. 
 Net cash used in financing activities 
 Our principal outflow of cash used in financing activities is a result of our equity transactions, including repurchases of common stock and taxes and fees associated with the issuance of restricted stock awards, offset by proceeds from stock options exercised in the period. We expect net cash used in financing activities to be affected by the timing of future equity transactions including the timing of our repurchases of common stock. The following represents our changes in net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 1.4 million and 11.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was primarily for the repurchases of common stock of 2.0 million, payments of withholding tax on net issuance of restricted stock of 1.4 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock option exercises of 2.0 million. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was from the repurchase of common stock of 10.7 million and payments of withholding tax on net issuance of restricted stock of 1.0 million. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: costs and time related to the commercialization of our spectrum assets; and our ability to sign customer contracts and generate revenues from the license or transfer of any broadband licenses we secure; our ability to timely deliver broadband licenses and clear spectrum to our customers in accordance with our contractual obligation; any requirement to refund payments or pay penalties if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations; the timeline and costs to acquire broadband licenses pursuant to the Report and Order, including the costs to acquire additional spectrum, the costs related to retuning, or swapping spectrum held by 900 MHz site-based licensees in the broadband segment that is required under section 90.621(b) to be protected by a broadband licensee with a base station at any location within the county, or any 900 MHz geographic-based SMR licensee in the broadband segment whose license area completely or partially overlaps the county, and the costs of paying Anti-Windfall Payments to the U.S. Treasury. 
 We are obligated under certain lease agreements for office space with lease terms expiring on various dates from October 31, 2024 through January 31, 2029, which includes a three to ten-year lease extension for our corporate headquarters. We have also entered into multiple lease agreements for tower space related to our spectrum holdings. The lease expiration dates range from November 30, 2024 to September 3, 2031. Total estimated payments for these lease agreements are approximately 6.5 million (exclusive of real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance and other costs borne by us). We also have an obligation to clear the tower site locations, for which we recorded an asset retirement obligation (the ARO ). Total estimated payments as a result of the ARO is approximately 0.7 million. In addition to the lease payments and ARO for our tower site locations, we entered into agreements with several third parties in multiple U.S. markets to acquire, retune or swap wireless licenses for cash consideration deals ). As of September 30, 2024, our total estimated future payments for these agreements with incumbents are approximately 9.4 million . 
 Xcel Energy Guaranty 
 
 In October 2022, we entered into an agreement with Xcel Energy Services Inc. Xcel Energy providing Xcel Energy dedicated long-term usage of our 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum for a term of 20 years throughout Xcel Energy s service territory in eight states (the Xcel Energy Agreement ). In connection with Xcel Energy Agreement, we entered into a guaranty agreement, under which we guaranteed the delivery of the relevant 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses in Xcel Energy s service territory in eight states along with other commercial obligations. In the event of default or non-delivery of the specific territory s 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum, we are required to refund payments we have received. In addition, to the extent we have performed any obligations, our liability and remaining obligations under the Xcel Energy Agreement will extend only to the remaining unperformed obligations. We recorded 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 67.1 million in deferred revenue in connection with the prepayments received as of September 30, 2024. We commenced delivery of the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband leases in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and will continue through 2029. The revenue recognized for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 0.8 million and 1.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum potential liability of future undiscounted payments under this agreement is approximately 63.6 million. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 In September 2023, our Board authorized the 2023 Share Repurchase Program (the 2023 Share Repurchase Program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 250.0 million of our common stock on or before September 21, 2026. We may repurchase shares of our common stock via the open market and/or privately negotiated transactions. Repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws and may be effected pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The manner, timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us based on a variety of factors, including proceeds from customer contracts, the timing of which is unpredictable, as well as general business and market conditions, our capital position, and other strategic considerations. The 2023 Share Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of our common stock. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was enacted into law on August 16, 2022, imposed a nondeductible 1 excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. Excise tax accrued for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 0.1 million. 
 The following table presents the share repurchase activity for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share data): 
 Three months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Number of shares repurchased and retired 333 63 333 Average price paid per share 32.69 32.47 32.69 Total cost to repurchase 10,735 2,027 10,735 
 Average price paid per share includes costs associated with the repurchases. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 234.0 million is remaining under the share repurchase program. 
 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we did not have and do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable. We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. However, because of the short-term nature of the highly liquid instruments in our portfolio, a 10 change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations 
 Our operations are based in the United States and, accordingly, all of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. We are currently not exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency.

Table of Contents 

 Inflation Risk 
 Inflationary factors may adversely affect our operating results. As a result of recent increases in inflation, certain of our operating expenses have increased. Additionally, although difficult to quantify, we believe that the current macroeconomic environment, including inflation, could have an adverse effect on our target customers businesses, which may harm our commercialization efforts and negatively impact our revenues. Continued periods of high inflation could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition if we are not able to control our operating costs or if our commercialization efforts are slowed or negatively impacted, continued periods of high inflation could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 We continue to monitor our market risk exposure, including any adverse impacts related to health pandemics or the current macroeconomic environment, which has resulted in significant market volatility. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of such period. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 In connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d), our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that no changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

If the Participant has provided services to the Company through the end of the End Determination Period and the highest Stock Price Level achieved during the End Determination Period equals or exceeds 66.00 per share, then that number of Signed Contract RSUs that become Vested RSUs shall be based on the Company s aggregate Contract Signings measured from the Measurement Start Date through the end of the End Determination Period, calculated on a pro rata basis (i.e., the number of Signed Contract RSUs that become Vested RSUs shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the total Signed Contract RSUs granted to the Participant 

by (ii) the ratio of (A) the Company s aggregate Contract Signings measured from the Measurement Start Date through the end of the End Determination Period divided by (B) 1,000M). If the Company s highest Stock Price Level achieved during the End Determination Period is less than 66.00 per share, then no additional Signed Contract RSUs shall become Vested RSUs. For purposes of clarity, with respect to any Determination Period (including following a termination without Cause or a resignation for Good Reason), the number of Signed Contract RSUs that shall become Vested RSUs as of the end of such Determination Period shall be calculated by deducting any Signed Contract RSUs that became Vested RSUs during prior Determination Period(s).
